### Aquera

#### Description
With 1,000+ customer deployments, Aquera delivers HR process and Identity Integration for Microsoft Active Directory (AD) and Microsoft Entra ID. Aquera automates user account provisioning and deprovisioning throughout the employee lifecycle to enable joiner, mover, leaver automation. Aqueraâ€™s prebuilt, out-of-the-box [HR Sync Connectors](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/aquerainc1584125423571.hr-sync-for-microsoft-entra-id-azure-ad-by-aquera?tab=Overview) enable 50+ HR/HCM systems of record to automate HR-driven user and account inbound provisioning to AD and Microsoft Entra ID. Beyond HR systems of record, Aquera SCIM Gateway for Microsoft Entra ID provisions and deprovisions users, accounts, and groups (where available) to non-gallery apps through industry-standard System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM). Since 2020, [Microsoft and Aquera have extended Microsoft Entra ID connectivity to hundreds of apps not found in the Microsoft Entra App Gallery](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/automate-user-provisioning-for-more-applications-with-our-new/ba-p/1751668).

The Aquera SCIM Gateway delivers out-of-the-box connectivity between Microsoft Entra ID and the provisioning target applications, directories, databases, devices, files, or 3rd-party identity providers (IDPs) for B2B partners, which aren't included in the [Microsoft Entra App Gallery](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/AppGalleryBladeV2), or where Gallery apps do not support automatic provisioning. Microsoft + Aquera extend [Microsoft Entra ID to scale identity management](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-lifecycle-management-software) as user identities, roles, and entitlements change dynamically.
The Aquera catalog of over 900 prebuilt connectors supports multiple integration methods including REST, SQL, LDAP, SOAP, and SCIM, and SCIM that isn't compatible with Microsoft Entra ID. Additionally, the connectors support web service APIs, admin console automation, SDKs, code libraries, files, and [Microsoft API-driven Inbound Provisioning](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/app-provisioning/inbound-provisioning-api-concepts).

### KloudIdentity
#### Description

KloudIdentity streamlines enterprise operations by simplifying the onboarding process of on-premises Line of Business (LOB) applications and facilitating outbound provisioning of users and groups through Microsoft Entra ID. It serves as a SCIM gateway, enabling non-SCIM compliant LOB applications to seamlessly integrate with Microsoft Entra ID. This application is founded upon a unique design paradigm known as the universal connector space, which offers a standardized platform for creating connectors for various LOB applications through a template-driven approach. This methodology significantly reduces lead time and costs associated with onboarding non-SCIM compliant LOB applications to Microsoft Entra ID for outbound provisioning.

Integration with LOB applications is primarily achieved through REST APIs, with support also extended to SOAP APIs and PowerShell scripts. Administrators can easily configure attribute mapping templates using a user-friendly web portal. Beyond graphical UI-driven attribute mapping, KloudIdentity offers a customizable policies-based approach, allowing for the configuration of highly tailored sequences of attribute mapping and payload generation.

Furthermore, KloudIdentity provides a Software Development Kit (SDK) to customize the standard connector platform, addressing complex and advanced integration scenarios. This SDK empowers users to make code modifications within the KloudIdentity framework safely and efficiently, enabling seamless integration of LOB applications for users and groups provisioning. The SCIM gateway can be deployed either as a cloud-based solution or within on-premises data centers, supporting a range of deployment options from conventional Internet Information Services (IIS) setups to Kubernetes orchestrated environments

### Traxion SCIM Gateway
#### Description
At Traxion, we believe that industry-wide standardization plays a large role in the future of Identity and Access Management (IAM). We're determined to help our customers achieve their security goals by using best practices and common standards. System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) is such a standard.

Companies deploying an IGA system are challenged with how hard it can be to connect applications for synchronizing users, groups, and other data entities.
The process of connecting and maintaining application integrations has proven to be a challenging, time-consuming, and costly process; not only for the companies deploying an IAM system but also for application vendors and integrators.
It's especially tough when connecting an application that doesn't support a common standard such as SCIM 2.0.
By using our SCIM Gateway we enable our customers to leverage the benefits of a standardized integration by reducing lead times and overall costs.

Our SCIM Gateway is an easy, secure, and standardized solution, that will enable you to synchronize all identity and access information with any non-natively SCIM supporting application.

Integrations include:

- AFAS Profit
- Splunk
- ATS
- Oracle ERP
- SAP SuccessFactors
- Tempus Resources
- Generic connectors (CSV, SQL)
- Develop your own connector using our [public SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Traxion.Scim.Gateway.Connectors.Sdk)

### Custom connectors

Microsoft Entra ID includes connectivity to provision into applications that support protocols and interfaces including SCIM, SQL, LDAP, REST, SOAP, and PowerShell.
For connectivity to applications that don't support one of those protocols and interfaces, customers and [partners](/archive/technet-wiki/1589.fim-2010-mim-2016-management-agents-from-partners) have custom Extensible Connectivity (ECMA) [connectors](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/forefront-2010/hh859557(v=vs.100)) for use with Microsoft Identity Manager (MIM) 2016. Community members have also built ECMA connectors, hosted on their blogs and in public source code repositories. These same ECMA2 connectors can be used to provision into apps with the Microsoft Entra provisioning agent and Extensible Connectivity (ECMA) Connector host, without needing to deploy MIM sync. For more information, see [provisioning with the custom connectors](~/identity/app-provisioning/on-premises-custom-connector.md).

If you have been using a custom connector with MIM, then you can [export the MIM connector configuration](~/identity/app-provisioning/on-premises-migrate-microsoft-identity-manager.md) and import it into Microsoft Entra.

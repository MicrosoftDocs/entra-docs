Administrators can take action on risky sign-in events and choose to:

- **Confirm sign-in compromised** – This action confirms the sign-in is a true positive. The sign-in is considered risky until remediation steps are taken. 
- **Confirm sign-in safe** – This action confirms the sign-in is a false positive. Similar sign-ins shouldn't be considered risky in the future. 
- **Dismiss sign-in risk** – This action is used for a benign true positive. This sign-in risk we detected is real, but not malicious, like those from a known penetration test or known activity generated by an approved application. Similar sign-ins should continue being evaluated for risk going forward.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure AD PowerShell is planned for deprecation on **March 30, 2024**. To learn more, read the [deprecation update](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/important-azure-ad-graph-retirement-and-powershell-module/ba-p/3848270). We recommend migrating to [Microsoft Graph PowerShell](/powershell/microsoftgraph/overview) to interact with Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD). Microsoft Graph PowerShell allows access to all Microsoft Graph APIs and is available on PowerShell 7. For answers to common migration queries, see the [Migration FAQ](/powershell/azure/active-directory/migration-faq).

Microsoft Entra ID may include preview, beta, or other prerelease features, services, software, or regions offered by Microsoft to obtain customer feedback ("Previews"). Previews are made available to you on the condition that you agree to these terms of use, which are outlined in the overall [Microsoft product terms for online services](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/product/ForOnlineServices/all).

Microsoft may roll out previews in phases to give Microsoft and customers the opportunity to evaluate and understand potential new features. 

> [!NOTE]
> Not all features that are in preview become generally available. While it isn't the norm, it is possible that Microsoft might cancel features during preview. 

The phases may include: 

1. **Private preview** – during this phase we invite a few customers to take part in early access to new concepts and features. This phase doesn't include formal support. 

1. **Public preview** – during this phase we allow any customer with the proper Microsoft Entra ID license to evaluate the new feature. Public previews may include limited customer support and normal service level agreements won't apply. For new features exposed in the Microsoft Entra admin center, customers can expect to see information banners in the user interface that draw attention to the new experience available during the preview. By clicking on the information banner customers then opt in to the preview experience.  

1. **Generally available (GA)** – during this phase, the feature is open for any licensed customer to use and is supported via all Microsoft support channels. Be aware when a new feature impacts existing functionality, it might change the way you or your users use the functionality. 

Each Microsoft Entra ID preview program may have different opt-in requirements and dependencies.

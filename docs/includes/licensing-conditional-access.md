[!INCLUDE [Active Directory P1 license](~/includes/entra-p1-license.md)]

Customers with [Microsoft 365 Business Premium licenses](/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-service-descriptions-technet-library) also have access to Conditional Access features. 

Risk-based policies require access to [Identity Protection](~/id-protection/overview-identity-protection.md), which is a Microsoft Entra ID P2 feature.

Microsoft Entra Suite includes all Microsoft Entra Conditional access features.

Other products and features that could interact with Conditional Access policies require appropriate licensing for those products and features.

When licenses required for Conditional Access expire, policies aren't automatically disabled or deleted. This grants customers the ability to migrate away from Conditional Access policies without a sudden change in their security posture. Remaining policies can be viewed and deleted, but no longer updated. 

[Security defaults](~/fundamentals/security-defaults.md) help protect against identity-related attacks and are available for all customers.

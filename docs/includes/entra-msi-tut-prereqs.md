- If you're not familiar with the managed identities for Azure resources feature, see this [overview](~/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md). 
- If you don't have an Azure account, [sign up for a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you continue.
- To perform the required resource creation and role management, your account needs *Owner* permissions at the appropriate scope (your subscription or resource group). If you need assistance with role assignment, see [Assign Azure roles to manage access to your Azure subscription resources](/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal).

In the source tenant: Using this feature requires Microsoft Entra ID P1 licenses. Each user who is synchronized with cross-tenant synchronization must have a P1 license in their home/source tenant. To find the right license for your requirements, see [Microsoft Entra ID Plans & Pricing](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/identity-access-management/azure-ad-pricing).

In the target tenant: Cross-tenant sync relies on the Microsoft Entra External ID billing model. To understand the external identities licensing model, see [MAU billing model for Microsoft Entra External ID](~/external-id/external-identities-pricing.md). You also need at least one Microsoft Entra ID P1 license in the target tenant to enable autoredemption.

All multitenant organizations features are included as part of Microsoft Entra suite.

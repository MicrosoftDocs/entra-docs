There are no licensing requirements for using Managed identities for Azure resources. Managed identities for Azure resources provide an automatically managed identity for applications to use when connecting to resources that support Microsoft Entra authentication. One of the benefits of using managed identities is that you donâ€™t need to manage credentials, and they can be used at no extra cost. For more information, see [What is managed identities for Azure resources?](../identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md).

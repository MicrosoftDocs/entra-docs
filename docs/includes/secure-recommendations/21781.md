Without phishing-resistant authentication methods, privileged users are more vulnerable to phishing attacks. These types of attacks trick users into revealing their credentials to grant unauthorized access to attackers. If non-phishing-resistant authentication methods are used, attackers might intercept credentials and tokens, through methods like adversary-in-the-middle attacks, undermining the security of the privileged account.

Once a privileged account or session is compromised due to weak authentication methods, attackers might manipulate the account to maintain long-term access, create other backdoors, or modify user permissions. Attackers can also use the compromised privileged account to escalate their access even further, potentially gaining control over more sensitive systems.

**Remediation action**

- [Get started with a phishing-resistant passwordless authentication deployment](/entra/identity/authentication/how-to-plan-prerequisites-phishing-resistant-passwordless-authentication)
- [Ensure that privileged accounts register and use phishing resistant methods](/entra/identity/authentication/concept-authentication-strengths#authentication-strengths)
- [Deploy Conditional Access policy to target privileged accounts and require phishing resistant credentials using authentication strengths](/entra/identity/conditional-access/policy-admin-phish-resistant-mfa)
- [Monitor authentication method activity](/entra/identity/monitoring-health/concept-usage-insights-report#authentication-methods-activity)

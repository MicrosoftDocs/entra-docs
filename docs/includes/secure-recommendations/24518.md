Enterprise applications without owners become orphaned assets that threat actors can exploit. These applications often retain elevated permissions and access to sensitive resources while lacking proper oversight and security governance.

Applications without owners create blind spots in security monitoring where attackers can establish persistence by leveraging existing application permissions to access data or create backdoor accounts. The absence of ownership also prevents proper access reviews and permission audits, allowing applications with excessive permissions or outdated configurations to remain unmanaged.

Assigning owners enables effective application lifecycle management and ensures proper security oversight.

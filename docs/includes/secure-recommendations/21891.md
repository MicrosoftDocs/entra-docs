Configuring password reset notifications for administrator roles in Microsoft Entra ID enhances security by notifying privileged administrators when another administrator resets their password. This visibility helps detect unauthorized or suspicious activity that could indicate credential compromise or insider threats. Without these notifications, malicious actors could exploit elevated privileges to establish persistence, escalate access, or extract sensitive data. Proactive notifications support quick action, preserve privileged access integrity, and strengthen the overall security posture.

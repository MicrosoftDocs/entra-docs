Set up risk-based Conditional Access policies for workload identities based on risk policy in Microsoft Entra ID to make sure only trusted and verified workloads use sensitive resources. Without these policies, threat actors can compromise workload identities with minimal detection and perform further attacks. Without conditional controls to detect anomalous activity and other risks, there's no check against malicious operations like token forgery, access to sensitive resources, and disruption of workloads. The lack of automated containment mechanisms increases dwell time and affects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical services.   

**Remediation action**
Create a risk-based Conditional Access policy for workload identities.

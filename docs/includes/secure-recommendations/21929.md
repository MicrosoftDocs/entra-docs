Access packages for guest users without expiration dates or access reviews allow indefinite access to organizational resources. Compromised or stale guest accounts enable threat actors to maintain persistent, undetected access for lateral movement, privilege escalation, and data exfiltration. Without periodic validation, organizations cannot identify when business relationships change or when guest access is no longer needed.

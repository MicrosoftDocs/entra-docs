Without enforced approval on entitlement management policies that allow external users, a threat actor can self-orchestrate initial access by submitting unattended requests that are auto-approved. Each successful request provisions or reuses a guest user object and grants access to resources included in the access package, immediately expanding reconnaissance surface. From that foothold the actor can enumerate additional collaboration surfaces, harvest shared files, and probe mis-scoped app permissions to escalate (for example, abusing over-privileged group-based roles or app role assignments). They can persist by requesting multiple packages with overlapping or escalating privileges, re-extending assignments if expiration or reviews are lax, or by creating indirect sharing links inside granted SharePoint or Teams resources. Absence of an approval gate also removes a human anomaly check (sponsor/internal/external approver) that would otherwise filter suspicious volume, timing, geography, or improbable justification patterns, shrinking detection dwell-time.

- [Configure approval for external request policies](/entra/id-governance/entitlement-management-access-package-approval-policy)
- [Review and update access package assignment policies to require approval for external users](/entra/id-governance/entitlement-management-access-package-request-policy)

Access package assignment policies that allow external users to request access should require approval. Without an approval gate, external users can self-provision access to organizational resources without oversight. Requiring approval ensures that a designated approver reviews each request, providing an opportunity to validate the requestor's identity and business justification before granting access.

**Remediation action**

- [Configure approval for access package assignment policies](/entra/id-governance/entitlement-management-access-package-approval-policy)
- [Review access package policies for external users](/entra/id-governance/entitlement-management-access-package-request-policy)

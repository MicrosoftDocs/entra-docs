Risky sign-ins flagged by Microsoft Entra ID Protection indicate a high probability of unauthorized access attempts. Threat actors use these sign-ins to gain an initial foothold. If these sign-ins remain uninvestigated, adversaries can establish persistence by repeatedly authenticating under the guise of legitimate users. 

A lack of response lets attackers execute reconnaissance, attempt to escalate their access, and blend into normal patterns. When untriaged sign-ins continue to generate alerts and there's no intervention, security gaps widen, facilitating lateral movement and defense evasion, as adversaries recognize the absence of an active security response.

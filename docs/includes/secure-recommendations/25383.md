Excessive assignment of roles like Global Administrator and Global Secure Access Administrator create a path for threat actors to compromise these identities. With these roles an attacker can authenticate, manipulate security policies, create or elevate accounts, disable monitoring, access all corporate data, and more. Limit access to these roles to a small set of administrators, and enable monitoring of assignments and activation for groups, guests, service principals, and disabled accounts to reduce the attack surface and enforce least privilege.

**Remediation action**

- [Emergency access accounts are configured appropriately](/entra/fundamentals/zero-trust-protect-engineering-systems#emergency-access-accounts-are-configured-appropriately)
- [Limit Global Administrator and Global Secure Access Administrator role assignments to a small set of administrators.](/entra/fundamentals/zero-trust-protect-identities#high-global-administrator-to-privileged-user-ratio)

Requiring sign-ins from managed devices ensures that users access organizational resources only from devices that meet your security and compliance requirements. Unmanaged devices lack organizational security controls and endpoint protection, creating potential entry points for attackers. Using Conditional Access to require compliant or Microsoft Entra hybrid joined devices helps protect against credential theft and unauthorized access from untrusted endpoints.

**Remediation action**

- [Require compliant or hybrid joined devices with Conditional Access](/entra/identity/conditional-access/policy-all-users-device-compliance)
- [Configure device compliance policies in Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/protect/device-compliance-get-started)

Without proper application management policies, threat actors can exploit weak or misconfigured application credentials to get unauthorized access to organizational resources. Applications using long-lived password secrets or certificates create extended attack windows where compromised credentials stay valid for extended periods. If an application uses client secrets that are hardcoded in configuration files or have weak password requirements, threat actors can extract these credentials through different means, including source code repositories, configuration dumps, or memory analysis. If threat actors get these credentials, they can perform lateral movement within the environment, escalate privileges if the application has elevated permissions, establish persistence by creating more backdoor credentials, modify application configuration, or exfiltrate data. The lack of credential lifecycle management lets compromised credentials remain active indefinitely, giving threat actors sustained access to organizational assets and the ability to conduct data exfiltration, system manipulation, or deploy more malicious tools without detection. 

Configuring appropriate app management policies helps organizations stay ahead of these threats.

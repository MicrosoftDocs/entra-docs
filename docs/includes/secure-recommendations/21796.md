Legacy authentication protocols such as basic authentication for SMTP and IMAP don't support modern security features like multifactor authentication (MFA), which is crucial for protecting against unauthorized access. This lack of protection makes accounts using these protocols vulnerable to password-based attacks, and provides attackers with a means to gain initial access using stolen or guessed credentials.

When an attacker successfully gains unauthorized access to credentials, they can use them to access linked services, using the weak authentication method as an entry point. Attackers who gain access through legacy authentication might make changes to Microsoft Exchange, such as configuring mail forwarding rules or changing other settings, allowing them to maintain continued access to sensitive communications.

Legacy authentication also provides attackers with a consistent method to reenter a system using compromised credentials without triggering security alerts or requiring reauthentication.

From there, attackers can use legacy protocols to access other systems that are accessible via the compromised account, facilitating lateral movement. Attackers using legacy protocols can blend in with legitimate user activities, making it difficult for security teams to distinguish between normal usage and malicious behavior.

**Remediation action**

Deploy the following Conditional Access policy:

- [Block legacy authentication](/entra/identity/conditional-access/policy-block-legacy-authentication)

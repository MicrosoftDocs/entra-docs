App instance property lock prevents changes to sensitive properties of a multitenant application after the application is provisioned in another tenant. Without a lock, critical properties such as application credentials can be maliciously or unintentionally modified, causing disruptions, increased risk, unauthorized access, or privilege escalations.

**Remediation action**
Enable the app instance property lock for all multitenant applications and specify the properties to lock.

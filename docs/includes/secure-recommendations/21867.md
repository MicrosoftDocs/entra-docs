Without owners, enterprise applications become orphaned assets that threat actors can exploit through credential harvesting and privilege escalation techniques. These applications often retain elevated permissions and access to sensitive resources while lacking proper oversight and security governance. The elevation of privilege to owners can raise a security concern in some cases depending on the application's permissions, but more critically, applications without an owner create a blind spot in security monitoring where threat actors can establish persistence by leveraging existing application permissions to access data or create backdoor accounts without triggering ownership-based detection mechanisms.

When applications lack owners, security teams cannot effectively conduct application lifecycle management, leaving applications with potentially excessive permissions, outdated configurations, or compromised credentials that threat actors can discover through enumeration techniques and exploit to move laterally within the environment. The absence of ownership also prevents proper access reviews and permission audits, allowing threat actors to maintain long-term access through applications that should have been decommissioned or had their permissions reduced. Not maintaining a clean application portfolio can provide persistent access vectors that can be leveraged for data exfiltration or further compromise of the environment.

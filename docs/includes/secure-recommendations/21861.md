Users considered at high risk by Microsoft Entra ID Protection have a high probability of compromise by threat actors. Threat actors can gain initial access via compromised valid accounts, where their suspicious activities continue despite triggering risk indicators. This oversight can enable persistence as threat actors perform activities that normally warrant investigation, such as unusual login patterns or suspicious inbox manipulation. 

A lack of triage of these risky users allows for expanded reconnaissance activities and lateral movement, with anomalous behavior patterns continuing to generate uninvestigated alerts. Threat actors become emboldened as security teams show they aren't actively responding to risk indicators.

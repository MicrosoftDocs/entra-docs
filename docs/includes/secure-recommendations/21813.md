When organizations maintain a disproportionately high ratio of Global Administrators relative to their total privileged user population, they expose themselves to significant security risks that threat actors might exploit through various attack vectors. Excessive Global Administrator assignments create multiple high-value targets for threat actors who might leverage initial access through credential compromise, phishing attacks, or insider threats to gain unrestricted access to the entire Microsoft Entra ID tenant and connected Microsoft 365 services. 

**Remediation action**

- [Minimize the number of Global Administrator role assignments](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/best-practices#5-limit-the-number-of-global-administrators-to-less-than-5)

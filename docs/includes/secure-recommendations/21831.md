Threat actors who gain privileged access to a tenant can manipulate identity, access, and security configurations, disable critical controls, exfiltrate sensitive data, create persistent backdoors, and escalate privileges across cloud resources, resulting in environment-wide compromise and loss of control over organizational assets. Protected actions in Microsoft Entra ID are permissions that have been assigned Conditional Access policies. Microsoft recommends enforcing security controls such as stronger authentication methods (Passwordless MFA or Phishing-resistant MFA), usage of Privileged Access Workstation (PAW) devices and/or shorter session time-outs, on all available permissions. 

**Remediation action**

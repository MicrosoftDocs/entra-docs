Threat actors who gain privileged access to a tenant can manipulate identity, access, and security configurations. This type of attack can result in environment-wide compromise and loss of control over organizational assets. Take action to protect high-impact management tasks associated with Conditional Access policies, cross-tenant access settings, hard deletions, and network locations that are critical to maintaining security.

Protected actions let administrators secure these tasks with extra security controls, such as stronger authentication methods (passwordless MFA or phishing-resistant MFA), the use of Privileged Access Workstation (PAW) devices, or shorter session timeouts.

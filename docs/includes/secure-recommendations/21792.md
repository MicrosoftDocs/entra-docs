External user accounts are often used to provide access to business partners who belong to organizations that have a business relationship with your enterprise. If these accounts are compromised in their organization, attackers can use the valid credentials to gain initial access to your environment, often bypassing traditional defenses due to their legitimacy.  

External accounts with permissions to read directory object permissions provide attackers with broader initial access if compromised. These accounts allow attackers to gather additional information from the directory for reconnaissance.

**Remediation action**

- [Restrict guest access to their own directory objects](/entra/external-id/external-collaboration-settings-configure#to-configure-guest-user-access)

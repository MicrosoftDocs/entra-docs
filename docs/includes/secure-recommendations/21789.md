When tenant creation events are not monitored, threat actors can establish unauthorized tenants to facilitate their operations without detection. Tenant creation is captured in audit logs under the DirectoryManagement category, and without triage, threat actors who have compromised credentials with sufficient permissions can create shadow tenants to exfiltrate data or maintain persistence outside the monitored environment. These unauthorized tenants can then be used to register malicious applications that appear legitimate, enabling threat actors to authenticate using the newly created tenant's identity framework and bypass existing security controls in the primary tenant(s). The compromised credentials used to create the unauthorized tenant may then be leveraged to establish cross-tenant synchronization or guest access relationships, allowing lateral movement between the legitimate and malicious tenants. Once established, threat actors can use the unauthorized tenant to register service principals with credentials that enable automated access to resources, establishing a persistent backdoor that operates independently of the primary tenant's security monitoring.

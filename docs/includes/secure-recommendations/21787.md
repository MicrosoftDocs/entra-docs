A threat actor or a well-intentioned but uninformed employee can create a new Microsoft Entra tenant if there are no restrictions in place. By default, the user who creates a tenant is automatically assigned the Global Administrator role. Without proper controls, this action fractures the identity perimeter by creating a tenant outside the organization's governance and visibility. It introduces risk though a shadow identity platform that can be exploited for token issuance, brand impersonation, consent phishing, or persistent staging infrastructure. Since the rogue tenant might not be tethered to the enterpriseâ€™s administrative or monitoring planes, traditional defenses are blind to its creation, activity, and potential misuse.

**Remediation action**

Enable the **Restrict non-admin users from creating tenants** setting. For users that need the ability to create tenants, assign them the Tenant Creator role. You can also review tenant creation events in the Microsoft Entra audit logs.

- [Restrict member users' default permissions](/entra/fundamentals/users-default-permissions#restrict-member-users-default-permissions)
- [Assign the Tenant Creator role](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#tenant-creator)
- [Review tenant creation events](/entra/identity/monitoring-health/reference-audit-activities#core-directory). Look for OperationName=="Create Company", Category == "DirectoryManagement".

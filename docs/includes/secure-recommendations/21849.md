When Smart Lockout duration is configured below the default 60 seconds, threat actors can exploit shortened lockout periods to conduct password spray and credential stuffing attacks more effectively. Reduced lockout windows allow attackers to resume authentication attempts more rapidly, increasing their success probability while potentially evading detection systems that rely on longer observation periods. 

**Remediation action**

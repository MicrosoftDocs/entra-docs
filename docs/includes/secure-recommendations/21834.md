Directory synchronization accounts are highly privileged service accounts used by Microsoft Entra Connect to synchronize identities between on-premises Active Directory and Microsoft Entra ID. Restricting these accounts to specific named locations using Conditional Access policies prevents unauthorized access from untrusted networks. If compromised, these accounts could be used to manipulate identity synchronization, create unauthorized accounts, or escalate privileges.

**Remediation action**

- [Configure named locations in Conditional Access](/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-assignment-network)
- [Create a Conditional Access policy to block access from untrusted locations](/entra/identity/conditional-access/policy-block-by-location)
- [Review Microsoft Entra Connect security best practices](/entra/identity/hybrid/connect/how-to-connect-install-prerequisites#harden-your-microsoft-entra-connect-server)

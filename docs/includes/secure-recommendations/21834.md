Directory synchronization accounts are highly privileged service accounts that facilitate identity synchronization between on-premises Active Directory and Microsoft Entra ID. Without location-based access controls, threat actors who compromise these accounts can synchronize malicious changes from any location, including unauthorized geographic regions or untrusted networks. Once a directory sync account is compromised, threat actors can exploit their elevated permissions to manipulate identity synchronization processes, create unauthorized user accounts, escalate privileges of existing accounts, or persist access by modifying synchronization rules. The unrestricted network access allows threat actors to operate remotely from potentially compromised infrastructure, making detection and response more difficult while enabling them to maintain long-term access to the organization's hybrid identity environment.

**Remediation action**

- [Configure named locations in Conditional Access](/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-assignment-network)
- [Create a Conditional Access policy targeting the Directory Synchronization Accounts role to block access from untrusted locations](/entra/identity/conditional-access/policy-block-by-location)
- [Review Microsoft Entra Connect security best practices](/entra/identity/hybrid/connect/how-to-connect-install-prerequisites#harden-your-microsoft-entra-connect-server)

Without sign-in context, threat actors can exploit authentication fatigue by flooding users with push notifications, increasing the chance that a user accidentally approves a malicious request. When users get generic push notifications without the application name or geographic location, they don't have the information they need to make informed approval decisions. This lack of context makes users vulnerable to social engineering attacks, especially when threat actors time their requests during periods of legitimate user activity. This vulnerability is especially dangerous when threat actors gain initial access through credential harvesting or password spraying attacks and then try to establish persistence by approving multifactor authentication (MFA) requests from unexpected applications or locations. Without contextual information, users can't detect unusual sign-in attempts, allowing threat actors to maintain access and escalate privileges by moving laterally through systems after bypassing the initial authentication barrier. Without application and location context, security teams also lose valuable telemetry for detecting suspicious authentication patterns that can indicate ongoing compromise or reconnaissance activities.   

**Remediation action**
Give users the context they need to make informed approval decisions. Configure Microsoft Authenticator notifications by setting the Authentication methods policy to include the application name and geographic location.

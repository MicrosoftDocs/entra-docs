Entitlement management policies without expiration dates create persistent access that threat actors can exploit. When user assignments lack time bounds, compromised credentials maintain indefinite access, enabling attackers to establish persistence, escalate privileges through additional access packages, and conduct long-term malicious activities while remaining undetected. 

**Remediation action**

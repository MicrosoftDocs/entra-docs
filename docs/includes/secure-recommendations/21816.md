Threat actors who compromise permanently assigned privileged accounts gain continuous access to high-impact directory operations. This extended access allows attackers to establish persistent backdoors, modify security configurations, and disable monitoring systems. Without time-limited access controls, compromised privileged accounts provide indefinite tenant control.

Requiring eligible role assignments to be activated just-in-time, reduces the attack surface and limits attacker dwell time.

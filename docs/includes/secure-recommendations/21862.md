Compromised workload identities (service principals and applications) allow threat actors to gain persistent access without user interaction or multifactor authentication. Microsoft Entra ID Protection monitors these identities for suspicious activities like leaked credentials, anomalous API traffic, and malicious applications. Unaddressed risky workload identities enable privilege escalation, lateral movement, data exfiltration, and persistent backdoors that bypass traditional security controls. Organizations must systematically investigate and remediate these risks to prevent unauthorized access.

Threat actors frequently target stale privileged accounts as they represent high-value, low-detection attack vectors. When privileged Microsoft Entra roles remain assigned to identities showing no recent sign-in activity, attackers can compromise these dormant credentials through password spray attacks, credential stuffing, or token replay without triggering normal behavioral analytics. Once accessed, these stale privileged identities provide immediate administrative capabilities across the tenant without the typical user interaction patterns that would alert security teams. The compromised identity can then be leveraged for persistence by creating backdoor accounts, modifying security policies, or accessing sensitive resources. Additionally, inactive service principals with privileged roles become attractive targets for application-based attacks, where threat actors can abuse stored credentials or certificates to maintain long-term administrative access while evading user-focused monitoring controls.

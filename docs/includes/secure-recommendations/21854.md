Privileged roles should not remain assigned to identities that show no recent sign-in activity. Stale accounts with administrative privileges are attractive targets for attackers because they can be compromised without triggering behavioral analytics alerts. Regularly reviewing and removing privileged role assignments from inactive identities reduces the risk of credential-based attacks and helps maintain least-privilege access.

**Remediation action**

- [Remove privileged role assignments from inactive identities](/entra/id-governance/privileged-identity-management/pim-resource-roles-assign-roles#update-or-remove-an-existing-role-assignment)

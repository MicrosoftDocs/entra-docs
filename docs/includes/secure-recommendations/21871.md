Enabling security defaults in Microsoft Entra is essential for organizations with Microsoft Entra Free licenses to protect against identity-related attacks. These attacks can lead to unauthorized access, financial loss, and reputational damage. Security defaults require all users to register for multifactor authentication (MFA), ensure administrators use MFA, and block legacy authentication protocols. This significantly reduces the risk of successful attacks, as more than 99% of common identity-related attacks are stopped by using MFA and blocking legacy authentication. Security defaults offer baseline protection at no extra cost, making them accessible for all organizations.

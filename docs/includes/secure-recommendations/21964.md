Threat actors who gain privileged access to a tenant can manipulate Conditional Access policies, potentially disabling critical security controls and enabling persistent access or lateral movement. This type of attack can result in environment-wide compromise by bypassing authentication and authorization barriers.

Protected actions let administrators secure Conditional Access policy creation and modification with extra security controls, such as stronger authentication methods (passwordless MFA or phishing-resistant MFA), the use of Privileged Access Workstation (PAW) devices, or shorter session timeouts.

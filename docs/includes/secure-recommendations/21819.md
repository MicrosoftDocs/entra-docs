Without activation alerts for Global Administrator role assignments, threat actors can escalate privileges undetected. This lack of visibility creates a blind spot where attackers can activate the most privileged role and perform malicious actions such as creating backdoor accounts, modifying security policies, or accessing sensitive data.

Monitoring these activation alerts can help security teams distinguish between authorized and unauthorized privilege escalation activities.

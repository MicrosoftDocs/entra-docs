When local administrators on Microsoft Entra joined devices aren't properly managed, threat actors with compromised credentials can execute device takeover attacks by removing organizational administrators and disabling the device's connection to Microsoft Entra. This lack of control results in complete loss of organizational control, creating orphaned assets that can't be managed or recovered.

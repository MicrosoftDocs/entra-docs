Web Content Filtering in Microsoft Entra Internet Access helps organizations control access to websites based on web categories, domains, or URLs. It reduces exposure to malicious or inappropriate content. When you route traffic through Microsoft Entra Internet Access, filtering policies can block or allow entire categories like gambling or social media, or specific domains and URLs. This approach ensures safer browsing across all devices and locations.

Configuring these policies is critical for security and compliance. A secure configuration prevents phishing and malware risks, enforces corporate standards, and improves productivity by restricting nonbusiness sites. Web Content Filtering, combined with identity-aware Conditional Access, delivers dynamic, cloud-based protection that aligns with modern Zero Trust principles. 

**Remediation action**
Implement granular internet access controls for your organization based on website categorization.

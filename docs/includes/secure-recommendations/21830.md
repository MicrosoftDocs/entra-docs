If privileged role activations aren't restricted to dedicated Privileged Access Workstations (PAWs), threat actors can exploit compromised endpoint devices to perform privileged escalation attacks from unmanaged or noncompliant workstations. Standard productivity workstations often contain attack vectors such as unrestricted web browsing, email clients vulnerable to phishing, and locally installed applications with potential vulnerabilities. When administrators activated privileged roles from these workstations, threat actors who gain initial access through malware, browser exploits, or social engineering can then use the locally cached privileged credentials or hijack existing authenticated sessions to escalate their privileges. Privileged role activations grant extensive administrative rights across Microsoft Entra ID and connected services, so attackers can create new administrative accounts, modify security policies, access sensitive data across all organizational resources, and deploy malware or backdoors throughout the environment to establish persistent access. This lateral movement from a compromised endpoint to privileged cloud resources represents a critical attack path that bypasses many traditional security controls. The privileged access appears legitimate when originating from an authenticated administrator's session.

If this check passes, your tenant has a Conditional Access policy that restricts privileged role access to PAW devices, but it isn't the only control required to fully enable a PAW solution. You also need to configure an Intune device configuration and compliance policy and a device filter.

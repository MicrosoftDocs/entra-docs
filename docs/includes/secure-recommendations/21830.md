Without restricting privileged role activations to dedicated Privileged Access Workstations (PAWs), threat actors can exploit compromised endpoint devices to perform privileged escalation attacks from unmanaged or non-compliant workstations. When administrators activate privileged roles from standard productivity workstations, these devices often contain attack vectors such as unrestricted web browsing, email clients vulnerable to phishing, and locally installed applications with potential vulnerabilities. Threat actors who gain initial access through malware, browser exploits, or social engineering can then leverage the locally-cached privileged credentials or hijack existing authenticated sessions to escalate their privileges. Because privileged role activations grant extensive administrative rights across Microsoft Entra ID and connected services, attackers can create new administrative accounts, modify security policies, access sensitive data across all organizational resources, and deploy malware or backdoors throughout the environment to establish persistent access. This lateral movement from a compromised endpoint to privileged cloud resources represents a critical attack path that bypasses many traditional security controls, because the privileged access appears legitimate when originating from an authenticated administrator's session.

If this check passes, your tenant has a Conditional Access policy that restricts privileged role access to PAW devices, but it is not the only control required to fully enable a PAW solution. You also need to configure an Intune device configuration and compliance policy and a device filter.

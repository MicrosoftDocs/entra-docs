Controlling device proliferation is important. Set a reasonable limit on the number of devices each user can register in your Microsoft Entra ID tenant. Limiting device registration maintains security while allowing business flexibility. Microsoft Entra ID lets users register up to 50 devices by default. Reducing this number to 10 minimizes the attack surface and simplifies device management.

An excessive number of Global Administrator accounts creates an expanded attack surface that threat actors can exploit through various initial access vectors. Each additional privileged account represents a potential entry point for threat actors. An excess of Global Administrator accounts undermines the principle of least privilege. Microsoft recommends that organizations have no more than eight Global Administrators.

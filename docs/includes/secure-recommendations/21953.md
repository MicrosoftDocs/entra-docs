Without Local Admin Password Solution (LAPS) deployed, threat actors exploit static local administrator passwords to establish initial access. After threat actors compromise a single device with a shared local administrator credential, they can move laterally across the environment and authenticate to other systems sharing the same password. Compromised local administrator access gives threat actors system-level privileges, letting them disable security controls, install persistent backdoors, exfiltrate sensitive data, and establish command and control channels. 

The automated password rotation and centralized management of LAPS closes this security gap and adds controls to help manage who has access to these critical accounts. Without solutions like LAPS, you can't detect or respond to unauthorized use of local administrator accounts, giving threat actors extended dwell time to achieve their objectives while remaining undetected.

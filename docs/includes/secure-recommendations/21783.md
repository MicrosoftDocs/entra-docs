Without phishing-resistant authentication methods, privileged users are more vulnerable to phishing attacks. These types of attacks trick users into revealing their credentials to grant unauthorized access to attackers. If non-phishing-resistant authentication methods are used, attackers might intercept credentials and tokens, through methods like adversary-in-the-middle attacks, undermining the security of the privileged account.

Once a privileged account or session is compromised due to weak authentication methods, attackers might manipulate the account to maintain long-term access, create other backdoors, or modify user permissions. Attackers can also use the compromised privileged account to escalate their access even further, potentially gaining control over more sensitive systems.

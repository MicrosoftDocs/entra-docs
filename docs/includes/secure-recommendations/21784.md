Phishing-resistant authentication methods like passkeys and FIDO2 security keys provide the strongest protection against credential theft and sophisticated phishing attacks. Traditional MFA methods remain vulnerable to adversary-in-the-middle attacks and social engineering. Enforcing phishing-resistant methods for all users through Conditional Access policies helps prevent unauthorized access even when attackers attempt to intercept authentication flows.

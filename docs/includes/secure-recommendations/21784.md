When phishing-resistant authentication methods are not enforced, threat actors can compromise credentials through various phishing techniques. Multifactor authentication is one of the most effective controls to prevent an adversary from gaining access to sensitive information, but traditional MFA methods remain vulnerable to sophisticated attacks. With compromised credentials, threat actors establish initial access to organizational resources and begin reconnaissance to identify valuable data and systems. They leverage legitimate access patterns to avoid detection while moving laterally through the environment, escalating privileges, and establishing persistence mechanisms. The compromised account serves as a foothold for data exfiltration, system manipulation, or deployment of additional malicious tools. Without phishing-resistant authentication barriers, threat actors can maintain long-term access to organizational resources, leading to data breaches, financial losses, and regulatory compliance violations.

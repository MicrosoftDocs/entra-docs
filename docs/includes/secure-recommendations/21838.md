FIDO2 security keys provide hardware-backed, phishing-resistant authentication that protects against credential theft and unauthorized access. Security keys use cryptographic proof of identity bound to a specific device, making credentials impossible to replicate or phish. Enabling this authentication method allows users to register security keys for strong passwordless authentication.

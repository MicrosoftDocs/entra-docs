Leaving high-priority Microsoft Entra recommendations unaddressed can create a gap in an organizationâ€™s security posture, offering threat actors opportunities to exploit known weaknesses. Not acting on these items might result in an increased attack surface area, suboptimal operations, or poor user experience. 

**Remediation action**

- [Address all high priority recommendations in the Microsoft Entra admin center](/entra/identity/monitoring-health/overview-recommendations#how-does-it-work)

Global Administrators with persistent access to Azure subscriptions expand the attack surface for threat actors. If a Global Administrator account is compromised, attackers can immediately enumerate resources, modify configurations, assign roles, and exfiltrate sensitive data across all subscriptions. Requiring just-in-time elevation for subscription access introduces detectable signals, slows attacker velocity, and routes high-impact operations through observable control points.

- [Ensure that privileged accounts register and use phishing resistant methods](/entra/identity/authentication/concept-authentication-strengths#authentication-strengths.md)

- [Deploy Conditional Access policy to target privileged accounts and require phishing resistant credentials using authentication strengths](/entra/identity/conditional-access/policy-admin-phish-resistant-mfa.md)

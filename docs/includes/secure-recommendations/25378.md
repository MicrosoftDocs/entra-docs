When default outbound B2B collaboration settings allow all users to access all applications in any external Microsoft Entra organization, organizations lose control over where corporate data flows and who employees collaborate with. Users might intentionally or accidentally upload sensitive data to external tenants, accept invitations from spoofed or malicious tenants designed for phishing, or grant OAuth consent to risky applications that compromise corporate data.

External tenants operate outside the organization's security perimeter, meaning Conditional Access policies, Data Loss Prevention, and sensitivity labels can't be enforced, and user activity can't be audited. For regulated industries, unrestricted external collaboration might violate data residency requirements or prohibitions on sharing data with unapproved organizations. Additionally, users might unintentionally affiliate with customers', vendors', or competitors' tenants, creating brand confusion and support burden when external tenant issues are escalated to internal IT.

By blocking default outbound B2B collaboration, organizations enforce a deny-by-default posture that restricts external relationships to vetted partners, protects intellectual property, and ensures visibility over every cross-tenant collaboration.

**Remediation action**
- Understand cross-tenant access settings and planning considerations before making changes. For more information, see [Cross-tenant access overview](/entra/external-id/cross-tenant-access-overview).
- Use the cross-tenant access activity workbook to identify current external collaboration patterns before blocking default access. For more information, see [Cross-tenant access activity workbook](/entra/identity/monitoring-health/workbook-cross-tenant-access-activity).
- Configure default outbound B2B collaboration settings to block access. For more information, see [Modify outbound access settings](/entra/external-id/cross-tenant-access-settings-b2b-collaboration#modify-outbound-access-settings).
- Add organization-specific settings for approved partner tenants that require B2B collaboration. For more information, see [Add an organization](/entra/external-id/cross-tenant-access-settings-b2b-collaboration#add-an-organization).
- Update default cross-tenant access policy via Microsoft Graph API. For more information, see [Update default cross-tenant access policy](/graph/api/crosstenantaccesspolicyconfigurationdefault-update).

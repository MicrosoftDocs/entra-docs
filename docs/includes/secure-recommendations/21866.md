Microsoft Entra recommendations give organizations opportunities to implement best practices and optimize their security posture. Not acting on these items might result in an increased attack surface area, suboptimal operations, or poor user experience.

**Remediation action**

- [Address all active or postponed recommendations in the Microsoft Entra admin center](/entra/identity/monitoring-health/overview-recommendations#how-does-it-work)

When you create a new Microsoft Entra tenant, you become the first user of that tenant. As the first user, you're automatically assigned the [Global Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#global-administrator) role. Review your user account by navigating to the [**Users**](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/UsersManagementMenuBlade/MsGraphUsers) page.

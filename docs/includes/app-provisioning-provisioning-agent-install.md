## Install and configure the Microsoft Entra Connect Provisioning Agent

If you have already downloaded the provisioning agent and configured it for another on-premises application, then continue reading in the next section.
 1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#application-administrator).
 2. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications**.
 3. Search for the **On-premises ECMA app** application, give the app a name, and select **Create** to add it to your tenant.
 4. From the menu, navigate to the **Provisioning** page of your application.
 5. Select **Get started**.
 6. On the **Provisioning** page, change the mode to **Automatic**.

 11. The provisioning agent will use the operating system's web browser to display a popup window for you to authenticate to Microsoft Entra ID, and potentially also your organization's identity provider.  If you are using Internet Explorer as the browser on Windows Server, then you may need to add Microsoft web sites to your browser's trusted site list to allow JavaScript to run correctly.
 12. Provide credentials for a Microsoft Entra administrator when you're prompted to authorize. The user is required to have the Hybrid Identity Administrator or Global Administrator role.
 13. Select **Confirm** to confirm the setting. Once installation is successful, you can select **Exit**, and also close the Provisioning Agent Package installer.

## Configure the On-premises ECMA app

 1. In the portal, on the **On-Premises Connectivity** section, select the agent that you deployed and select **Assign Agent(s)**.

## Configure the Microsoft Entra ECMA Connector Host certificate

 1. On the Windows Server where the provisioning agent is installed, right click the **Microsoft ECMA2Host Configuration Wizard** from the start menu, and run as administrator.  Running as a Windows administrator is necessary for the wizard to create the necessary Windows event logs.
 
 1. After the ECMA Connector Host Configuration starts, if it's the first time you have run the wizard, it will ask you to create a certificate. Leave the default port **8585** and select **Generate certificate** to generate a certificate. The autogenerated certificate will be self-signed as part of the trusted root. The certificate SAN matches the host name.

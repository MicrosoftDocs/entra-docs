To use Azure Workbooks for Microsoft Entra ID, you need:

- A Microsoft Entra tenant with a [Premium P1 license](~/fundamentals/get-started-premium.md)
- A Log Analytics workspace *and* access to that workspace
- The appropriate roles for Azure Monitor *and* Microsoft Entra ID

### Log Analytics workspace

You must create a [Log Analytics workspace](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/quick-create-workspace) *before* you can use Microsoft Entra Workbooks. several factors determine access to Log Analytics workspaces. You need the right roles for the workspace *and* the resources sending the data.

For more information, see [Manage access to Log Analytics workspaces](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/manage-access).

### Azure Monitor roles

Azure Monitor provides [two built-in roles](/azure/azure-monitor/roles-permissions-security#monitoring-reader) for viewing monitoring data and editing monitoring settings. Azure role-based access control (RBAC) also provides two Log Analytics built-in roles that grant similar access.

- **View**:
  - Monitoring Reader
  - Log Analytics Reader

- **View and modify settings**:
  - Monitoring Contributor
  - Log Analytics Contributor

### Microsoft Entra roles

The cross-tenant synchronization setting is an inbound only organizational setting to allow the administrator of a source tenant to synchronize users into a target tenant. This setting is a check box with the name **Allow users sync into this tenant** that is specified in the target tenant. This setting doesn't impact B2B invitations created through other processes such as [manual invitation](~/external-id/add-users-administrator.yml) or [Microsoft Entra entitlement management](~/id-governance/entitlement-management-external-users.md).

### Administrative units

Using administrative units requires a Microsoft Entra ID P1 license for each administrative unit administrator who is assigned directory roles over the scope of the administrative unit, and a Microsoft Entra ID Free license for each administrative unit member. Creating administrative units is available with a Microsoft Entra ID Free license. If you are using rules for dynamic membership groups for administrative units, each administrative unit member requires a Microsoft Entra ID P1 license. To find the right license for your requirements, see [Comparing generally available features of the Free and Premium editions](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/identity-access-management/azure-ad-pricing).

### Restricted management administrative units

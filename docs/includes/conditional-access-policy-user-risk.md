### Passwordless scenarios

For organizations that adopt [passwordless authentication methods](/entra/identity/authentication/howto-authentication-passwordless-deployment) make the following changes: 

#### Update your passwordless user risk policy

1. Under **Users**:
   1. **Include**, select **Users and groups** and target your passwordless users.
1. Under **Access controls** > **Block** access for passwordless users.

> [!TIP]
> You might need to have two policies for a period of time while deploying passwordless methods. 
> - One that allows self-remediation for those not using passwordless methods. 
> - Another that blocks passwordless users at high risk.

#### Remediate and unblock passwordless user risk

1. Require administrator [investigation and remediation](/entra/id-protection/howto-identity-protection-investigate-risk) of any risk.
1. Unblock the user.

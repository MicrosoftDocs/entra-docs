>[!IMPORTANT]
>The public preview of Group Writeback v2 in Microsoft Entra Connect Sync is no longer available as of **June 30, 2024**. This feature was discontinued on this date, and you're no longer supported in Microsoft Entra Connect Sync to provision cloud security groups to Active Directory. The feature continues to operate beyond the discontinuation date; however, it no longer receives support and might cease functioning at any time without notice.
>
>We offer similar functionality in Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync called [Group Provision to Active Directory](~/identity/hybrid/cloud-sync/how-to-configure-entra-to-active-directory.md) that you can use instead of Group Writeback v2 for provisioning cloud security groups to Active Directory. We're working on enhancing this functionality in Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync along with other new features that we're developing in Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync.
>
>Customers who use this preview feature in Microsoft Entra Connect Sync should [switch their configuration from Microsoft Entra Connect Sync to Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync](https://aka.ms/GWBV2toGPADCS). You can choose to move all your hybrid sync to Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync (if it supports your needs). You can also run Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync side by side and move only cloud security group provisioning to Active Directory onto Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync.
>
>For customers who provision Microsoft 365 groups to Active Directory, you can keep using Group Writeback v1 for this capability.
>
>You can evaluate moving exclusively to Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync by using the [user synchronization wizard](https://aka.ms/EvaluateSyncOptions).

> If you assign a Microsoft Entra built-in role to a guest user, the guest user will be elevated to have the same permissions as a member user. For information about member and guest user default permissions, see [What are the default user permissions in Microsoft Entra ID?](../fundamentals/users-default-permissions.md)

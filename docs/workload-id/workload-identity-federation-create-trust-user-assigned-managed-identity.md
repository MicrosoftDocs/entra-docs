# Configure a user-assigned managed identity to trust an external identity provider

This article describes how to manage a federated identity credential on a user-assigned managed identity in Microsoft Entra ID.  The federated identity credential creates a trust relationship between a user-assigned managed identity and an external identity provider (IdP).  Configuring a federated identity credential on a system-assigned managed identity isn't supported.

After you configure your user-assigned managed identity to trust an external IdP, configure your external software workload to exchange a token from the external IdP for an access token from Microsoft identity platform. The external workload uses the access token to access Microsoft Entra protected resources without needing to manage secrets (in supported scenarios).  To learn more about the token exchange workflow, read about [workload identity federation](workload-identity-federation.md).

In this article, you learn how to create, list, and delete federated identity credentials on a user-assigned managed identity.

- Find the name of the user-assigned managed identity, which you need in the following steps.

## Configure a federated identity credential on a user-assigned managed identity

In the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com), navigate to the user-assigned managed identity you created.  Under **Settings** in the left nav bar, select **Federated credentials** and then **Add Credential**.

In the **Federated credential scenario** dropdown box, select your scenario.

### GitHub Actions deploying Azure resources

To add a federated identity for GitHub actions, follow these steps:

1. For **Entity type**, select **Environment**, **Branch**, **Pull request**, or **Tag** and specify the value. The values must exactly match the configuration in the [GitHub workflow](https://docs.github.com/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#on).  For more info, read the [examples](#entity-type-examples).

1. Add a **Name** for the federated credential.

1. The **Issuer**, **Audiences**, and **Subject identifier** fields autopopulate based on the values you entered.

1. Select **Add** to configure the federated credential.

Use the following values from your Microsoft Entra managed identity for your GitHub workflow:

- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` the managed identity **Client ID**

- `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` the **Subscription ID**.

    The following screenshot demonstrates how to copy the managed identity ID and subscription ID.

    [![Screenshot that demonstrates how to copy the managed identity ID and subscription ID from Azure portal.](./media/workload-identity-federation-create-trust-user-assigned-managed-identity/copy-managed-identity-id.png)](./media/workload-identity-federation-create-trust-user-assigned-managed-identity/copy-managed-identity-id.png#lightbox)

- `AZURE_TENANT_ID` the **Directory (tenant) ID**. Learn [how to find your Microsoft Entra tenant ID](/azure/active-directory-b2c/tenant-management-read-tenant-name).

#### Entity type examples

##### Branch example

For a workflow triggered by a push or pull request event on the main branch:

```yml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
```

Specify an **Entity type** of **Branch** and a **GitHub branch name** of "main".

##### Environment example

For Jobs tied to an environment named "production":

```yml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deployment:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: production
    steps:
      - name: deploy
        # ...deployment-specific steps
```

Specify an **Entity type** of **Environment** and a **GitHub environment name** of "production".

##### Tag example

For example, for a workflow triggered by a push to the tag named "v2":

```yml
on:
  push:
    # Sequence of patterns matched against refs/heads
    branches:
      - main
      - 'mona/octocat'
      - 'releases/**'
    # Sequence of patterns matched against refs/tags
    tags:
      - v2
      - v1.*
```

Specify an **Entity type** of **Tag** and a **GitHub tag name** of "v2".

##### Pull request example

For a workflow triggered by a pull request event, specify an **Entity type** of **Pull request**

### Kubernetes accessing Azure resources

Fill in the **Cluster issuer URL**, **Namespace**, **Service account name**, and **Name** fields:

- **Cluster issuer URL** is the [OIDC issuer URL](/azure/aks/use-oidc-issuer) for the managed cluster or the [OIDC Issuer URL](https://azure.github.io/azure-workload-identity/docs/installation/self-managed-clusters/oidc-issuer.html) for a self-managed cluster.
- **Service account name** is the name of the Kubernetes service account, which provides an identity for processes that run in a Pod.
- **Namespace** is the service account namespace.
- **Name** is the name of the federated credential, which can't be changed later.

Select **Add** to configure the federated credential.

### Other

Select the **Other issuer** scenario from the dropdown menu.

Specify the following fields (using a software workload running in Google Cloud as an example):

- **Name** is the name of the federated credential, which can't be changed later.
- **Subject identifier**: must match the `sub` claim in the token issued by the external identity provider.  In this example using Google Cloud, *subject* is the Unique ID of the service account you plan to use.
- **Issuer**: must match the `iss` claim in the token issued by the external identity provider. A URL that complies with the OIDC Discovery spec. Microsoft Entra ID uses this issuer URL to fetch the keys that are necessary to validate the token. For Google Cloud, the *issuer* is "https://accounts.google.com".

Select **Add** to configure the federated credential.

## List federated identity credentials on a user-assigned managed identity

In the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com), navigate to the user-assigned managed identity you created.  Under **Settings** in the left nav bar and select **Federated credentials**.

The federated identity credentials configured on that user-assigned managed identity are listed.

## Delete a federated identity credential from a user-assigned managed identity

In the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com), navigate to the user-assigned managed identity you created.  Under **Settings** in the left nav bar and select **Federated credentials**.

The federated identity credentials configured on that user-assigned managed identity are listed.

To delete a specific federated identity credential, select the **Delete** icon for that credential.

## Template creation and editing

Resource Manager templates help you deploy new or modified resources defined by an Azure resource group. Several options are available for template editing and deployment, both local and portal-based. You can:

- Use a [custom template from Azure Marketplace](/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/deploy-portal#deploy-resources-from-custom-template) to create a template from scratch or base it on an existing common or [quickstart template](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/).
- Derive from an existing resource group by exporting a template. You can export them from either [the original deployment](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal#export-resource-groups-to-templates) or from the [current state of the deployment](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal#export-resource-groups-to-templates).
- Use a local [JSON editor (such as VS Code)](/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/quickstart-create-templates-use-the-portal), and then upload and deploy by using PowerShell or the Azure CLI.
- Use the Visual Studio [Azure Resource Group project](/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/create-visual-studio-deployment-project) to create and deploy a template.

## Configure a federated identity credential on a user-assigned managed identity

Federated identity credential and parent user assigned identity can be created or updated be means of template below.  You can [deploy ARM templates](/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/quickstart-create-templates-use-the-portal) from the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

All of the template parameters are mandatory.

There's a limit of 3-120 characters for a federated identity credential name length. It must be alphanumeric, dash, underscore. First symbol is alphanumeric only.

You must add exactly one audience to a federated identity credential. The audience is verified during token exchange. Use "api://AzureADTokenExchange" as the default value.

List, Get, and Delete operations aren't available with template. Refer to Azure CLI for these operations.  By default, all child federated identity credentials are created in parallel, which triggers concurrency detection logic and causes the deployment to fail with a 409-conflict HTTP status code. To create them sequentially, specify a chain of dependencies using the *dependsOn* property.

Make sure that any kind of automation creates federated identity credentials under the same parent identity sequentially. Federated identity credentials under different managed identities can be created in parallel without any restrictions.

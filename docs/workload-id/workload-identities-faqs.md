## How many licenses do I need? Do I need to license all workload identities, including Microsoft applications and managed identities? 

Only workload identities eligible for premium features require licensing. License enterprise apps and service principals listed appear in the first category, on the Workload ID landing page, in the Microsoft Entra admin center. To use premium features for a subset of enterprise apps and service principals, procure needed licenses tailored to your requirements. An exception appears if you use [access reviews](~/id-governance/privileged-identity-management/pim-create-roles-and-resource-roles-review.md) for managed identities. Obtain licenses based on the number of managed identities in the graph.

You can use Conditional Access for workload identities for single-tenant applications. [ID Protection](~/id-protection/concept-workload-identity-risk.md) protects single and multitenant applications under Enterprise apps/Service Principals. Microsoft apps and managed identities aren't eligible for Conditional Access and ID Protection. Access reviews are applicable for Service Principals assigned to privileged roles, including managed identities. This feature requires Microsoft Entra ID P2 licenses for reviewers, and Workload ID Premium licenses for access review Service Principles.  

## How do I purchase a Workload ID Premium plan?

You need a current or new Azure or Microsoft 365 subscription. Sign in to the [Microsoft Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/) with your credentials, then buy Workload ID licenses.

## Do the licenses require individual workload identities assignment? 

No, license assignment isn't required. One license in the tenant unlocks all features for all workload identities.

## How can I track licenses assigned to workload identities? 

Unfortunately, we donâ€™t provide a dashboard to track that information. You can track enabled Conditional Access policies targeting workload identities in the **Insights and reporting** area.

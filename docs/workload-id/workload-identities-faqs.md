## How many licenses do I need to purchase? Do I need to license all workload identities including Microsoft applications and managed identities? 

Only the workload identities eligible for premium features require licensing. Specifically, you're required to license enterprise apps and service principals listed under the first category in the following screenshot from the Workload ID landing page in the Microsoft Entra admin center. If you want to utilize premium features for a subset of enterprise apps and service principals, you must procure licenses accordingly, tailored to your specific requirements. An exception arises if you intend to use [access reviews](~/id-governance/privileged-identity-management/pim-create-roles-and-resource-roles-review.md) for managed identities. In such cases, licenses must be obtained based on the number of managed identities depicted in the graph.

Here are more details about which workload identities eligible for specific features. Currently, Conditional Access is applicable for workload identities for single-tenant applications and [ID Protection](~/id-protection/concept-workload-identity-risk.md) protects both single and multitenant applications under Enterprise apps/Service Principals. Microsoft apps and managed identities aren't eligible for Conditional Access and ID Protection. Access reviews are applicable for service principals assigned to privileged roles including managed identities. This feature requires Entra ID P2 licenses for reviewers and Workload ID Premium licenses for service principles that they want to set access reviews for.  

## How do I purchase a Workload ID Premium plan?

You need an Azure or Microsoft 365 subscription. You can use a current subscription or set up a new one. Then, sign into the [Microsoft Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/) with your credentials to buy Workload ID licenses.

## Do these licenses require individual workload identities assignment? 

No, license assignment isn't required.  One license in the tenant unlocks all features for all workload identities.

## How can I track which licenses are assigned to which workload identities? 

Unfortunately, we donâ€™t provide a dashboard to track that information. You can only track enabled Conditional Access policies targeting workload identities in the **Insights and reporting** area. 

:::image type="content" source="media/workload-identities-faqs/insights-and-reportin.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Insights and Reporting in Conditional Access." border="false":::

- Success: Number of service principals where the selected polic(ies) granted access and the required controls were satisfied. 
- Failure: Number of service principals where the selected polic(ies) denied access and the required controls were not satisfied.
- Not applied: Number of service principals that are bypassing the selected polic(ies) because the sign-in did not match at least one of the assignments or conditions.

# Configure an app to trust an external identity provider

This article describes how to manage a federated identity credential on an application in Microsoft Entra ID.  The federated identity credential creates a trust relationship between an application and an external identity provider (IdP).

You can then configure an external software workload to exchange a token from the external IdP for an access token from Microsoft identity platform. The external workload can access Microsoft Entra protected resources without needing to manage secrets (in supported scenarios).  To learn more about the token exchange workflow, read about [workload identity federation](workload-identity-federation.md).

In this article, you learn how to create, list, and delete federated identity credentials on an application in Microsoft Entra ID.

## Important considerations and restrictions

To create, update, or delete a federated identity credential, the account performing the action must have the [Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#application-administrator), [Application Developer](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#application-developer), [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator), or Application Owner role.  The [microsoft.directory/applications/credentials/update permission](~/identity/role-based-access-control/custom-available-permissions.md#microsoftdirectoryapplicationscredentialsupdate) is required to update a federated identity credential.

[!INCLUDE [federated credential configuration](./includes/federated-credential-configuration-considerations.md)]

To learn more about supported regions, time to propagate federated credential updates, supported issuers and more, read [Important considerations and restrictions for federated identity credentials](workload-identity-federation-considerations.md).

## Prerequisites
[Create an app registration](~/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app.md) in Microsoft Entra ID.  Grant your app access to the Azure resources targeted by your external software workload.

Find the object ID of the app (not the application (client) ID), which you need in the following steps.  You can find the object ID of the app in the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com).  Go to the list of app registrations and select your app registration.  In **Overview**->**Essentials**, find the **Object ID**.

Get the *subject* and *issuer* information for your external IdP and software workload, which you need in the following steps.

## Configure a federated identity credential on an app

### GitHub Actions

To add a federated identity for GitHub actions, follow these steps:

1. Find your app registration in the app registrations experience of the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com).  Select **Certificates & secrets** in the left nav pane, select the **Federated credentials** tab, and select **Add credential**.

1. In the **Federated credential scenario** drop-down box, select **GitHub actions deploying Azure resources**.

1. Specify the **Organization** and **Repository** for your GitHub Actions workflow.

1. For **Entity type**, select **Environment**, **Branch**, **Pull request**, or **Tag** and specify the value. The values must exactly match the configuration in the [GitHub workflow](https://docs.github.com/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#on). Pattern matching isn't supported for branches and tags. Specify an environment if your on-push workflow runs against many branches or tags. For more info, read the [examples](#entity-type-examples).

1. Add a **Name** for the federated credential.

1. The **Issuer**, **Audiences**, and **Subject identifier** fields autopopulate based on the values you entered.

1. Select **Add** to configure the federated credential.

    :::image type="content" source="media/workload-identity-federation-create-trust/add-credential.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Add a credential window, showing sample values." :::

Use the following values from your Microsoft Entra application registration for your GitHub workflow:

- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` the **Application (client) ID**

- `AZURE_TENANT_ID` the **Directory (tenant) ID**

    The following screenshot demonstrates how to copy the application ID and tenant ID.

    ![Screenshot that demonstrates how to copy the application ID and tenant ID from Microsoft Entra admin center.](./media/workload-identity-federation-create-trust/copy-client-id.png)

## Configure a federated identity credential on an app

Run the [az ad app federated-credential create](/cli/azure/ad/app/federated-credential) command to create a new federated identity credential on your app.

The `id` parameter specifies the identifier URI, application ID, or object ID of the application. The `parameters` parameter specifies the parameters, in JSON format, for creating the federated identity credential.

### GitHub Actions example

The *name* specifies the name of your federated identity credential.

The *issuer* identifies the path to the GitHub OIDC provider: `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com/`. This issuer will become trusted by your Azure application.

*subject* identifies the GitHub organization, repo, and environment for your GitHub Actions workflow.  When the GitHub Actions workflow requests Microsoft identity platform to exchange a GitHub token for an access token, the values in the federated identity credential are checked against the provided GitHub token. Before Azure will grant an access token, the request must match the conditions defined here.
- For Jobs tied to an environment: `repo:< Organization/Repository >:environment:< Name >`
- For Jobs not tied to an environment, include the ref path for branch/tag based on the ref path used for triggering the workflow: `repo:< Organization/Repository >:ref:< ref path>`.  For example, `repo:n-username/ node_express:ref:refs/heads/my-branch` or `repo:n-username/ node_express:ref:refs/tags/my-tag`.

Run the following method to configure a federated identity credential on an app and create a trust relationship with an external identity provider.  Specify the following parameters (using a software workload running in Google Cloud as an example):

- *name* is the name of the federated credential, which can't be changed later.
- *ObjectID*: the object ID of the app (not the application (client) ID) you previously registered in Microsoft Entra ID.
- *subject*: must match the `sub` claim in the token issued by the external identity provider.  In this example using Google Cloud, *subject* is the Unique ID of the service account you plan to use.
- *issuer*: must match the `iss` claim in the token issued by the external identity provider. A URL that complies with the OIDC Discovery spec. Microsoft Entra ID uses this issuer URL to fetch the keys that are necessary to validate the token. For Google Cloud, the *issuer* is "https://accounts.google.com".
- *audiences* lists the audiences that can appear in the external token.  This field is mandatory.  The recommended value is "api://AzureADTokenExchange".

```azurecli
az rest --method POST --uri 'https://graph.microsoft.com/applications/<ObjectID>/federatedIdentityCredentials' --body '{"name":"GcpFederation","issuer":"https://accounts.google.com","subject":"112633961854638529490","description":"Testing","audiences":["api://AzureADTokenExchange"]}'
```

And you get the response:
```azurecli
{
  "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/$metadata#applications('f6475511-fd81-4965-a00e-41e7792b7b9c')/federatedIdentityCredentials/$entity",
  "audiences": [
    "api://AzureADTokenExchange"
  ],
  "description": "Testing",
  "id": "51ecf9c3-35fc-4519-a28a-8c27c6178bca",
  "issuer": "https://accounts.google.com"",
  "name": "GcpFederation",
  "subject": "112633961854638529490"
}
```

## List federated identity credentials on an app

Run the following method to [list the federated identity credential(s)](/graph/api/application-list-federatedidentitycredentials) for an app (specified by the object ID of the app):

```azurecli
az rest -m GET -u 'https://graph.microsoft.com/applications/f6475511-fd81-4965-a00e-41e7792b7b9c/federatedIdentityCredentials'
```

And you get a response similar to:

```azurecli
{
  "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/$metadata#applications('f6475511-fd81-4965-a00e-41e7792b7b9c')/federatedIdentityCredentials",
  "value": [
    {
      "audiences": [
        "api://AzureADTokenExchange"
      ],
      "description": "Testing",
      "id": "1aa3e6a7-464c-4cd2-88d3-90db98132755",
      "issuer": "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com/",
      "name": "Testing",
      "subject": "repo:octo-org/octo-repo:environment:Production"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Get a federated identity credential on an app

Run the following method to [get a federated identity credential](/graph/api/federatedidentitycredential-get) for an app (specified by the object ID of the app):

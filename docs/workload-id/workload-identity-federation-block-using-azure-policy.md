# Block workload identity federation on managed identities using a policy

This article describes how to block the creation of federated identity credentials on user-assigned managed identities by using Azure Policy. By blocking the creation of federated identity credentials, you can block everyone from using [workload identity federation](workload-identity-federation.md) to access Microsoft Entra protected resources. [Azure Policy](/azure/governance/policy/overview) helps enforce certain business rules on your Azure resources and assess compliance of those resources.

The Not allowed resource types built-in policy can be used to block the creation of federated identity credentials on user-assigned managed identities.

## Create a policy assignment

[!INCLUDE [portal updates](../includes/portal-update.md)]

To create a policy assignment for the Not allowed resource types that blocks the creation of federated identity credentials in a subscription or resource group:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Navigate to **Policy** in the Azure portal.
1. Go to the **Definitions** pane.
1. In the **Search** box, search for "Not allowed resource types" and select the *Not allowed resource types* policy in the list of returned items.

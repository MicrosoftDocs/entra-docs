# Configure identity access controls to meet FedRAMP High Impact level

Access control is a major part of achieving a [Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program](https://www.fedramp.gov/) (FedRAMP) High Impact level to operate.

The following list of controls and control enhancements in the access control (AC) family might require configuration in your Microsoft Entra tenant.

|Control family|Description|
| - | - |
| AC-2| Account management |
| AC-6| Least privilege |
| AC-7| Unsuccessful logon attempts |
| AC-8| System use notification |
| AC-10| Concurrent session control |
| AC-11| Session lock |
| AC-12| Session termination |
| AC-20| Use of external information systems |

Each row in the following table provides prescriptive guidance to help you develop your organization's response to any shared responsibilities for the control or control enhancement.

Users are accessing a U.S. Government information system;<br>(2.) Information system usage may be monitored, recorded, and subject to audit;<br>(3.) Unauthorized use of the information system is prohibited and subject to criminal and civil penalties; and<br>(4.) Use of the information system indicates consent to monitoring and recording;<p><p>**(b.)** Retains the notification message or banner on the screen until users acknowledge the usage conditions and take explicit actions to log on to or further access the information system; and<p><p>**(c.)** For publicly accessible systems:<br>(1.) Displays system use information [*Assignment: organization-defined conditions (FedRAMP Assignment: see additional Requirements and Guidance)*], before granting further access;<br>(2.) Displays references, if any, to monitoring, recording, or auditing that are consistent with privacy accommodations for such systems that generally prohibit those activities; and<br>(3.) Includes a description of the authorized uses of the system.<p><p>**AC-8 Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance:**<br>**Requirement:** The service provider shall determine elements of the cloud environment that require the System Use Notification control.  The elements of the cloud environment that require System Use Notification are approved and accepted by the JAB/AO.<br>**Requirement:** The service provider shall determine how System Use Notification is going to be verified and provide appropriate periodicity of the check.  The System Use Notification verification and periodicity are approved and accepted by the JAB/AO.<br>**Guidance:** If performed as part of a Configuration Baseline check, then the % of items requiring setting that are checked and that pass (or fail) check can be provided.<br>**Requirement:** If not performed as part of a Configuration Baseline check, then there must be documented agreement on how to provide results of verification and the necessary periodicity of the verification by the service provider.  The documented agreement on how to provide verification of the results are approved and accepted by the JAB/AO. | **Display and require user acknowledgment of privacy and security notices before granting access to information systems.**<p>With Microsoft Entra ID, you can deliver notification or banner messages for all apps that require and record acknowledgment before granting access.

| **AC-12 Session Termination**<br>The information system automatically terminates a user session after [*Assignment: organization-defined conditions or trigger events requiring session disconnect*].| **Automatically terminate user sessions when organizational defined conditions or trigger events occur.**<p>Implement automatic user session reevaluation with Microsoft Entra features such as risk-based Conditional Access and continuous access evaluation.

Implement Conditional Access policies to restrict access from external systems. Conditional Access policies might be integrated with Defender for Cloud Apps to provide controls for cloud and on-premises applications from external systems. Mobile application management in Intune can protect organization data at the application level, including custom apps and store apps, from managed devices that interact with external systems. An example would be accessing cloud services. You can use app management on organization-owned devices and personal devices.<P>Terms and conditions<br><li>[Terms of use: Microsoft Entra ID](~/identity/conditional-access/terms-of-use.md)<p>Conditional Access<br><li>[Require device to be marked as compliant](~/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-grant.md)<br><li>[Conditions in Conditional Access policy: Device state (preview)](~/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-conditions.md)<br><li>[Protect with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps Conditional Access App Control](/defender-cloud-apps/proxy-intro-aad)<br><li>[Location condition in Microsoft Entra Conditional Access](~/identity/conditional-access/location-condition.md)<p>MDM<br><li>[What is Microsoft Intune?](/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune)<br><li>[What is Defender for Cloud Apps?](/cloud-app-security/what-is-cloud-app-security)<br><li>[What is app management in Microsoft Intune?](/mem/intune/apps/app-management)<p>Resource<br><li>[Integrate on-premises apps with Defender for Cloud Apps](~/identity/app-proxy/application-proxy-integrate-with-microsoft-cloud-application-security.md) |

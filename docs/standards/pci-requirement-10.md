|-|-|
|**10.3.1** Read access to audit logs files is limited to those with a job-related need.|Privileged users can query logs from Microsoft Entra ID. [Least privileged roles by task in Microsoft Entra ID](~/identity/role-based-access-control/delegate-by-task.md)|
|**10.3.2** Audit log files are protected to prevent modifications by individuals.|In Microsoft Entra ID, you can’t wipe or modify logs. </br> When audit logs are exported to systems such as Azure Log Analytics Workspace, storage accounts, or third-party SIEM systems, monitor them for access.|
|**10.3.3** Audit log files, including those for external-facing technologies, are promptly backed up to a secure, central, internal log server(s) or other media that is difficult to modify.|In Microsoft Entra ID, you can’t wipe or modify logs. </br> When audit logs are exported to systems such as Azure Log Analytics Workspace, storage accounts, or third-party SIEM systems, monitor them for access.|
|**10.3.4** File integrity monitoring or change-detection mechanisms is used on audit logs to ensure that existing log data can't be changed without generating alerts.|In Microsoft Entra ID, you can’t wipe or modify logs. </br> When audit logs are exported to systems such as Azure Log Analytics Workspace, storage accounts, or third-party SIEM systems, monitor them for access.|

## 10.4 Audit logs are reviewed to identify anomalies or suspicious activity.

|PCI-DSS Defined approach requirements|Microsoft Entra guidance and recommendations|
|-|-|
|**10.4.1** The following audit logs are reviewed at least once daily: </br> All security events. </br> Logs of all system components that store, process, or transmit cardholder data (CHD) and/or sensitive authentication data (SAD). Logs of all critical system components. </br> Logs of all servers and system components that perform security functions (for example, network security controls, intrusion-detection systems/intrusion-prevention systems (IDS/IPS), authentication servers).|Include Microsoft Entra logs in this process.|
|**10.4.1.1** Automated mechanisms are used to perform audit log reviews.|Include Microsoft Entra logs in this process. Configure automated actions and alerting when Microsoft Entra logs are integrated with Azure Monitor. [Deploy Azure Monitor: Alerts and automated actions](/azure/azure-monitor/best-practices-alerts)|
|**10.4.2** Logs of all other system components (those not specified in Requirement 10.4.1) are reviewed periodically.|Not applicable to Microsoft Entra ID.|
|**10.4.2.1** The frequency of periodic log reviews for all other system components (not defined in Requirement 10.4.1) is defined in the entity’s targeted risk analysis, which is performed according to all elements specified in Requirement 12.3.1|Not applicable to Microsoft Entra ID.|
|**10.4.3** Exceptions and anomalies identified during the review process are addressed.|Not applicable to Microsoft Entra ID.|

## 10.5 Audit log history is retained and available for analysis.

[Microsoft Entra data retention](~/identity/monitoring-health/reference-reports-data-retention.md)|

## 10.6 Time-synchronization mechanisms support consistent time settings across all systems.

|PCI-DSS Defined approach requirements|Microsoft Entra guidance and recommendations|
|-|-|
|**10.6.1** System clocks and time are synchronized using time-synchronization technology.|Learn about the time synchronization mechanism in Azure services. [Time synchronization for financial services in Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/time-synchronization-for-financial-services-in-azure/)|
|**10.6.2** Systems are configured to the correct and consistent time as follows: </br> One or more designated time servers are in use. </br> Only the designated central time server(s) receives time from external sources. </br> Time received from external sources is based on International Atomic Time or Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). </br> The designated time server(s) accept time updates only from specific industry-accepted external sources. </br> Where there's more than one designated time server, the time servers peer with one another to keep accurate time. </br> Internal systems receive time information only from designated central time server(s).|Learn about the time synchronization mechanism in Azure services. [Time synchronization for financial services in Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/time-synchronization-for-financial-services-in-azure/)|
|**10.6.3** Time synchronization settings and data are protected as follows: </br> Access to time data is restricted to only personnel with a business need. </br> Any changes to time settings on critical systems are logged, monitored, and reviewed.|Microsoft Entra ID relies on time synchronization mechanisms in Azure. </br> Azure procedures synchronize servers and network devices with NTP Stratum 1-time servers synchronized to global positioning system (GPS) satellites. Synchronization occurs every five minutes. Azure ensures service hosts sync time. [Time synchronization for financial services in Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/time-synchronization-for-financial-services-in-azure/) </br> Hybrid components in Microsoft Entra ID, such as Microsoft Entra Connect servers, interact with on-premises infrastructure. The customer owns time synchronization of on-premises servers. |

## 10.7 Failures of critical security control systems are detected, reported, and responded to promptly.

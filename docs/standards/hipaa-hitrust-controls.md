# Microsoft Entra configuration recommendations for HITRUST controls 

This article’s guidance helps you navigate details and provides recommendations of services and features in Microsoft Entra ID to support alignment with HITRUST controls. Use the information to help understand the Health Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST) framework, and support your responsibility of ensuring your organization is compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Assessments involve working with certified HITRUST assessors who are knowledgeable about the framework and are required to help guide you through the process and understand the requirements.

## Health Information Trust Alliance

The HITRUST organization established the Common Security Framework (CSF) to standardize and streamline security and privacy requirements for organizations in the healthcare industry. HITRUST CSF was founded in 2007 to address the complex regulatory environment, security challenges, and privacy concerns that organizations face when handling personal data and protected health information (PHI) data. The CSF consists of 14 control categories comprising 49 control objectives, and 156 control specifics. It was built on the primary principles of International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 27001 and ISO 27002.  

The HITRUST MyCSF tool is available in [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/hitrust1666274640786.hitrust?exp=ubp8&tab=Overview). Use it to manage information security risks, data governance, to comply with information protection regulations, also adhere to national and international standards and best practices. 

> [!NOTE]
> ISO 27001 is a management standard that specifies the requirements for an information security management system (ISMS). ISO 27002 is a set of best practices to select and implement security controls in the ISO 27001 framework.

## HIPAA Security Rule

The [HIPAA Security Rule (HSR)](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/index.html#:~:text=The%20HIPAA%20Security%20Rule%20establishes,maintained%20by%20a%20covered%20entity.) establishes standards to protect an individual’s electronic personal health information created, received, used, or maintained by a Covered Entity (CE), which is a health plan, health care clearinghouse, or healthcare provider. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) manages the HSR. HHS requires administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and security of electronic PHI. 

## HITRUST and HIPAA

HITRUST developed the CSF, which includes security and privacy standards to support healthcare regulations. CSF controls and best practices simplify the task of consolidating sources to ensure compliance with federal legislation, HIPAA security, and privacy rules. HISTRUST CSF is a certifiable security and privacy framework with controls and requirements to demonstrate HIPAA compliance. Healthcare organizations widely adopted the framework. Use the following table to learn about controls.

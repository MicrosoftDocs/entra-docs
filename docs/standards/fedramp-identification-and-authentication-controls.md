# Configure identification and authentication controls to meet FedRAMP High Impact level with Microsoft Entra ID

Identification and authentication are key to achieving a [Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program](https://www.fedramp.gov/) (FedRAMP) High Impact level.

The following list of controls and control enhancements in the identification and authentication (IA) family might require configuration in your Microsoft Entra tenant.

|Control family|Description|
| - | - |
| IA-2| Identification and authentication (organizational users) |
| IA-3| Device identification and authentication |
| IA-4| Identifier management |
| IA-5| Authenticator management |
| IA-6| Authenticator feedback |
| IA-7| Cryptographic module authentication |
| IA-8| Identification and authentication (nonorganizational users) |

Each row in the following table provides prescriptive guidance to help you develop your organization's response to any shared responsibilities for the control or control enhancement.

Configure the federated domain in Microsoft Entra ID with setting **federatedIdpMfaBehavior** to `enforceMfaByFederatedIdp` (recommended) or SupportsMfa to `$True` to direct multifactor authentication requests originating at Microsoft Entra ID to Active Directory Federation Services. Alternatively, you can use PIV for sign-in on Windows devices and later use integrated Windows authentication along with seamless single sign-on.

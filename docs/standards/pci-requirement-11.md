## Next steps

PCI-DSS requirements **3**, **4**, **9**, and **12** aren't applicable to Microsoft Entra ID, therefore there are no corresponding articles. To see all requirements, go to pcisecuritystandards.org: [Official PCI Security Standards Council Site](https://docs-prv.pcisecuritystandards.org/PCI%20DSS/Standard/PCI-DSS-v4_0.pdf).

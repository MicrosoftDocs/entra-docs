# Configure CMMC Level 2 Access Control (AC) controls

Microsoft Entra ID can help you meet identity-related practice requirements in each Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) level. To be compliant with requirements in [CMMC V2.0 level 2](https://dodcio.defense.gov/CMMC/Model/), it's the responsibility of companies performing work with, and on behalf of, the US Dept. of Defense (DoD) to complete other configurations or processes.

In CMMC Level 2, there are 13 domains that have one or more practices related to identity:

* Access Control (AC)
* Audit & Accountability (AU)
* Configuration Management (CM)
* Identification & Authentication (IA)
* Incident Response (IR)
* Maintenance (MA)
* Media Protection (MP)
* Personnel Security (PS)
* Physical Protection (PE)
* Risk Assessment (RA)
* Security Assessment (CA)
* System and Communications Protection (SC)
* System and Information Integrity (SI)

The remainder of this article provides guidance for the Access Control (AC) domain. There's a table with links to content that provides step-by-step guidance to accomplish the practice.

## Access Control (AC)

The following table provides a list of practice statement and objectives, and Microsoft Entra guidance and recommendations to enable you to meet these requirements with Microsoft Entra ID.

| AC.L2-3.1.3<br><br>**Practice statement:** Control the flow of CUI in accordance with approved authorizations.<br><br>**Objectives:**<br>Determine if:<br>[a.] information flow control policies are defined;<br>[b.] methods and enforcement mechanisms for controlling the flow of CUI are defined;<br>[c.] designated sources and destinations (for example, networks, individuals, and devices) for CUI within the system and between intercfeetonnected systems are identified;<br>[d.] authorizations for controlling the flow of CUI are defined; and<br>[e.] approved authorizations for controlling the flow of CUI are enforced. | Configure Conditional Access policies to control the flow of CUI from trusted locations, trusted devices, approved applications and require app protection policy. For finer grained authorization to CUI, configure app-enforced restrictions(Exchange/SharePoint Online), App Control (with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps), Authentication Context.

Configure Entitlement Management Access packages to govern access to applications, groups, Teams and SharePoint sites. Configure Separation of Duties checks within access packages to avoid a user obtaining excessive access. In Microsoft Entra entitlement management, you can configure multiple policies, with different settings for each user community that will need access through an access package. This configuration includes restrictions such that a user of a particular group, or already assigned a different access package, isn't assigned other access packages, by policy.<br><br>Configure administrative units in Microsoft Entra ID to scope administrative privilege so that administrators with privileged roles are scoped to only have those privileges on limited set of directory objects(users, groups, devices).<br>[What is entitlement management?](~/id-governance/entitlement-management-overview.md)<br>[What are access packages and what resources can I manage with them?](~/id-governance/entitlement-management-overview.md)<br>[Configure separation of duties for an access package in Microsoft Entra entitlement management](~/id-governance/entitlement-management-access-package-incompatible.md)<br>[Administrative units in Microsoft Entra ID](~/identity/role-based-access-control/administrative-units.md)|

# Configure Microsoft Entra ID to meet CMMC Level 2

Microsoft Entra ID helps meet identity-related practice requirements in each Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) level. To be compliant with requirements in CMMC V2.0 level 2, it's the responsibility of companies performing work with, and on behalf of, the US Dept. of Defense (DoD) to complete other configurations or processes.

In CMMC Level 2, there are 13 domains that have one or more practices related to identity:

* Access Control (AC)
* Audit & Accountability (AU)
* Configuration Management (CM)
* Identification & Authentication (IA)
* Incident Response (IR)
* Maintenance (MA)
* Media Protection (MP)
* Personnel Security (PS)
* Physical Protection (PE)
* Risk Assessment (RA)
* Security Assessment (CA)
* System and Communications Protection (SC)
* System and Information Integrity (SI)

The remainder of this article provides guidance for all of the domains except Access Control (AC) and Identification and Authentication (IA) which are covered in other articles. For each domain, there's a table with links to content that provides step-by-step guidance to accomplish the practice.

## Audit & Accountability

The following table provides a list of practice statement and objectives, and Microsoft Entra guidance and recommendations to enable you to meet these requirements with Microsoft Entra ID.

| CMMC practice statement and objectives | Microsoft Entra guidance and recommendations |

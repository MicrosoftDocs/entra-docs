## Install Microsoft Authenticator on your mobile device

If you already have Microsoft Authenticator installed, you can skip this section. If you need to install it, follow these instructions, but make sure you install **Microsoft Authenticator** and not another app with the name Authenticator, as there are multiple apps sharing that name. Once you have installed it, update to the latest version when new versions are available.

- On iPhone, open the [App Store](https://support.apple.com/HT204266) app and search for **Microsoft Authenticator** and install the app.

- On Android, open the [Google Play](https://play.google.com/about/howplayworks/) app and search for **Microsoft Authenticator** and install the app.

1. Open the Authenticator app and press **Accept** on the first screen.

## Issue a verifiable credential

When the Microsoft Authenticator app is installed and ready, you use the public end to end demo webapp to issue your first verifiable credential onto the Authenticator.

1. Open [end to end demo](https://woodgroveemployee.azurewebsites.net/) in your browser
    1. Enter your First Name and Last Name and press **Next**
    1. Select **Verify with True Identity**
    1. Click **Take a selfie** and **Upload government issued ID**. The demo uses simulated data and you don't need to provide a real selfie or an ID. 
    1. Click **Next** and **OK**
2. Open your Microsoft Authenticator app
3. Select **Verified IDs** in the lower right corner on the start screen
4. Select **Scan QR code** button. This screen only shows if you have no verifiable credential cards in the app.

    :::image type="content" source="media/using-authenticator/scan-qr-code-screen.png" alt-text="Screenshot of scan qr code screen.":::

5. If this is the first time you scan a QR code, the mobile device notifies you that the Authenticator is trying to access the camera. Select **OK** to continue scanning the QR code.

    :::image type="content" source="media/using-authenticator/access-camera-screen.png" alt-text="Screenshot of access camera screen.":::

6. Scan the QR code and enter the pin code in the Authenticator and select **Next**. The pin code is shown in the browser page.

    :::image type="content" source="media/using-authenticator/add-card-screen.png" alt-text="Screenshot of add VC card screen.":::

8. Select **Return to Woodgrove** in the browser

Note the following.

- After you've scanned the QR code, the Authenticator displays who the issuing party is for the verifiable credential. In the above screenshots, you can see that it's **True Identity** and that the issuance request comes from a verified domain **did.woodgrovedemo.com**. As a user, it is your choice if you trust this issuing party.
- Not all issuance requests involve a pin code. It's up to the issuing party to decide to include the use of a pin code.
- The purpose of using a pin code is to add an extra level of security of the issuance process so only you, the intended recipient, can issue the verifiable credential.
- The demo displays the pin code in the browser page next to the QR code. In a real world scenario, the pin code wouldn't be displayed there, but instead be given to you in some alternate way, like in an email or an SMS text message.

## Present a verifiable credential

In learning how to present a verifiable credential, you continue where you left off above. Here, you'll present the True Identity verifiable credential to the demo webapp. Make sure you have a **True Identity** verifiable credential in the Authenticator before continuing.

1. If you're continuing where you left off, select **Access personalized portal** in the end to end demo webapp. If you have the True Identity verifiable credential in the Authenticator but closed the browser, then first select **I've been verified** in the [end to end](https://woodgroveemployee.azurewebsites.net/verification) demo webapp and then select **Access personalized portal**. Selecting  **Access personalized portal** will present a QR code in the webpage.
2. Open your Microsoft Authenticator app
3. Select **Verified IDs** in the lower right corner on the start screen
4. Press the **QR code symbol** in the top right corner to turn on the camera and scan the QR code.
5. Select **Share** in the Authenticator to present the verifiable credential to the end to end demo webapp.

    :::image type="content" source="media/using-authenticator/share-card-screen.png" alt-text="Screenshot of sharing a VC card screen.":::

6. In the browser, click the  **Continue onboarding** button

Note the following.

- After you've scanned the QR code, the Authenticator will display who the verifying party is for the verifiable credential. In the above screenshots, you can see that it is **True Identity** and that the issuance request comes from a verified domain **did.woodgrovedemo.com**. As a user, it is your choice if you trust this party and want to share your credential with them.
- If the presentation request does not match any of the verifiable credentials you have in the Authenticator, you get a message that you haven't the credentials requested.
- If the presentation request matches multiple verifiable credentials you have in the Authenticator, you are asked to pick the one you want to share.
- If you have an expired verifiable credential that matches the presentation request, you get a message that it's expired and you can't share the credentials requested.

## View activity details of when and where you have presented your verifiable credentials

The Microsoft Authenticator keeps records of the activity for your verifiable credentials.
If you select a credential card and then switch to view **Activity**, you see the activity list for your credential sorted in most recently used order. For your True Identity card, you see two entries, where the first is when it was issued and the second that the credential was shared with Woodgrove.

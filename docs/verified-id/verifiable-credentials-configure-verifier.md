# Configure Microsoft Entra Verified ID verifier

  
In [Issue Microsoft Entra Verified ID credentials from an application](verifiable-credentials-configure-issuer.md), you learn how to issue and verify credentials by using the same Microsoft Entra tenant. In a real-world scenario, where the issuer and verifier are separate organizations, the verifier uses *their own* Microsoft Entra tenant to perform the verification of the credential that was issued by the other organization. In this tutorial, you go over the steps needed to present and verify your first verifiable credential: a verified credential expert card.

As a verifier, you unlock privileges to subjects that possess verified credential expert cards. In this tutorial, you run a sample application from your local computer that asks you to present a verified credential expert card, and then verifies it.

In this article, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - Download the sample application code to your local computer
> - Set up Microsoft Entra Verified ID on your Microsoft Entra tenant
> - Gather credentials and environment details to set up your sample application, and update the sample application with your verified credential expert card details
> - Run the sample application and initiate a verifiable credential issuance process

## Prerequisites

- [Set up a tenant for Microsoft Entra Verified ID](verifiable-credentials-configure-tenant.md).
- If you want to clone the repository that hosts the sample app, install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download), [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) or similar code editor.
- [.NET 7.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0).
- Download [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) and sign up for a free account. If you can't use `ngrok` in your organization, read this [FAQ](verifiable-credentials-faq.md#i-cannot-use-ngrok-what-do-i-do).
- A mobile device with the latest version of Microsoft Authenticator.

## Gather tenant details to set up your sample application

Now that you've set up your Microsoft Entra Verified ID service, you're going to gather some information about your environment and the verifiable credentials you set. You use these pieces of information when you set up your sample application.

1. From **Verified ID**, select **Organization settings**.
1. Copy the **Tenant identifier** value, and record it for later.
1. Copy the **Decentralized identifier** value, and record it for later.

The following screenshot demonstrates how to copy the required values:

:::image type="content" source="media/verifiable-credentials-configure-verifier/tenant-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot that demonstrates how to copy the required values from Microsoft Entra Verified ID.":::

## Download the sample code

The sample application is available in .NET, and the code is maintained in a GitHub repository. Download the sample code from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-verifiable-credentials-dotnet), or clone the repository to your local computer:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Azure-Samples/active-directory-verifiable-credentials-dotnet.git 
```

## Configure the verifiable credentials app

Create a client secret for the registered application you created. The sample application uses the client secret to prove its identity when it requests tokens.

1. In Microsoft Entra ID, go to **App registrations**.

1. Select the **verifiable-credentials-app** application you created earlier.

1. Select the name to go into the **App registrations details**.

1. Copy the **Application (client) ID** value, and store it for later. 

    :::image type="content" source="media/verifiable-credentials-configure-verifier/get-app-id.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to get the app ID.":::

1. In **App registration details**, from the main menu, under **Manage**, select **Certificates & secrets**.

1. Select **New client secret**.

    1. In the **Description** box, enter a description for the client secret (for example, vc-sample-secret).

    1. Under **Expires**, select a duration for which the secret is valid (for example, six months). Then select **Add**.

    1. Record the secret's **Value**. This value is needed in a later step. The secretâ€™s value won't be displayed again, and isn't retrievable by **any** other means, so you should record it once it's visible.

At this point, you should have all the required information that you need to set up your sample application.

## Update the sample application

Now make modifications to the sample app's issuer code to update it with your verifiable credential URL. This step allows you to issue verifiable credentials by using your own tenant.

1. In the *active-directory-verifiable-credentials-dotnet-main* directory, open **Visual Studio Code**. Select the project inside the *1. asp-net-core-api-idtokenhint* directory.

1. Under the project root folder, open the *appsettings.json* file. This file contains information about your credentials in Microsoft Entra Verified ID environment. Update the following properties with the information that you collected during earlier steps.

    1. **Tenant ID**: Your tenant ID
    1. **Client ID**: Your client ID
    1. **Client Secret**: Your client secret
    1. **DidAuthority**: Your decentralized identifier
    1. **CredentialType**: Your credential type

    CredentialManifest is only needed for issuance, so if all you want to do is presentation, it strictly isn't needed.

1. Save the *appsettings.json* file.

The following JSON demonstrates a complete *appsettings.json* file:

```json
{
  "VerifiedID": {
    "Endpoint": "https://verifiedid.did.msidentity.com/v1.0/verifiableCredentials/",
    "VCServiceScope": "3db474b9-6a0c-4840-96ac-1fceb342124f/.default",
    "Instance": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/",
    "TenantId": "12345678-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
    "ClientId": "33333333-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
    "ClientSecret": "123456789012345678901234567890",
    "CertificateName": "[Or instead of client secret: Enter here the name of a certificate (from the user cert store) as registered with your application]",
    "DidAuthority": "did:web:...your-decentralized-identifier...",
    "CredentialType": "VerifiedCredentialExpert",
    "CredentialManifest":  "https://verifiedid.did.msidentity.com/v1.0/12345678-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/verifiableCredentials/contracts/VerifiedCredentialExpert"
  }
}
```

## Run and test the sample app

Now you are ready to present and verify your first verified credential expert card by running the sample application.

1. From Visual Studio Code, run the *Verifiable_credentials_DotNet* project. Or from the command shell, run the following commands:

    ```bash
    cd active-directory-verifiable-credentials-dotnet\1-asp-net-core-api-idtokenhint
    dotnet build "AspNetCoreVerifiableCredentials.csproj" -c Debug -o .\bin\Debug\net6
    dotnet run
    ```

1. In another terminal, run the following command. This command runs the [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to set up a URL on 5000 and make it publicly available on the internet.

    ```bash
    ngrok http 5000 
    ```
    
    >[!NOTE]
    > On some computers, you might need to run the command in this format: `./ngrok http 5000`.

1. Open the HTTPS URL generated by ngrok.

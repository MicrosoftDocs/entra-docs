# Customer intent: As a developer, I want to learn how to create a developer Microsoft Entra account so I can participate in the preview with a P2 license.

## Create a Microsoft Entra tenant for development

 With a free Microsoft Entra account, you can onboard the verifiable credential service and test issuing and verifying verifiable credentials. Create a free account in either of two ways:

- [Join the free Microsoft 365 Developer Program](https://aka.ms/o365devprogram), and get a free sandbox, tools, and other resources (for example, a Microsoft Entra account with P2 licenses, configured users, groups, and mailboxes).
- [Create a new tenant](~/identity-platform/quickstart-create-new-tenant.md) and [activate a free trial of Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2](https://azure.microsoft.com/trial/get-started-active-directory/) in your new tenant.

If you decide to sign up for the free Microsoft 365 developer program, you need to follow a few easy steps:

1. On the [Join the free Microsoft 365 Developer Program](https://aka.ms/o365devprogram) page, select **Join now**.

1. Sign in with a new Microsoft account or use an existing (work) account.

1. On the sign-up page, select your region, enter a company name, and accept the terms and conditions of the program.

1. Select **Next**.

1. Select **Set up subscription**. Specify the region where you want to create your new tenant, create a username, domain, and enter a password. This creates a new tenant and the first administrator of the tenant.

1. Enter the security information needed to protect the administrator account of your new tenant. This sets up multifactor authentication for the account.


At this point, you've created a tenant with 25 E5 user licenses. The E5 licenses include Microsoft Entra ID P2 licenses. Optionally, you can add sample data packs with users, groups, mail, and SharePoint to help you test in your development environment. For the verifiable credential issuing service, they're not required.

For your convenience, you could add your own work account as [guest](~/external-id/b2b-quickstart-add-guest-users-portal.md) in the newly created tenant and use that account to administer the tenant. If you want the guest account to be able to manage the verifiable credential service, you need to assign the *Global Administrator* role to that user.

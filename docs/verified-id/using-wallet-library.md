# Using the Microsoft Entra Wallet Library with Verified ID

In this tutorial, you learn how a mobile app can use the Microsoft Entra Wallet Library with Verified ID to issue and present verifiable credentials.

## Prerequisites

- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) installed on Mac/Windows and an Android test device. You need to enable [developer mode](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options) on your Android test device.
- An [Apple developer account](https://developer.apple.com/), Mac with [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and an iOS test device with [developer mode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/enabling-developer-mode-on-a-device) enabled. The iOS version needs to be 16 and above.
- Install the [QR Code Reader](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/qr-code-reader/id1200318119) app on your test device. The WalletLibraryDemo app doesn't come with the ability to scan QR codes, so you need the QR Code Reader app to scan the QR codes with.

You don't need to be a mobile developer to follow this tutorial and get the demo app up and running. The tools and a test device and the courage to try is all you need. You also don't need a Microsoft Entra Verified ID tenant onboarded as you can test the demo app with our public end to end demo website.

> [!NOTE]
> Use the latest Wallet Library available to get support for NIST compliant P-256 curve used by Verified ID since February 2024.

## What is the Microsoft Entra Wallet Library?

The Microsoft Entra Wallet Library for iOS and Android gives your mobile app the ability to begin using the Microsoft Entra Verified ID platform. Using the Wallet Library, your mobile app can issue and present verifiable credentials in accordance with industry standards.

## When should I use the Microsoft Entra Wallet Library?

Microsoft Authenticator has all the functionality to act as the wallet for Microsoft Entra Verified ID. But in cases where you can’t use the Microsoft Authenticator, the Wallet Library is your alternative. An example could be when you already have a mobile app that your users are familiar with and where it makes more sense to include verifiable credentials technology into this app.

You can use the Microsoft Authenticator and a mobile app using the Wallet Library side-by-side on the same mobile device. The Authenticator, if installed, will be the app that has registered the protocol handler for openid://, so your app needs to make sure that the issuance and presentation requests find your app. Use of embedded deep links in HTML-pages that relies on the openid:// protocol will result in the Microsoft Authenticator being launched.

## Does Microsoft use the Microsoft Entra Wallet Library?

Yes, the Wallet Library is used by the Microsoft Authenticator. Some features may appear in the Authenticator first, but it is our ambition to make them available in the Wallet Library.

## What is the effort of adding the Microsoft Entra Wallet Library to my app?

You add the Wallet Library to your mobile app project via adding a maven dependency for Android and adding a cocoapod dependency for iOS.

### [iOS](#tab/ios)

For iOS, add the WalletLibrary pod to your Podfile.

```Swift
target "YourApp" do
  use_frameworks!
  pod "WalletLibrary", "~> 1.0.1"
end
```

### [Android](#tab/android)
For Android, add to your app's build.gradle to add Wallet Library as a dependency.

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.microsoft.entra.verifiedid:walletlibrary:1.0.1'
}
```

---

Then you need to add some code to process the requests. For details, please see the WalletLibraryDemo sample code.

### [iOS](#tab/ios)

```swift
/// Create a verifiedIdClient.
let verifiedIdClient = VerifiedIdClientBuilder().build()

/// Create a VerifiedIdRequestInput using a OpenId Request Uri.
let input = VerifiedIdRequestURL(url: URL(string: "openid-vc://...")!)
let result = await verifiedIdClient.createRequest(from: input)

/// Every external method's return value is wrapped in a Result object to ensure proper error handling.
switch (result) {
case .success(let request):
    /// A request created from the method above could be an issuance or a presentation request. 
    /// In this example, it is a presentation request, so we can cast it to a VerifiedIdPresentationRequest.
    let presentationRequest = request as? VerifiedIdPresentationRequest
case .failure(let error):
    /// If an error occurs, its value can be accessed here.
    print(error)
}
```

### [Android](#tab/android)

```kotlin
// Create a verifiedIdClient
val verifiedIdClient = VerifiedIdClientBuilder(context).build()

// Create a VerifiedIdRequestInput using a OpenId Request Uri.
val verifiedIdRequestUrl = VerifiedIdRequestURL(Uri.parse("openid-vc://..."))
val verifiedIdRequestResult: Result<VerifiedIdRequest<*>> = verifiedIdClient.createRequest(verifiedIdRequestUrl)

// Every external method's return value is wrapped in a Result object to ensure proper error handling.
if (verifiedIdRequestResult.isSuccess) {
    val verifiedIdRequest = verifiedIdRequestResult.getOrNull()
    val presentationRequest = verifiedIdRequest?.let {
        verifiedIdRequest as VerifiedIdPresentationRequest
    }
} else {
    // If an exception occurs, its value can be accessed here.
    val exception = verifiedIdRequestResult.exceptionOrNull()
}
```

Then, you have to handle the following major tasks in your app.

- Getting the request URLs. The Wallet Library doesn't come with any functionality to scan a QR code or similar. Obtaining the request URL via methods like scanning a QR code must be added by you. 
- Storing the credentials. The Wallet Library creates the private and public key used for signing responses and stores this on the device, but it doesn't come with any functionality for storing credentials. You have to manage credential storage for your mobile app.
- User Interface. Any visual representation of stored credentials and the UI for driving the issuance and presentation process must be implemented by you.

## Wallet Library Demo app

The Wallet Library comes with a demo app in the GitHub repo that is ready to use without any modifications. You just have to build and deploy it. The demo app is a lightweight and simple implementation that illustrates issuance and presentation at its minimum. To quickly get going, you can use the QR Code Reader app to scan the QR code, and then copy and paste it into the demo app.

In order to test the demo app, you need a webapp that issues credentials and makes presentation requests for credentials. The [Woodgrove public demo webapp](https://aka.ms/vcdemo) is used for this purpose in this tutorial.

## Building the Android sample

On your developer machine with Android Studio, do the following:

1. Download or clone the Android Wallet Library [GitHub repo](https://github.com/microsoft/entra-verifiedid-wallet-library-android/tree/dev). You don’t need the walletlibrary folder and you can delete it if you like.
1. Start Android Studio and open the parent folder of walletlibrarydemo

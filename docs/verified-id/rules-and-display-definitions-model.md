# Rules and Display Definition Reference

  
Rules and Display definitions are used to define a credential. You can read more about it in [How to customize your credentials](credential-design.md).

## rulesModel type

| Property | Type | Description |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| `attestations`| [idTokenAttestation](#idtokenattestation-type) and/or [idTokenHintAttestation](#idtokenhintattestation-type) and/or [verifiablePresentationAttestation](#verifiablepresentationattestation-type) and/or [selfIssuedAttestation](#selfissuedattestation-type) | defines the attestation flow(s) to be used for gathering claims to issue in the verifiable credential. |
| `validityInterval` | number | represents the lifespan of the credential in seconds |
| `vc`| [vcType](#vctype-type) | verifiable credential types for this contract |

The attestation type example in JSON. Notice that `selfIssued` is a single instance while the others are collections. For examples of how to use the attestation type, see [Sample JSON rules definitions](how-to-use-quickstart-multiple.md#sample-json-rules-definitions) in the How-to guides.
 
```json
"attestations": {
  "idTokens": [],
  "idTokenHints": [],
  "presentations": [],
  "selfIssued": {}
}
```

### idTokenAttestation type

When you sign in the user from within Authenticator, you can use the returned ID token from the OpenID Connect compatible provider as input.

| Property | Type | Description |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| `mapping` | [claimMapping](#claimmapping-type) (optional) | rules to map input claims into output claims in the verifiable credential |
| `configuration` | string (url) | location of the identity provider's configuration document |
| `clientId` | string | client ID to use when obtaining the ID token |
| `redirectUri` | string | redirect uri to use when obtaining the ID token; MUST BE `vcclient://openid/` |
| `scope` | string | space delimited list of scopes to use when obtaining the ID token |
| `required` | boolean (default false) | indicating whether this attestation is required or not |
| `trustedIssuers` | optional string (array) | a list of DIDs allowed to issue the verifiable credential for this contract. This property is only used for specific scenarios where the `id_token_hint` can come from another issuer |

### idTokenHintAttestation type

This flow uses the ID Token Hint, which is provided as payload through the Request REST API. The mapping is the same as for the ID Token attestation.

| Property | Type | Description |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| `mapping` | [claimMapping](#claimmapping-type) (optional) | rules to map input claims into output claims in the verifiable credential |
| `required` | boolean (default false) | indicating whether this attestation is required or not. [Request Service API](presentation-request-api.md#http-request) will fail the call if required claims are not set in the createPresentationRequest payload. |
| `trustedIssuers` | optional string (array) | a list of DIDs allowed to issue the verifiable credential for this contract. This property is only used for specific scenarios where the `id_token_hint` can come from another issuer |

### verifiablePresentationAttestation type

When you want the user to present another verifiable credential as input for a new issued verifiable credential. The wallet allows the user to select the verifiable credential during issuance.

| Property | Type | Description |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| `mapping` | [claimMapping](#claimmapping-type) (optional) | rules to map input claims into output claims in the verifiable credential |
| `credentialType` | string (optional) | required credential type of the input |
| `required` | boolean (default false) | indicating whether this attestation is required or not |
| `trustedIssuers` | string (array) | a list of DIDs allowed to issue the verifiable credential for this contract. The service defaults to your issuer under the covers so no need to provide this value yourself. |

### selfIssuedAttestation type

When you want the user to enter information themselves. This type is also called self-attested input.

| Property | Type | Description |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| `mapping` | [claimMapping](#claimmapping-type) (optional) | rules to map input claims into output claims in the verifiable credential |
| `required` | boolean (default false) | indicating whether this attestation is required or not |


### claimMapping type

| Property | Type | Description |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| `inputClaim` | string | the name of the claim to use from the input |
| `outputClaim` | string | the name of the claim in the verifiable credential |
| `indexed` | boolean (default false) | indicating whether the value of this claim is used for searching; only one clientMapping object is indexable for a given contract |
| `required` | boolean (default false) | indicating whether this mapping is required or not |
| `type` | string (optional) | type of claim |

### vcType type

| Property | Type | Description |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| `type` | string (array) | a list of verifiable credential types this contract can issue |

## Example rules definition:
```
{
  "attestations": {
    "idTokenHints": [
      {
        "mapping": [
          {

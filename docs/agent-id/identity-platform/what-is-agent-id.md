# What are agent IDs?

Agent IDs are first-class accounts within Microsoft Entra ID that provide unique identification and authentication capabilities for AI agents. Agent IDs enable scalable deployment of autonomous AI systems that function securely in your enterprise. They help to address certain security challenges posed by AI agents, such as:

- The need to distinguish operations performed by AI agents from operations performed by workforce, customer, or workload identities.
- Enabling AI agents to gain right-sized access across systems.
- Preventing AI agents from gaining access to the most critical security roles and systems.
- Scaling identity management to large numbers of AI agents that might be quickly created and destroyed.

This article provides a basic overview of this new identity, and introduces key concepts necessary for deploying and securing AI agents.

## Anatomy of an agent ID

An account used by an AI agent is referred to as an **agent identity**. Much like your typical user account, an agent identity has a few key components:

- **Identifier**. Each agent identity has an `id` (also known as object ID), such as `aaaaaaaa-1111-2222-3333-bbbbbbbbbb`. The `id` is generated by Microsoft Entra and uniquely identifies the account within a Microsoft Entra tenant.

- **Credentials**. Agent identities don't have passwords, but have other forms of credentials they can use to authenticate. See the following sections for more details.

- **Display name**. An agent identity's display name is surfaced in many experiences such as the Microsoft Entra admin center, Azure portal, Teams, Outlook, and more. It's the human-friendly name of an agent and can be changed.

- **Sponsor**. Agent identities can have a sponsor, which records the human user or group that's accountable for an agent. This sponsor is used for various purposes, such as contacting a human in case a security incident happens.

- **Blueprint**. All agent identities are created from a reusable template called an agent identity blueprint. The agent identity blueprint establishes the kind of agent and records metadata shared across all agent identities of a common kind.

- **Agent user (optional)**. Some agents need access to systems that strictly require a Microsoft Entra user account be used for authentication. In these cases, an agent can be given a second account, called an **agent user**. This second account is a user account in the Microsoft Entra tenant that is decorated as an AI agent. It has a different `id` than the agent identity, but a 1:1 relationship is always established between an agent identity and its agent user.

These are the basic components of an agent identity that enable secure authentication and authorization. The full object schema of an agent identity is available in Microsoft Graph reference documentation.

## Features: What can agent IDs do?

Like other accounts, agent IDs are primarily a means to access apps, web services, and other systems in your organization. An AI agent can use agent IDs to:

- **Access web services**. Agents can request access tokens from Microsoft Entra, and use those tokens to access web services. Services can include Microsoft services such as Microsoft Graph, services built by your organization, and services purchased from third-party vendors.

- **Autonomous access**. Agents can act autonomously, using access rights given directly to the agent identity. Access rights can include Microsoft Graph permissions, Azure RBAC roles, Microsoft Entra directory roles, Microsoft Entra app roles, and more.

- **Delegated access**. Agents can act on behalf of human users, using access rights given to the user. The user has control over which rights are delegated to the agent identity.

- **Authenticate incoming messages**: Agents can accept requests from other clients, users, and agents. Those requests can be secured using access tokens issued by Microsoft Entra ID, allowing the agent to reliably identify the caller and make authorization decisions.

- **Sign in to apps and sites (future)**: In the future, agents are able to sign-in to websites and installed clients that depend on Microsoft Entra ID for single sign-on. This feature enables agents to utilize the same tools and systems as humans to accomplish tasks.

## Examples: Agent identities in use today

Several Microsoft products already use agent IDs for authenticating AI agents. Two examples include:

- [**Entra Conditional Access optimization agent**](~/identity/conditional-access/agent-optimization.md): When this agent is enabled in your tenant, it's given an agent identity. The Microsoft Entra Conditional Access optimization agent then uses its agent identity to query Microsoft Entra systems and inspect the tenant's configuration. All queries made by the agent are recorded as having been performed by an AI agent. The agent's activity is subject to any security policies enforced for agent identities. You can view the agent's identity in the Microsoft Entra admin center in the **Agent identities** tab.

- [**Agents built in Copilot Studio**](https://todo): In organizations that use Copilot Studio, users can quickly create AI agents using Copilot Studio's low-code tools. Each time an AI agent is created, the agent gets an agent identity in the Microsoft Entra tenant. The user who created the agent is recorded as its sponsor. The agent can then use its agent identity to send/receive chat messages to users, and connect to various systems like SharePoint or Dataverse. Any authentication performed by these agents is logged in Microsoft Entra ID as AI agents and viewable through the Microsoft Entra admin center.

## Blueprints: Consistent security for agent identities

A key characteristic of agent IDs is that all agent identities are created from a reusable template called an agent identity blueprint. The blueprint establishes the "kind" of agent and records metadata shared across all agent identities of a common kind.

Imagine that an organization uses an AI agent called a "Sales Assistant Agent." Whether the agent is purchased or built in-house, an agent identity blueprint would be added to the organization's Microsoft Entra tenant. The blueprint captures the following information:

- The name of the blueprint, such as "Sales Assistant Agent"
- The organization who published the blueprint, such as "Contoso"
- Any roles the agent might offer, such as "sales manager" or "sales rep"
- Any Microsoft Graph permissions that its agents are granted, such as "read the signed in user's calendar"

Many sales teams within the organization deploy the AI agent. An agent is deployed for North America sales. Another is deployed for South America sales. One for enterprise sales, one for small/medium businesses, and another for startups. Upon creation, each of these agents is given an agent identity. Each agent begins running and performing tasks using its agent identity for authentication.

Because each agent identity is created using the same agent ID blueprint, all agents appear as "Sales Assistant Agents" in the Microsoft Entra admin center. This feature allows the Microsoft Entra administrator to take actions like:

- Apply a conditional access policy to all Sales Assistant Agents.
- Disable all Sales Assistant agents.
- Revoke a permission grant for all Sales Assistant agents.

Agent ID blueprints give the Microsoft Entra administrator the ability to secure agent identities at scale by setting rules and performing operations based on the kind of agent. This feature ensures consistent security for each AI agent that is deployed in the organization.

## Credentials for agent identities

Unlike human users, AI agents don't use passwords, SMS, passkeys, or authenticator apps for authentication. Instead, agent identities use credentials types that are usable by software systems. These credential types include:

- managed identities, for AI agents that run on Azure (most secure).
- federated identity credentials, for AI agents that run on Kubernetes or other cloud providers.
- certificates / cryptographic keys.
- client secrets.

The kinds of credentials allowed for use by agent IDs in a tenant can be controlled via app management policies.

In Microsoft Entra agent ID, each agent identity doesn't have its own credentials. Instead, all credentials are configured on the agent identity blueprint. All agent identities created using the agent ID blueprint share its credentials. This relationship prevents implementers from needing to store and protect hundreds to thousands of credentials (one for each agent identity). For details, refer to the agent ID authentication protocol reference.

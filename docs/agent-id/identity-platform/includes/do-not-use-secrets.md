> Client secrets shouldn't be used as client credentials in production environments for agent identity blueprints due to security risks. Instead, use more secure authentication methods such as [federated identity credentials (FIC) with managed identities](/entra/workload-id/workload-identity-federation-config-app-trust-managed-identity) or client certificates. These methods provide enhanced security by eliminating the need to store sensitive secrets directly within your application configuration.

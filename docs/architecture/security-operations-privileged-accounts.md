# Security operations for privileged accounts in Microsoft Entra ID

The security of business assets depends on the integrity of the privileged accounts that administer your IT systems. Cyber attackers use credential theft attacks and other means to target privileged accounts and gain access to sensitive data.

Traditionally, organizational security has focused on the entry and exit points of a network as the security perimeter. However, software as a service (SaaS) applications and personal devices on the internet have made this approach less effective.

Microsoft Entra ID uses identity and access management (IAM) as the control plane. In your organization's identity layer, users assigned to privileged administrative roles are in control. The accounts used for access must be protected, whether the environment is on-premises, in the cloud, or a hybrid environment.

You're entirely responsible for all layers of security for your on-premises IT environment. When you use Azure services, prevention and response are the joint responsibilities of Microsoft as the cloud service provider and you as the customer.

* For more information on the shared responsibility model, see [Shared responsibility in the cloud](/azure/security/fundamentals/shared-responsibility).
* For more information on securing access for privileged users, see [Securing privileged access for hybrid and cloud deployments in Microsoft Entra ID](~/identity/role-based-access-control/security-planning.md).
* For a wide range of videos, how-to guides, and content of key concepts for privileged identity, see [Privileged Identity Management documentation](~/id-governance/privileged-identity-management/index.yml).

## Log files to monitor

The log files you use for investigation and monitoring are:

* [Microsoft Entra audit logs](~/identity/monitoring-health/concept-audit-logs.md)

* [Microsoft 365 Audit logs](/microsoft-365/compliance/auditing-solutions-overview)

* [Azure Key Vault insights](/azure/key-vault/key-vault-insights-overview)

From the Azure portal, you can view the Microsoft Entra audit logs and download as comma-separated value (CSV) or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) files. The Azure portal has several ways to integrate Microsoft Entra logs with other tools that allow for greater automation of monitoring and alerting:

* **[Microsoft Sentinel](/azure/sentinel/overview)**. Enables intelligent security analytics at the enterprise level by providing security information and event management (SIEM) capabilities.

* **[Sigma rules](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/tree/master/rules/cloud/azure)** - Sigma is an evolving open standard for writing rules and templates that automated management tools can use to parse log files. Where Sigma templates exist for our recommended search criteria, we have added a link to the Sigma repo. The Sigma templates are not written, tested, and managed by Microsoft. Rather, the repo and templates are created and collected by the worldwide IT security community.

* **[Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/overview)**. Enables automated monitoring and alerting of various conditions. Can create or use workbooks to combine data from different sources.

* **[Azure Event Hubs](/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-about)** integrated with a SIEM. Enables Microsoft Entra logs to be pushed to other SIEMs such as Splunk, ArcSight, QRadar, and Sumo Logic via the Azure Event Hubs integration. For more information, see [Stream Microsoft Entra logs to an Azure event hub](~/identity/monitoring-health/howto-stream-logs-to-event-hub.md).

* **[Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/what-is-cloud-app-security)**. Enables you to discover and manage apps, govern across apps and resources, and check your cloud apps' compliance.

* **Microsoft Graph**. Enables you to export data and use Microsoft Graph to do more analysis. For more information, see [Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK and Microsoft Entra ID Protection](~/id-protection/howto-identity-protection-graph-api.md).

* **[Identity Protection](~/id-protection/overview-identity-protection.md)**. Generates three key reports you can use to help with your investigation:

  * **Risky users**. Contains information about which users are at risk, details about detections, history of all risky sign-ins, and risk history.
  
  * **Risky sign-ins**. Contains information about a sign-in that might indicate suspicious circumstances. For more information on investigating information from this report, see [Investigate risk](~/id-protection/howto-identity-protection-investigate-risk.md).
  
  * **Risk detections**. Contains information about other risks triggered when a risk is detected and other pertinent information such as sign-in location and any details from Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps.

* **[Securing workload identities with Identity Protection Preview](~/id-protection/concept-workload-identity-risk.md)**. Use to detect risk on workload identities across sign-in behavior and offline indicators of compromise.

Although we discourage the practice, privileged accounts can have standing administration rights. If you choose to use standing privileges, and the account is compromised, it can have a strongly negative effect. We recommend you prioritize monitoring privileged accounts and include the accounts in your Privileged Identity Management (PIM) configuration. For more information on PIM, see [Start using Privileged Identity Management](~/id-governance/privileged-identity-management/pim-getting-started.md). Also, we recommend you validate that admin accounts:

* Are required.
* Have the least privilege to execute the require activities.
* Are protected with multifactor authentication at a minimum.
* Are run from privileged access workstation (PAW) or secure admin workstation (SAW) devices.

The rest of this article describes what we recommend you monitor and alert on. The article is organized by the type of threat. Where there are specific prebuilt solutions, we link to them following the table. Otherwise, you can build alerts by using the tools described above.

This article provides details on setting baselines and auditing sign-in and usage of privileged accounts. It also discusses tools and resources you can use to help maintain the integrity of your privileged accounts. The content is organized into the following subjects:

* Emergency "break-glass" accounts
* Privileged account sign-in
* Privileged account changes
* Privileged groups
* Privilege assignment and elevation

## Emergency access accounts

It's important that you prevent being accidentally locked out of your Microsoft Entra tenant. 

[!INCLUDE [emergency-access-accounts](../includes/definitions/emergency-access-accounts.md)]

Send a high-priority alert every time an emergency access account is used.

### Discovery

Because break-glass accounts are only used if there's an emergency, your monitoring should discover no account activity. Send a high-priority alert every time an emergency access account is used or changed. Any of the following events might indicate a bad actor is trying to compromise your environments:

* Sign-in.
* Account password change.
* Account permission or roles changed.
* Credential or auth method added or changed.

For more information on managing emergency access accounts, see [Manage emergency access admin accounts in Microsoft Entra ID](~/identity/role-based-access-control/security-emergency-access.md). For detailed information on creating an alert for an emergency account, see [Create an alert rule](~/identity/role-based-access-control/security-emergency-access.md).

## Privileged account sign-in

Monitor all privileged account sign-in activity by using the Microsoft Entra sign-in logs as the data source. In addition to sign-in success and failure information, the logs contain the following details:

* Interrupts
* Device
* Location
* Risk
* Application
* Date and time
* Is the account disabled
* Lockout
* MFA fraud
* Conditional Access failure

### Things to monitor

You can monitor privileged account sign-in events in the Microsoft Entra sign-in logs. Alert on and investigate the following events for privileged accounts.

## Changes by privileged accounts

Monitor all completed and attempted changes by a privileged account. This data enables you to establish what's normal activity for each privileged account and alert on activity that deviates from the expected. The Microsoft Entra audit logs are used to record this type of event. For more information on Microsoft Entra audit logs, see [Audit logs in Microsoft Entra ID](~/identity/monitoring-health/concept-audit-logs.md).

### Microsoft Entra Domain Services

Privileged accounts that have been assigned permissions in Microsoft Entra Domain Services can perform tasks for Microsoft Entra Domain Services that affect the security posture of your Azure-hosted virtual machines that use Microsoft Entra Domain Services. Enable security audits on virtual machines and monitor the logs. For more information on enabling Microsoft Entra Domain Services audits and for a list of sensitive privileges, see the following resources:

* [Enable security audits for Microsoft Entra Domain Services](/entra/identity/domain-services/security-audit-events)
* [Audit Sensitive Privilege Use](/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/audit-sensitive-privilege-use)

## Changes to privileged accounts

Investigate changes to privileged accounts' authentication rules and privileges, especially if the change provides greater privilege or the ability to perform tasks in your Microsoft Entra environment.

## Assignment and elevation

Having privileged accounts that are permanently provisioned with elevated abilities can increase the attack surface and risk to your security boundary. Instead, employ just-in-time access by using an elevation procedure. This type of system allows you to assign eligibility for privileged roles. Admins elevate their privileges to those roles only when they perform tasks that need those privileges. Using an elevation process enables you to monitor elevations and non-use of privileged accounts.

### Establish a baseline

To monitor for exceptions, you must first create a baseline. Determine the following information for these elements

* **Admin accounts**

  * Your privileged account strategy
  * Use of on-premises accounts to administer on-premises resources
  * Use of cloud-based accounts to administer cloud-based resources
  * Approach to separating and monitoring administrative permissions for on-premises and cloud-based resources

* **Privileged role protection**

  * Protection strategy for roles that have administrative privileges
  * Organizational policy for using privileged accounts
  * Strategy and principles for maintaining permanent privilege versus providing time-bound and approved access

The following concepts and information help determine policies:

* **Just-in-time admin principles**. Use the Microsoft Entra logs to capture information for performing administrative tasks that are common in your environment. Determine the typical amount of time needed to complete the tasks.
* **Just-enough admin principles**. Determine the least-privileged role, which might be a custom role, that's needed for administrative tasks. For more information, see [Least privileged roles by task in Microsoft Entra ID](~/identity/role-based-access-control/delegate-by-task.md).
* **Establish an elevation policy**. After you have insight into the type of elevated privilege needed and how long is needed for each task, create policies that reflect elevated privileged usage for your environment. As an example, define a policy to limit role elevation to one hour.

After you establish your baseline and set policy, you can configure monitoring to detect and alert usage outside of policy.

### Discovery

Pay particular attention to and investigate changes in assignment and elevation of privilege.

### Things to monitor

You can monitor privileged account changes by using Microsoft Entra audit logs and Azure Monitor logs. Include the following changes in your monitoring process.

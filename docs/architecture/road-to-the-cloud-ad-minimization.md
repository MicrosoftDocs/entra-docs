# Active Directory minimization case studies

Active Directory minimization refers to the strategic reduction of dependency on traditional on-premises Active Directory services by moving identity and device management to cloud-based platforms. This article list real-world case studies that demonstrate how companies have successfully implemented Active Directory minimization strategies while maintaining security and operational efficiency.

## Benefits

Active Directory minimization includes the following benefits: 

- **Reduced infrastructure costs:** Lower maintenance overhead for on-premises Active Directory infrastructure
- **Enhanced security:** Modern authentication and conditional access policies
- **Improved user experience:** Seamless access to resources from any device, anywhere
- **Simplified management:** Centralized cloud-based device and identity management

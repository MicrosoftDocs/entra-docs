# Microsoft Entra security operations for consumer accounts

Consumer identity activities are an important area for your organization to protect and monitor. This article is for Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C) tenants and has guidance for monitoring consumer account activities. The activities are:

* Consumer account 
* Privileged account 
* Application 
* Infrastructure 

## Before you begin

Before using the guidance in this article, we recommend you read, [Microsoft Entra security operations guide](security-operations-introduction.md).

## Define a baseline

To discover anomalous behavior, define normal and expected behavior. Defining expected behavior for your organization helps you discover unexpected behavior. Use the definition to help reduce false positives, during monitoring and alerting.

With expected behavior defined, perform baseline monitoring to validate expectations. Then, monitor logs for what falls outside tolerance.

For accounts created outside normal processes, use the Microsoft Entra audit logs, Microsoft Entra sign-in logs, and directory attributes as your data sources. The following suggestions can help you define normal.

### Consumer account creation

Evaluate the following list:

* Strategy and principles for tools and processes to create and manage consumer accounts 
  * For example, standard attributes and formats applied to consumer account attributes
* Approved sources for account creation. 
  * For example, onboarding custom policies, customer provisioning or migration tool
* Alert strategy for accounts created outside approved sources. 
  * Create a controlled list of organizations your organization collaborates with
* Strategy and alert parameters for accounts created, modified, or disabled by an unapproved consumer account administrator
* Monitoring and alert strategy for consumer accounts missing standard attributes, such as customer number, or not following organizational naming conventions
* Strategy, principles, and process for account deletion and retention

## Where to look

Use log files to investigate and monitor. See the following articles for more:

* [Audit logs in Microsoft Entra ID](~/identity/monitoring-health/concept-audit-logs.md)
* [Sign-in logs in Microsoft Entra ID (preview)](~/identity/monitoring-health/concept-sign-ins.md)
* [How To: Investigate risk](~/id-protection/howto-identity-protection-investigate-risk.md)

### Audit logs and automation tools

From the Azure portal, you can view Microsoft Entra audit logs and download as comma separated value (CSV) or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) files. Use the Azure portal to integrate Microsoft Entra logs with other tools to automate monitoring and alerting:

* **Microsoft Sentinel** – security analytics with security information and event management (SIEM) capabilities
  * [What is Microsoft Sentinel?](/azure/sentinel/overview)
* **Sigma rules** - an open standard for writing rules and templates that automated management tools can use to parse log files. If there are Sigma templates for our recommended search criteria, we added a link to the Sigma repo. Microsoft doesn't write, test, or manage Sigma templates. The repo and templates are created, and collected, by the IT security community.
  * [SigmaHR/sigma](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/tree/master/rules/cloud/azure)
* **Azure Monitor** – automated monitoring and alerting of various conditions. Create or use workbooks to combine data from different sources.
  * [Azure Monitor overview](/azure/azure-monitor/overview)
* **Azure Event Hubs integrated with a SIEM** - integrate Microsoft Entra logs with SIEMs such as Splunk, ArcSight, QRadar and Sumo Logic with Azure Event Hubs
  * [Azure Event Hubs-A big data streaming platform and event ingestion service](/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-about)
  * [Tutorial: Stream Microsoft Entra logs to an Azure event hub](~/identity/monitoring-health/howto-stream-logs-to-event-hub.md)
* **Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps** – discover and manage apps, govern across apps and resources, and conform cloud app compliance
  * [Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps overview](/defender-cloud-apps/what-is-defender-for-cloud-apps)
* **Identity Protection** - detect risk on workload identities across sign-in behavior and offline indicators of compromise
  * [Securing workload identities with Identity Protection](~/id-protection/concept-workload-identity-risk.md)

Use the remainder of the article for recommendations on what to monitor and alert. Refer to the tables, organized by threat type. See links to pre-built solutions or samples following the table. Build alerts using the previously mentioned tools.

## Consumer accounts

| What to monitor | Risk level | Where | Filter / subfilter | Notes |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| Large number of account creations or deletions | High | Microsoft Entra audit logs | Activity: Add user<br>Status = success<br>Initiated by (actor) = CPIM Service<br>-and-<br>Activity: Delete user<br>Status = success<br>Initiated by (actor) = CPIM Service | Define a baseline threshold, and then monitor and adjust to suit your organizational behaviors. Limit false alerts. |
| Accounts created and deleted by nonapproved users or processes| Medium | Microsoft Entra audit logs | Initiated by (actor) – USER PRINCIPAL NAME<br>-and-<br>Activity: Add user<br>Status = success<br>Initiated by (actor) != CPIM Service<br>and-or<br>Activity: Delete user<br>Status = success<br>Initiated by (actor) != CPIM Service | If the actors are nonapproved users, configure to send an alert. |
| Accounts assigned to a privileged role| High | Microsoft Entra audit logs | Activity: Add user<br>Status = success<br>Initiated by (actor) == CPIM Service<br>-and-<br>Activity: Add member to role<br>Status = success | If the account is assigned to a Microsoft Entra role, Azure role, or privileged group membership, alert and prioritize the investigation. |
| Failed sign-in attempts| Medium - if Isolated incident<br>High - if many accounts are experiencing the same pattern | Microsoft Entra sign-in log | Status = failed<br>-and-<br>Sign-in error code 50126 - Error validating credentials due to invalid username or password.<br>-and-<br>Application == "CPIM PowerShell Client"<br>-or-<br>Application == "ProxyIdentityExperienceFramework" | Define a baseline threshold, and then monitor and adjust to suit your organizational behaviors and limit false alerts from being generated. |
| Smart lock-out events| Medium - if Isolated incident<br>High - if many accounts are experiencing the same pattern or a VIP | Microsoft Entra sign-in log | Status = failed<br>-and-<br>Sign-in error code = 50053 – IdsLocked<br>-and-<br>Application == "CPIM PowerShell Client"<br>-or-<br>Application =="ProxyIdentityExperienceFramework" | Define a baseline threshold, and then monitor and adjust to suit your organizational behaviors and limit false alerts. |
| Failed authentications from countries or regions you don't operate from| Medium | Microsoft Entra sign-in log | Status = failed<br>-and-<br>Location = \<unapproved location><br>-and-<br>Application == "CPIM PowerShell Client"<br>-or-<br>Application == "ProxyIdentityExperienceFramework" | Monitor entries not equal to provided city names. |
| Increased failed authentications of any type | Medium | Microsoft Entra sign-in log | Status = failed<br>-and-<br>Application == "CPIM PowerShell Client"<br>-or-<br>Application == "ProxyIdentityExperienceFramework" | If you don't have a threshold, monitor and alert if failures increase by 10%, or greater. |
| Account disabled/blocked for sign-ins | Low | Microsoft Entra sign-in log | Status = Failure<br>-and-<br>error code = 50057, The user account is disabled. | This scenario could indicate someone trying to gain access to an account after they left an organization. The account is blocked, but it's important to log and alert this activity. |
| Measurable increase of successful sign-ins | Low | Microsoft Entra sign-in log | Status = Success<br>-and-<br>Application == "CPIM PowerShell Client"<br>-or-<br>Application == "ProxyIdentityExperienceFramework" | If you don't have a threshold, monitor and alert if successful authentications increase by 10%, or greater. |

## Privileged accounts

| What to monitor | Risk level | Where | Filter / subfilter | Notes |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| Sign-in failure, bad password threshold | High | Microsoft Entra sign-in log | Status = Failure<br>-and-<br>error code = 50126 | Define a baseline threshold and monitor and adjust to suit your organizational behaviors. Limit false alerts. |
| Failure because of Conditional Access requirement | High | Microsoft Entra sign-in log | Status = Failure<br>-and-<br>error code = 53003<br>-and-<br>Failure reason = Blocked by Conditional Access | The event can indicate an attacker is trying to get into the account. |
| Interrupt | High, medium | Microsoft Entra sign-in log | Status = Failure<br>-and-<br>error code = 53003<br>-and-<br>Failure reason = Blocked by Conditional Access | The event can indicate an attacker has the account password, but can't pass the MFA challenge. |
| Account lockout | High | Microsoft Entra sign-in log | Status = Failure<br>-and-<br>error code = 50053 | Define a baseline threshold, then monitor and adjust to suit your organizational behaviors. Limit false alerts. |
| Account disabled or blocked for sign-ins | low | Microsoft Entra sign-in log | Status = Failure<br>-and-<br>Target = User UPN<br>-and-<br>error code = 50057 | The event could indicate someone trying to gain account access after they've left the organization. Although the account is blocked, log and alert this activity. |
| MFA fraud alert or block | High | Microsoft Entra sign-in log/Azure Log Analytics | Sign-ins>Authentication details<br> Result details = MFA denied, fraud code entered | Privileged user indicates they haven't instigated the MFA prompt, which could indicate an attacker has the account password. |
| MFA fraud alert or block | High | Microsoft Entra sign-in log/Azure Log Analytics | Activity type = Fraud reported - User is blocked for MFA or fraud reported - No action taken, based on fraud report tenant-level settings | Privileged user indicated no instigation of the MFA prompt.

| Outside of normal sign-in times | High | Microsoft Entra sign-in log | Status = Success<br>-and-<br>Location =<br>-and-<br>Time = Outside of working hours | Monitor and alert if sign-ins occur outside expected times. Find the normal working pattern for each privileged account and alert if there are unplanned changes outside normal working times. Sign-ins outside normal working hours could indicate compromise or possible insider threat. |
| Password change | High | Microsoft Entra audit logs | Activity actor = Admin/self-service<br>-and-<br>Target = User<br>-and-<br>Status = Success or failure | Alert when any administrator account password changes. Write a query for privileged accounts. |
| Changes to authentication methods | High | Microsoft Entra audit logs | Activity: Create identity provider<br>Category: ResourceManagement<br>Target: User Principal Name | The change could indicate an attacker adding an auth method to the account to have continued access. |
| Identity Provider updated by nonapproved actors | High | Microsoft Entra audit logs | Activity: Update identity provider<br>Category: ResourceManagement<br>Target: User Principal Name | The change could indicate an attacker adding an auth method to the account to have continued access. |
Identity Provider deleted by nonapproved actors | High | Microsoft Entra access reviews | Activity: Delete identity provider<br>Category: ResourceManagement<br>Target: User Principal Name | The change could indicate an attacker adding an auth method to the account to have continued access. |

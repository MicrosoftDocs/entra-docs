# Microsoft Entra deployment scenario - Workforce and guest onboarding, identity, and access lifecycle governance across all your apps

The Microsoft Entra deployment scenarios provide you with detailed guidance on how to combine and test these Microsoft Entra Suite products:

- [Microsoft Entra ID Protection](../id-protection/overview-identity-protection.md)
- [Microsoft Entra ID Governance](../id-governance/identity-governance-overview.md)
- [Microsoft Entra Verified ID (premium capabilities)](../verified-id/decentralized-identifier-overview.md)
- [Microsoft Entra Internet Access](../global-secure-access/concept-internet-access.md)
- [Microsoft Entra Private Access](../global-secure-access/concept-private-access.md)

In these guides, we describe scenarios that show the value of the Microsoft Entra Suite and how its capabilities work together.

- [Microsoft Entra deployment scenario - Secure internet access based on business needs](deployment-scenario-internet-access.md)

## Scenario overview

In this guide, we describe how to configure Microsoft Entra Suite products for a scenario in which the fictional organization, Contoso, wants to hire new remote employees and provide them with secure and seamless access to necessary apps and resources. They want to invite and collaborate with external users (such as partners, vendors, or customers) and provide them with access to relevant apps and resources.

Contoso uses [Microsoft Entra Verified ID](../verified-id/decentralized-identifier-overview.md) to issue and verify digital proofs of identity and status for new remote employees (based on human resources data) and external users (based on email invitations). Digital wallets store identity proof and status to allow access to apps and resources. As an extra security measure, Contoso might verify identity with Face Check facial recognition based on the picture that the credential stores.

They use Microsoft Entra ID Governance to create and grant access packages for employees and external users based on verifiable credentials.

- For employees, they base access packages on job function and department. Access packages include cloud and on-premises apps and resources to which employees need access.
- For external collaborators, they base access packages on invitation to define external user roles and permissions. The access packages include only apps and resources to which external users need access.

Employees and external users can request access packages through a self-service portal where they provide digital proofs as identity verification. With single sign-on and multifactor authentication, employee and external user Microsoft Entra accounts provide access to apps and resources that their access packages include. Contoso verifies credentials and grants access packages without requiring manual approvals or provisioning.

Contoso uses Microsoft Entra ID Protection and Conditional Access to monitor and protect accounts from risky sign-ins and user behavior. They enforce appropriate access controls based on location, device, and risk level.

## Request access package

After you configure an access package with a Verified ID requirement, end-users who are within the scope of the policy can request access in their **My Access** portal. While approvers review requests for approval, they can see the claims of the verified credentials that requestors present.

1. As a remote user or guest, sign in to `myaccess.microsoft.com`.
1. Search for the access package that you previously created (such as *Finance Apps for Remote Users*). You can browse the listed packages or use the search bar. Select **Request**.
1. The system displays an information banner with a message such as, *To request access to this access package you need to present your Verifiable Credentials*. Select **Request Access**. To launch Microsoft Authenticator, scan the QR Code with your phone. Share your credentials.

   :::image type="content" source="media/deployment-scenario-workforce-guest/present-verified-id.png" alt-text="Screenshot of My Access, Available, Access packages, Present Verified ID, QR Code.":::

1. After you share your credentials, continue with the approval workflow.
1. **Optional:** Follow the [Simulating risk detections in Microsoft Entra ID Protection](../id-protection/howto-identity-protection-simulate-risk.md) instructions. You might need to try multiple times to raise the user risk to medium or high.
1. Try accessing the application that you previously created for the scenario to confirm blocked access. You might need to wait up to one hour for block enforcement.
1. Use sign in logs to validate blocked access by the Conditional Access policy that you created earlier. Open non-interactive sign in logs from the *ZTNA Network Access Client -- Private* application. View logs from the Private Access application name that you previously created as the **Resource name**.

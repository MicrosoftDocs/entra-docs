### B2B collaboration and guest users

To collaborate with guest users, you can let them use their preferred identity to sign in to your app or other enterprise apps: SaaS, custom-developed, and more. Typically, B2B collaboration users are in your directory as guest users.  

Learn more in the overview, [B2B collaboration with external guests for your workforce](../external-id/what-is-b2b.md). 

## Provision guest users in Microsoft Entra ID

Users can use Microsoft Entra [entitlement management](../id-governance/entitlement-management-overview.md) self-service features to sign up for access. Learn about [self-service sign-up](../external-id/self-service-sign-up-overview.md), and how to [manage external access with entitlement management](../architecture/6-secure-access-entitlement-managment.md).  

### Entitlement management or self-service signup

Use the following table to ease decision making.

|Entitlement management|Both|Self-service signup|
|---|---|---|
|- Requested with My Access portal or link </br> - Access packages </br> - Built-in approval workflows </br> - Scope requests by organization </br> - Lifecycle automation </br> - Supports Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) and Web Service Federation (WS-Fed) identities|- Request triggered by end user </br> - Collect other attributes </br> - Trigger custom logic apps and APIs </br> - Available to anyone </br> - Supports: Microsoft Entra ID, email one-time pass (OTP)|- Branded onboarding sign-in page </br> - Users create accounts at the app </br> - Language options </br> - Supports: Google, Microsoft Account (MSA), Facebook |

## Onboarding and discovery

With the [Microsoft Identity Governance dashboard](../id-governance/governance-dashboard.md), discover usage information about identity features configured in your tenant. See the current state of your environment, determine response actions, and find links to documentation. 

### External user insights

Over time, external user accounts are created in the Microsoft Entra tenant. When external users, or guests, stop accessing the tenant, the external user account becomes stale. 

You can [monitor and clean up stale guest access accounts using access reviews](../identity/users/clean-up-stale-guest-accounts.md).

### External user attribute management

Approvers allow or deny requests for access packages. To help Approvers make access decisions about onboarding external users, you can include custom questions in an access request flow. Store Requestor information for apps or other processes.  

## Entitlement management

Decentralized identity solutions enable individuals to control their digital identities and manage identity data without reliance on a centralized authority or intermediary. Reduce the need for new employees or business partners to perform self-attestation. Simplify approval processes and simplify your compliance posture. Learn more about [Microsoft Verified ID](../verified-id/decentralized-identifier-overview.md) in entitlement management. 

### External user assignments and access packages

When external users request initial access, they're invited to your directory and assigned access. In entitlement management, use access packages to assign access to multiple resources. Ensure access packages are in a container called a catalog, which has resources you can add to access package.  

* [Govern access for external users in entitlement management](../id-governance/entitlement-management-external-users.md)
* [Create an access package in entitlement management](../id-governance/entitlement-management-access-package-create.md)
* [View, add, and remove assignments for an access package](../id-governance/entitlement-management-access-package-assignments.md)

## Manage the external user lifecycle

In entitlement management, external users have three states: governed, ungoverned, and blank. External users invited to your tenant are ungoverned. The ungoverned can lose their last access package assignment yet remain in the tenant indefinitely. To manage the lifecycle, convert the ungoverned to governed while they have access. 

Learn to [govern access for external users in entitlement management](../id-governance/entitlement-management-external-users.md).

### Guest user risk in Microsoft Teams and Microsoft 365 Groups

Access reviews include new groups with guest users and groups with recently added guests. Review recommendations are based on last sign-in details. As an option, denied guests are blocked from sign-in, then the account is deleted.

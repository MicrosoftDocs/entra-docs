# Passwordless authentication with Microsoft Entra ID

Microsoft Entra ID enables integration with the following passwordless authentication protocols.

- [Overview of Microsoft Entra certificate-based authentication](~/identity/authentication/concept-certificate-based-authentication.md): Microsoft Entra certificate-based authentication (CBA) enables customers to allow or require users to authenticate directly with X.509 certificates against their Microsoft Entra ID for applications and browser sign-in. This feature enables customers to adopt phishing resistant authentication and authenticate with an X.509 certificate against their Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).
- [Enable passwordless security key sign-in](~/identity/authentication/howto-authentication-passwordless-security-key.md): For enterprises that use passwords and have a shared PC environment, security keys provide a seamless way for workers to authenticate without entering a username or password. Security keys provide improved productivity for workers, and have better security. This article explains how to sign in to web-based applications with your Microsoft Entra account using a FIDO2 security key.
- [Windows Hello for Business Overview](/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/): Windows Hello for Business replaces passwords with strong two-factor authentication on devices. This authentication consists of a type of user credential that is tied to a device and uses a biometric or PIN.
- [Enable passwordless sign-in with Microsoft Authenticator](~/identity/authentication/howto-authentication-passwordless-phone.md): Microsoft Authenticator can be used to sign in to any Microsoft Entra account without using a password. Microsoft Authenticator uses key-based authentication to enable a user credential that is tied to a device, where the device uses a PIN or biometric. Windows Hello for Business uses a similar technology. Microsoft Authenticator can be used on any device platform, including mobile. Microsoft Authenticator can be used with any app or website that integrates with Microsoft Authentication Libraries.

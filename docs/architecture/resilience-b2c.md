# Build resilience in your customer identity and access management with Azure Active Directory B2C

[Azure AD B2C](/azure/active-directory-b2c/overview) is a Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) platform that is designed to help you launch your critical customer facing applications successfully. We have many built-in features for [resilience](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/advancing-azure-active-directory-availability/) that are designed to help our service scale to your needs and improve resilience in the face of potential outage situations. In addition, when launching a mission critical application, it's important to consider various design and configuration elements in your application. Consider how the application is configured within Azure AD B2C to ensure that you get a resilient behavior in response to outage or failure scenarios. In this article, we'll discuss some of the best practices to help you increase resilience.

A resilient service is one that continues to function despite disruptions. You can help improve resilience in your service by:

- understanding all the components

- eliminating single points of failures

- isolating failing components to limit their impact

- providing redundancy with fast failover mechanisms and recovery paths

As you develop your application, we recommend considering how to [increase resilience of authentication and authorization in your applications](resilience-app-development-overview.md) with the identity components of your solution. This article attempts to address enhancements for resilience specific to Azure AD B2C applications. Our recommendations are grouped by CIAM functions.

In the subsequent sections, we'll guide you to build resilience in the following areas:

- [End-user experience](resilient-end-user-experience.md): Enable a fallback plan for your authentication flow and mitigate the potential impact from a disruption of Azure AD B2C authentication service.

- [Interfaces with external processes](resilient-external-processes.md): Build resilience in your applications and interfaces by recovering from errors.  

- [Developer best practices](resilience-b2c-developer-best-practices.md): Avoid fragility because of common custom policy issues and improve error handling in the areas like interactions with claims verifiers, third-party applications, and REST APIs.

- [Monitoring and analytics](resilience-with-monitoring-alerting.md): Assess the health of your service by monitoring key indicators and detect failures and performance disruptions through alerting.

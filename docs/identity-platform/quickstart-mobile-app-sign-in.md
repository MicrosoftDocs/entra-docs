::: zone pivot="workforce"

#### [Android](#tab/android-workforce)

In this quickstart, you download and run a code sample that demonstrates how an Android application can sign in users and get an access token to call the Microsoft Graph API.

Applications must be represented by an app object in Microsoft Entra ID so that the Microsoft identity platform can provide tokens to your application.

#### [iOS/macOS](#tab/ios-macos-workforce)

In this quickstart, you download and run a code sample that demonstrates how a native iOS or macOS application can sign in users and get an access token to call the Microsoft Graph API.

The quickstart applies to both iOS and macOS apps. Some steps are needed only for iOS apps and will be indicated as such.

---

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't already have one, [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* This Azure account must have permissions to manage applications. Any of the following Microsoft Entra roles include the required permissions:
  * Application Administrator
  * Application Developer
* A workforce tenant. You can use your Default Directory or [set up a new tenant](./quickstart-create-new-tenant.md).

#### [Android](#tab/android-workforce)

* Register a new app in the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com), configured for *Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts*. Refer to [Register an application](quickstart-register-app.md) for more details. Record the following values from the application **Overview** page for later use:
  * Application (client) ID 
  * Directory (tenant) ID
* Android Studio
* Android 16+

#### [iOS/macOS](#tab/ios-macos-workforce)

* Register a new app in the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com), configured for *Accounts in this organizational directory only*. Refer to [Register an application](quickstart-register-app.md) for more details. Record the following values from the application **Overview** page for later use:
  * Application (client) ID 
  * Directory (tenant) ID
* XCode 10+
* iOS 10+
* macOS 10.12+

---

## Add a redirect URI

You must configure specific redirect URIs in your app registration to ensure compatibility with the downloaded code sample. These URIs are essential for redirecting users back to the app after they successfully sign in.

#### [Android](#tab/android-workforce)

1. Under **Manage**, select **Authentication** > **Add a platform** > **Android**.
1. Enter your project's Package Name based on the sample type you downloaded above.
   - Java sample - `com.azuresamples.msalandroidapp`
   - Kotlin sample - `com.azuresamples.msalandroidkotlinapp`
1. In the **Signature hash** section of the **Configure your Android app** pane, select **Generating a development Signature Hash.** and copy the KeyTool command to your command line.

   - KeyTool.exe is installed as part of the Java Development Kit (JDK). You must also install the OpenSSL tool to execute the KeyTool command. For more information, see [Android documentation on generating a key](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#generate-key) for more information.

1. Enter the **Signature hash** generated by KeyTool.
1. Select **Configure** and save the **MSAL Configuration** that appears in the **Android configuration** pane so you can enter it when you configure your app later.
1. Select **Done**.

#### [iOS/macOS](#tab/ios-macos-workforce)

1. Under **Manage**, select **Authentication** > **Add Platform** > **iOS**.
1. Enter the **Bundle Identifier** for your application. The bundle identifier is a unique string that uniquely identifies your application, for example `com.<yourname>.identitysample.MSALMacOS`. Make a note of the value you use. Note that the iOS configuration is also applicable to macOS applications.
1. Select **Configure** and save the **MSAL Configuration** details for later in this quickstart.
1. Select **Done**.

## Download the sample app

### [Android](#tab/android-workforce)

- Java: [Download the code](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-android-java/archive/master.zip).
- Kotlin: [Download the code](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-android-kotlin/archive/master.zip).

### [iOS/macOS](#tab/ios-macos-workforce)

Download the sample project

- [Download the code sample for iOS](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-ios-swift-native-v2/archive/master.zip)
- [Download the code sample for macOS](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-macOS-swift-native-v2/archive/master.zip)

### Install dependencies

1. Extract the zip file.
1. In a terminal window, navigate to the folder with the downloaded code sample and run `pod install` to install the latest MSAL library.

---

## Configure the sample application

#### [Android](#tab/android-workforce)

1. In Android Studio's project pane, navigate to **app\src\main\res**.
1. Right-click **res** and choose **New** > **Directory**. Enter `raw` as the new directory name and select **OK**.
1. In **app** > **src** > **main** > **res** > **raw**, go to JSON file called `auth_config_single_account.json` and paste the MSAL Configuration that you saved earlier.

   Below the redirect URI, paste:

   ```json
     "account_mode" : "SINGLE",
   ```

   Your config file should resemble this example:

   ```json
   {
     "client_id": "00001111-aaaa-bbbb-3333-cccc4444",
     "authorization_user_agent": "WEBVIEW",
     "redirect_uri": "msauth://com.azuresamples.msalandroidapp/00001111%cccc4444%3D",
     "broker_redirect_uri_registered": false,
     "account_mode": "SINGLE",
     "authorities": [
       {
         "type": "AAD",
         "audience": {
           "type": "AzureADandPersonalMicrosoftAccount",
           "tenant_id": "common"
         }
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

1. Open */app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml* file.
1. Find the placeholder:

    - `enter_the_signature_hash` and replace it with the **Signature Hash** that you generated earlier when you added the platform redirect URL.


   As this tutorial only demonstrates how to configure an app in Single Account mode, see [single vs. multiple account mode](./single-multi-account.md) and [configuring your app](./msal-configuration.md) for more information

## Run the sample app

Select your emulator, or physical device, from Android Studio's **available devices** dropdown and run the app.

The sample app starts on the **Single Account Mode** screen. A default scope, **user.read**, is provided by default, which is used when reading your own profile data during the Microsoft Graph API call. The URL for the Microsoft Graph API call is provided by default. You can change both of these if you wish.

![Screenshot of the MSAL sample app showing single and multiple account usage.](media/quickstart-v2-android/quickstart-sample-app.png)

Use the app menu to change between single and multiple account modes.

In single account mode, sign in using a work or home account:

1. Select **Get graph data interactively** to prompt the user for their credentials. You'll see the output from the call to the Microsoft Graph API in the bottom of the screen.
2. Once signed in, select **Get graph data silently** to make a call to the Microsoft Graph API without prompting the user for credentials again. You'll see the output from the call to the Microsoft Graph API in the bottom of the screen.

In multiple account mode, you can repeat the same steps. Additionally, you can remove the signed-in account, which also removes the cached tokens for that account.

#### [iOS/macOS](#tab/ios-macos-workforce)

If you selected Option 1 above, you can skip these steps.
1. Open the project in XCode.
1. Edit **ViewController.swift** and replace the line starting with 'let kClientID' with the following code snippet. Remember to update the value for `kClientID` with the clientID that you saved when you registered your app earlier in this quickstart:

   ```swift
   let kClientID = "Enter_the_Application_Id_Here"
   ```

1. If you're building an app for [Microsoft Entra national clouds](/graph/deployments#app-registration-and-token-service-root-endpoints), replace the line starting with 'let kGraphEndpoint' and 'let kAuthority' with correct endpoints. For global access, use default values:

   ```swift
   let kGraphEndpoint = "https://graph.microsoft.com/"
   let kAuthority = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/common"
   ```

1. Other endpoints are documented [here](/graph/deployments#app-registration-and-token-service-root-endpoints). For example, to run the quickstart with Microsoft Entra Germany, use following:

   ```swift
   let kGraphEndpoint = "https://graph.microsoft.de/"
   let kAuthority = "https://login.microsoftonline.de/common"
   ```

3. Open the project settings. In the **Identity** section, enter the **Bundle Identifier**.
4. Right-click **Info.plist** and select **Open As** > **Source Code**.
5. Under the dict root node, replace `Enter_the_bundle_Id_Here` with the ***Bundle Id*** that you used in the portal. Notice the `msauth.` prefix in the string.

   ```xml
   <key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
   <array>
      <dict>
         <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
         <array>
            <string>msauth.Enter_the_Bundle_Id_Here</string>
         </array>
      </dict>
   </array>
   ```

6. Build and run the app!

## How the sample works

#### [Android](#tab/android-workforce)

![Diagram showing how the sample app generated by this quickstart works.](media/quickstart-v2-android/android-intro.svg)

The code is organized into fragments that show how to write a single and multiple accounts MSAL app. The code files are organized as follows:

| File                                    | Demonstrates                                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MainActivity                            | Manages the UI                                                                                                   |
| MSGraphRequestWrapper                   | Calls the Microsoft Graph API using the token provided by MSAL                                                   |
| MultipleAccountModeFragment             | Initializes a multi-account application, loads a user account, and gets a token to call the Microsoft Graph API  |
| SingleAccountModeFragment               | Initializes a single-account application, loads a user account, and gets a token to call the Microsoft Graph API |
| res/auth_config_multiple_account.json   | The multiple account configuration file                                                                          |
| res/auth_config_single_account.json     | The single account configuration file                                                                            |
| Gradle Scripts/build.grade (Module:app) | The MSAL library dependencies are added here                                                                     |

We'll now look at these files in more detail and call out the MSAL-specific code in each.

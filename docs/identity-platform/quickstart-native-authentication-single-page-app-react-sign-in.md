#Customer intent: As a developer, I want to configure a sample React single-page application using native authentication so that I can authenticate users, including sign-up, sign-in, sign-out, and password reset flows.

# Quickstart: Sign in users in a sample React single-page application by using native authentication (preview)

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-external-only](../external-id/includes/applies-to-external-only.md)]

In this quickstart, you use a React single-page application (SPA) to demonstrate how to authenticate users by using [native authentication API](reference-native-authentication-api.md). The sample app demonstrates user sign-up, sign in, sign out and password reset with an email and a password.

## Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or another code editor.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
- An external tenant. To create one, choose from the following methods:
  - (Recommended) Use the [Microsoft Entra External ID extension](https://aka.ms/ciamvscode/samples/marketplace) to set up an external tenant directly in Visual Studio Code.
  - [Create a new external tenant](../external-id/customers/how-to-create-external-tenant-portal.md) in the Microsoft Entra admin center.

## Register an application
 
[!INCLUDE [register client app](../external-id/customers/includes/register-app/register-client-app-common.md)]
 
## Enable public client and native authentication flows 

[!INCLUDE [Enable public client and native authentication](../external-id/customers/includes/native-auth/enable-native-authentication.md)]
 
## Grant admin consent
 
[!INCLUDE [Grant API permissions](../external-id/customers/includes/register-app/grant-api-permission-sign-in.md)]

## Create a user flow
 
[!INCLUDE [Create user flow](../external-id/customers/includes/configure-user-flow/create-native-authentication-sign-in-sign-out-user-flow.md)]

> [!NOTE] 
> For this quickstart, select **Given Name** and **Surname** as your user attributes. The sample app in this quickstart submits the given name and surname to the native authentication API. If you select any other user attribute, the sample won't work properly
 
## Associate the app with the user flow

[!INCLUDE [associate user flow](../external-id/customers/includes/configure-user-flow/add-app-user-flow.md)]

## Clone or download sample SPA

To obtain the sample application, you can either clone it from GitHub or download it as a .zip file.

To clone the sample, open a command prompt and navigate to where you wish to create the project, and enter the following command:

```console
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-ciam-native-javascript-samples.git
```

Alternatively, [Download the sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-ciam-native-javascript-samples/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), then extract it to a file path where the length of the name is fewer than 260 characters.

## Install project dependencies

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory that contains the React sample app:

    ```console
    cd API\React\ReactAuthSimple
    ```

1. Run the following command to install app dependencies:

    ```console
    npm install
    ```

## Configure the sample React app

1. In your code editor, open *src\config.ts* file.

1. Find the placeholder `Enter_the_Application_Id_Here` and replace it with the Application (client) ID of the app you registered earlier.

1. Save the changes.

## Configure CORS proxy server

The native authentication APIs don't support [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) so you must set up a proxy server between your SPA app and the APIs.

This code sample includes a CORS proxy server that forwards requests to native authentication API URL endpoints. The CORS proxy server is a Node.js server that listens on port 3001.

To configure the proxy server, open the *proxy.config.js* file, then the find the placeholder:

- `tenantSubdomain` and replace it with the Directory (tenant) subdomain. For example, if your tenant primary domain is `contoso.onmicrosoft.com`, use `contoso`. If you don't have your tenant subdomain, learn how to [read your tenant details](../external-id/customers/how-to-create-external-tenant-portal.md#get-the-external-tenant-details).
- `tenantId` and replace it with the Directory (tenant) ID. If you don't have your tenant ID, learn how to [read your tenant details](../external-id/customers/how-to-create-external-tenant-portal.md#get-the-external-tenant-details).

## Run and test your app

You've now configured the sample app and it's ready to run.

1. From your terminal window, run the following commands to start the CORS proxy server:

    ```console
    cd API\React\ReactAuthSimple
    npm run cors
    ```

1. To start your React app, open another terminal window, then run the following commands:

    ```console
    cd API\React\ReactAuthSimple
    npm start
    ```

1. Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000/`.

1. To sign up for an account, select **Sign Up**, then follow the prompts.

1. After you sign up, test sign-in and password reset by selecting **Sign In** and **Reset Password** respectively.

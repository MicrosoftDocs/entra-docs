# Remove an application registered with the Microsoft identity platform

Enterprise developers and software-as-a-service (SaaS) providers who have registered applications with the Microsoft identity platform may need to remove an application's registration.

In the following sections, you learn how to:

- Remove an application authored by you or your organization
- Remove an application authored by another organization

## Prerequisites

- An [application registered in your Microsoft Entra tenant](quickstart-register-app.md)

## Remove an application authored by you or your organization

[!INCLUDE [portal updates](~/includes/portal-update.md)]

Applications that you or your organization have registered are represented by both an application object and service principal object in your tenant. For more information, see [Application objects and service principal objects](./app-objects-and-service-principals.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Deleting an application will also delete its service principal object in the application's home directory. For multi-tenant applications, service principal objects in other directories will not be deleted.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator). 
1. If you have access to multiple tenants, use the **Settings** icon :::image type="icon" source="./media/common/admin-center-settings-icon.png" border="false"::: in the top menu to switch to the tenant containing the app registration from the **Directories + subscriptions** menu.
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **App registrations** and then select the application that you want to configure. Once you've selected the app, you see the application's **Overview** page.
1. From the **Overview** page, select **Delete**.
1. Read the deletion consequences.  Check the box if one appears at the bottom of the pane.
1. Select **Delete** to confirm that you want to delete the app.

## Remove an application authored by another organization

If you're viewing **App registrations** in the context of a tenant, a subset of the applications that appear under the **All apps** tab are from another tenant and were registered into your tenant during the consent process. More specifically, they're represented by only a service principal object in your tenant, with no corresponding application object. For more information on the differences between application and service principal objects, see [Application and service principal objects in Microsoft Entra ID](./app-objects-and-service-principals.md).

In order to remove an applicationâ€™s access to your directory (after having granted consent), the company administrator must remove its service principal. The administrator must have at least the [Privileged Role Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#privileged-role-administrator) access. To learn how to delete a service principal, see [Delete an enterprise application](~/identity/enterprise-apps/delete-application-portal.md).

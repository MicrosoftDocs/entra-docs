# Purpose:

## Retrying after errors and exceptions

You're expected to implement your own retry policies when calling MSAL. MSAL makes HTTP calls to the Microsoft Entra service, and occasionally failures can occur. For example the network can go down or the server is overloaded.  

### HTTP 429

When the Service Token Server (STS) is overloaded with too many requests, it returns HTTP error 429 with a hint about how long until you can try again in the `Retry-After` response field.

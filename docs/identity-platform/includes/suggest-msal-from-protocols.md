This article describes how to program directly against the protocol in your application to request tokens from Microsoft Entra ID. When possible, we recommend you use the supported Microsoft Authentication Libraries (MSAL) instead to [acquire tokens and call secured web APIs](../authentication-flows-app-scenarios.md#scenarios-and-supported-authentication-flows). For a list of code samples that use MSAL refer to the [Microsoft identity platform code samples](../sample-v2-code.md).

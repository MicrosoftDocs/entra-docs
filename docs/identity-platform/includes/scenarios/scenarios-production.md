## Enable logging

To help in debugging and authentication failure troubleshooting scenarios, the Microsoft Authentication Library provides built-in logging support. Logging in each library is covered in the following articles:

:::row:::
    :::column:::
        - [Logging in MSAL.NET](/entra/msal/dotnet/advanced/exceptions/msal-logging)
        - [Logging in MSAL for Android](../../msal-logging-android.md)
        - [Logging in MSAL.js](../../msal-logging-js.md)
    :::column-end:::
    :::column:::
        - [Logging in MSAL for iOS/macOS](/entra/msal/objc/logging-ios)
        - [Logging in MSAL for Java](/entra/msal/java/advanced/msal-logging-java)
        - [Logging in MSAL for Python](/entra/msal/python/advanced/msal-logging-python)
    :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

Here are some suggestions for data collection:

- Users might ask for help when they have problems. A best practice is to capture and temporarily store logs. Provide a location where users can upload the logs. MSAL provides logging extensions to capture detailed information about authentication.

- If telemetry is available, enable it through MSAL to gather data about how users sign in to your app.


## Validate your integration

Test your integration by following the [Microsoft identity platform integration checklist](../../identity-platform-integration-checklist.md).

## Build for resilience

Learn how to increase resiliency in your app. For details, see [Increase resilience of authentication and authorization applications you develop](~/architecture/resilience-app-development-overview.md)

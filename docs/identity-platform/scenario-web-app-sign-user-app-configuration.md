## Configuration files

Web applications that sign in users by using the Microsoft identity platform are configured through configuration files. Those files must specify the following values:

- The cloud **instance** if you want your app to run in national clouds, for example. The different options include;
  - `https://login.microsoftonline.com/` for Azure public cloud
  - `https://login.microsoftonline.us/` for Azure US government
  - `https://login.microsoftonline.de/` for Microsoft Entra Germany
  - `https://login.partner.microsoftonline.cn/common` for Microsoft Entra China operated by 21Vianet
- The audience in the **tenant ID**. The options vary depending on whether your app is single tenant or multitenant.
  - The tenant GUID obtained from the Azure portal to sign in users in your organization. You can also use a domain name.
  - `organizations` to sign in users in any work or school account
  - `common` to sign in users with any work or school account or Microsoft personal account
  - `consumers` to sign in users with a Microsoft personal account only
- The **client ID** for your application, as copied from the Azure portal

You might also see references to the **authority**, a concatenation of the **instance** and **tenant ID** values.

# [ASP.NET Core](#tab/aspnetcore)

In ASP.NET Core, these settings are located in the [appsettings.json](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-aspnetcore-webapp-openidconnect-v2/blob/bc564d68179c36546770bf4d6264ce72009bc65a/1-WebApp-OIDC/1-1-MyOrg/appsettings.json#L2-L8) file, in the "Microsoft Entra ID" section.

```Json
{
  "AzureAd": {
    "Instance": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/",
    "TenantId": "[Enter the tenantId here]",

    // Client ID (application ID) obtained from the Azure portal
    "ClientId": "[Enter the Client Id here]",
    "CallbackPath": "/signin-oidc",
    "SignedOutCallbackPath": "/signout-oidc"
  }
}
```

In ASP.NET Core, another file ([properties\launchSettings.json](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-aspnetcore-webapp-openidconnect-v2/blob/bc564d68179c36546770bf4d6264ce72009bc65a/1-WebApp-OIDC/1-1-MyOrg/Properties/launchSettings.json#L6-L7)) contains the URL (`applicationUrl`) and the TLS/SSL port (`sslPort`) for your application and various profiles.

```Json
{
  "iisSettings": {
    "windowsAuthentication": false,
    "anonymousAuthentication": true,
    "iisExpress": {
      "applicationUrl": "http://localhost:3110/",
      "sslPort": 44321
    }
  },
  "profiles": {
    "IIS Express": {
      "commandName": "IISExpress",
      "launchBrowser": true,
      "environmentVariables": {
        "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
      }
    },
    "webApp": {
      "commandName": "Project",
      "launchBrowser": true,
      "environmentVariables": {
        "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
      },
      "applicationUrl": "http://localhost:3110/"
    }
  }
}
```

In the Azure portal, the redirect URIs that you register on the **Authentication** page for your application need to match these URLs. For the two preceding configuration files, they would be `https://localhost:44321/signin-oidc`. The reason is that `applicationUrl` is `http://localhost:3110`, but `sslPort` is specified (`44321`). `CallbackPath` is `/signin-oidc`, as defined in `appsettings.json`.

In the same way, the sign-out URI would be set to `https://localhost:44321/signout-oidc`.
> [!NOTE]
> SignedOutCallbackPath should set either to portal or the application to avoid conflict while handling the event.

# [ASP.NET](#tab/aspnet)

In ASP.NET, the application is configured through the [appsettings.json](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-aspnet-webapp-openidconnect/blob/a2da310539aa613b77da1f9e1c17585311ab22b7/WebApp/Web.config#L12-L15) file, lines 12 to 15.

```json
{
  "AzureAd": {
    "Instance": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/",
    "TenantId": "[Enter the tenantId here]",
    "ClientId": "[Enter the Client Id here]",
  }
}
```

In the Azure portal, the reply URIs that you register on the **Authentication** page for your application need to match these URLs. That is, they should be `https://localhost:44326/`.

# [Java](#tab/java)

In Java, the configuration is located in the [application.properties](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-java-webapp/blob/d55ee4ac0ce2c43378f2c99fd6e6856d41bdf144/src/main/resources/application.properties) file located under `src/main/resources`.

```Java
aad.clientId=Enter_the_Application_Id_here
aad.authority=https://login.microsoftonline.com/Enter_the_Tenant_Info_Here/
aad.secretKey=Enter_the_Client_Secret_Here
aad.redirectUriSignin=http://localhost:8080/msal4jsample/secure/aad
aad.redirectUriGraph=http://localhost:8080/msal4jsample/graph/me
```

In the Azure portal, the reply URIs that you register on the **Authentication** page for your application need to match the `redirectUri` instances that the application defines. That is, they should be `http://localhost:8080/msal4jsample/secure/aad` and `http://localhost:8080/msal4jsample/graph/me`.

# [Node.js](#tab/nodejs)

Here, the configuration parameters reside in *.env.dev* as environment variables:

:::code language="text" source="~/../ms-identity-node/App/.env.dev":::

These parameters are used to create a configuration object in *authConfig.js* file, which will eventually be used to initialize MSAL Node:

:::code language="js" source="~/../ms-identity-node/App/authConfig.js":::

In the Azure portal, the reply URIs that you register on the Authentication page for your application need to match the redirectUri instances that the application defines (`http://localhost:3000/auth/redirect`).

For simplicity in this article, the client secret is stored in the configuration file. In the production app, consider using a key vault or an environment variable. An even better option is to use a certificate.

# [Python](#tab/python)

The configuration parameters are set in *.env* as environment variables:

:::code language="python" source="~/../ms-identity-python-webapp-tutorial/.env.sample" highlight="4,5,10":::


Those environment variables are referenced in *app_config.py*:

:::code language="python" source="~/../ms-identity-python-webapp-tutorial/app_config.py" highlight="4,6,10":::

The *.env* file should never be checked into source control, since it contains secrets. The quickstart sample includes a *.gitignore* file that prevents the *.env* file from being checked in.

:::code language="text" source="~/../ms-identity-python-webapp-tutorial/.gitignore" range="84-85" highlight="2":::

## Initialization code

The initialization code differences are platform dependent. For ASP.NET Core and ASP.NET, signing in users is delegated to the OpenID Connect middleware. The ASP.NET or ASP.NET Core template generates web applications for the Azure AD v1.0 endpoint. Some configuration is required to adapt them to the Microsoft identity platform. 

# [ASP.NET Core](#tab/aspnetcore)

In ASP.NET Core web apps (and web APIs), the application is protected because you have a `Authorize` attribute on the controllers or the controller actions. This attribute checks that the user is authenticated. Prior to the release of .NET 6, the code initialization was in the *Startup.cs* file.  New ASP.NET Core projects with .NET 6 no longer contain a *Startup.cs* file.  Taking its place is the *Program.cs* file.  The rest of this tutorial pertains to .NET 5 or lower.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to start directly with the new ASP.NET Core templates for Microsoft identity platform, that leverage Microsoft.Identity.Web, you can download a preview NuGet package containing project templates for .NET 5.0. Then, once installed, you can directly instantiate ASP.NET Core web applications (MVC or Blazor). See [Microsoft.Identity.Web web app project templates](https://aka.ms/ms-id-web/webapp-project-templates) for details. This is the simplest approach as it will do all the following steps for you.
>
> If you prefer to start your project with the current default ASP.NET Core web project within Visual Studio or by using `dotnet new mvc --auth SingleOrg` or `dotnet new webapp --auth SingleOrg`, you'll see code like the following:
>
> ```c#
>  services.AddAuthentication(AzureADDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
>          .AddAzureAD(options => Configuration.Bind("AzureAd", options));
> ```
>
> This code uses the legacy **Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureAD.UI** NuGet package which is used to create an Azure Active Directory v1.0 application. This article explains how to create a Microsoft identity platform v2.0 application which replaces that code.

1. Add the [Microsoft.Identity.Web](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Identity.Web) and [Microsoft.Identity.Web.UI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Identity.Web.UI) NuGet packages to your project. Remove the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureAD.UI` NuGet package if it's present.

2. Update the code in `ConfigureServices` so that it uses the `AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApp` and `AddMicrosoftIdentityUI` methods.

   ```c#
   public class Startup
   {
    ...
    // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to add services to the container.
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
     services.AddAuthentication(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
            .AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApp(Configuration, "AzureAd");

     services.AddRazorPages().AddMvcOptions(options =>
     {
      var policy = new AuthorizationPolicyBuilder()
                    .RequireAuthenticatedUser()
                    .Build();
      options.Filters.Add(new AuthorizeFilter(policy));
     }).AddMicrosoftIdentityUI();
    ```

3. In the `Configure` method in *Startup.cs*, enable authentication with a call to `app.UseAuthentication();` and `app.MapControllers();`.

   ```c#
   // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to configure the HTTP request pipeline.
   public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
   {
    // more code here
    app.UseAuthentication();
    app.UseAuthorization();
    
    app.MapRazorPages();
    app.MapControllers();
    // more code here
   }
   ```

In that code:
- The `AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApp` extension method is defined in **Microsoft.Identity.Web**, which;
  - Configures options to read the configuration file (here from the "Microsoft Entra ID" section)
  - Configures the OpenID Connect options so that the authority is the Microsoft identity platform.
  - Validates the issuer of the token.
  - Ensures that the claims corresponding to name are mapped from the `preferred_username` claim in the ID token.

- In addition to the configuration object, you can specify the name of the configuration section when calling `AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApp`. By default, it's `AzureAd`.

- `AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApp` has other parameters for advanced scenarios. For example, tracing OpenID Connect middleware events can help you troubleshoot your web application if authentication doesn't work. Setting the optional parameter `subscribeToOpenIdConnectMiddlewareDiagnosticsEvents` to `true` will show you how information is processed by the set of ASP.NET Core middleware as it progresses from the HTTP response to the identity of the user in `HttpContext.User`.

- The `AddMicrosoftIdentityUI` extension method is defined in **Microsoft.Identity.Web.UI**. It provides a default controller to handle sign-in and sign-out.

For more information about how Microsoft.Identity.Web enables you to create web apps, see [Web Apps in microsoft-identity-web](https://aka.ms/ms-id-web/webapp).

# [ASP.NET](#tab/aspnet)

The code related to authentication in an ASP.NET web app and web APIs is located in the [App_Start/Startup.Auth.cs](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-aspnet-webapp-openidconnect/blob/archive/WebApp/App_Start/Startup.Auth.cs) file.

```c#
 public void ConfigureAuth(IAppBuilder app)
 {
  app.SetDefaultSignInAsAuthenticationType(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationType);

  app.UseCookieAuthentication(new CookieAuthenticationOptions());

  OwinTokenAcquirerFactory factory = TokenAcquirerFactory.GetDefaultInstance<OwinTokenAcquirerFactory>();
  factory.Build();
  app.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApi(factory);
 }
```

# [Java](#tab/java)

The Java sample uses the Spring framework. The application is protected because you implement a filter, which intercepts each HTTP response. In the quickstart for Java web apps, this filter is `AuthFilter` in `src/main/java/com/microsoft/azure/msalwebsample/AuthFilter.java`.

The filter processes the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow and checks if the user is authenticated (`isAuthenticated()` method). If the user isn't authenticated, it computes the URL of the Microsoft Entra authorization endpoints, and redirects the browser to this URI.

When the response arrives, containing the authorization code, it acquires the token by using MSAL Java. When it finally receives the token from the token endpoint (on the redirect URI), the user is signed in.

For details, see the `doFilter()` method in [AuthFilter.java](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-java-webapp/blob/archive/msal-java-webapp-sample/src/main/java/com/microsoft/azure/msalwebsample/AuthFilter.java).

> [!NOTE]
> The code of the `doFilter()` is written in a slightly different order, but the flow is the one described.

For details about the authorization code flow that this method triggers, see the [Microsoft identity platform and OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow](v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow.md).

# [Node.js](#tab/nodejs)

The Node sample uses the Express framework. MSAL is initialized in *auth* route handler:

:::code language="js" source="~/../ms-identity-node/App/routes/auth.js" range="6-16":::

# [Python](#tab/python)

The Python sample is built with the Flask framework, though other frameworks like Django could be used as well. The Flask app is initialized with the app configuration at the top of *app.py*:

:::code language="python" source="~/../ms-identity-python-webapp-tutorial/app.py" range="1-12" highlight="10":::

Then the code constructs an [`auth` object](https://identity-library.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#identity.web.Auth) using the [identity package](https://pypi.org/project/identity/).

:::code language="python" source="~/../ms-identity-python-webapp-tutorial/app.py" range="20-25":::

# Configure a mobile app that calls web APIs

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-workforce-only](../external-id/includes/applies-to-workforce-only.md)]

After you create your application, you'll learn how to configure the code by using the app registration parameters. Mobile applications present some complexities related to fitting into their creation framework.

## Microsoft libraries supporting mobile apps

The following Microsoft libraries support mobile apps:

[!INCLUDE [develop-libraries-mobile](./includes/libraries/libraries-mobile.md)]

## Instantiate the application

### Android

Mobile applications use the `PublicClientApplication` class. Here's how to instantiate it:

```Java
PublicClientApplication sampleApp = new PublicClientApplication(
                    this.getApplicationContext(),
                    R.raw.auth_config);
```

### iOS

Mobile applications on iOS need to instantiate the `MSALPublicClientApplication` class. To instantiate the class, use the following code.

```objc
NSError *msalError = nil;

MSALPublicClientApplicationConfig *config = [[MSALPublicClientApplicationConfig alloc] initWithClientId:@"<your-client-id-here>"];
MSALPublicClientApplication *application = [[MSALPublicClientApplication alloc] initWithConfiguration:config error:&msalError];
```

```swift
let config = MSALPublicClientApplicationConfig(clientId: "<your-client-id-here>")
if let application = try? MSALPublicClientApplication(configuration: config){ /* Use application */}
```

[Additional MSALPublicClientApplicationConfig properties](https://azuread.github.io/microsoft-authentication-library-for-objc/Classes/MSALPublicClientApplicationConfig.html#/Configuration%20options) can override the default authority, specify a redirect URI, or change the behavior of MSAL token caching.

### UWP

This section explains how to instantiate the application for UWP apps.

#### Instantiate the application

In UWP, the simplest way to instantiate the application is by using the following code. In this code, `ClientId` is the GUID of your registered app.

```csharp
var app = PublicClientApplicationBuilder.Create(clientId)
                                        .Build();
```

Additional `With<Parameter>` methods set the UI parent, override the default authority, specify a client name and version for telemetry, specify a redirect URI, and specify the HTTP factory to use. The HTTP factory might be used, for instance, to handle proxies and to specify telemetry and logging.

The following sections provide more information about instantiating the application.

##### Specify the parent UI, window, or activity

On Android, pass the parent activity before you do the interactive authentication. On iOS, when you use a broker, pass-in `ViewController`. In the same way on UWP, you might want to pass-in the parent window. You pass it in when you acquire the token. But when you're creating the app, you can also specify a callback as a delegate that returns `UIParent`.

```csharp
IPublicClientApplication application = PublicClientApplicationBuilder.Create(clientId)
  .ParentActivityOrWindowFunc(() => parentUi)
  .Build();
```

On Android, we recommend that you use [`CurrentActivityPlugin`](https://github.com/jamesmontemagno/CurrentActivityPlugin). The resulting `PublicClientApplication` builder code looks like this example:

```csharp
// Requires MSAL.NET 4.2 or above
var pca = PublicClientApplicationBuilder
  .Create("<your-client-id-here>")
  .WithParentActivityOrWindow(() => CrossCurrentActivity.Current)
  .Build();
```

##### Find more app-building parameters

For a list of all methods that are available on `PublicClientApplicationBuilder`, see the [Methods list](/dotnet/api/microsoft.identity.client.publicclientapplicationbuilder#methods).

For a description of all options that are exposed in `PublicClientApplicationOptions`, see the [reference documentation](/dotnet/api/microsoft.identity.client.publicclientapplicationoptions).

## Tasks for MSAL for iOS and macOS

These tasks are necessary when you use MSAL for iOS and macOS:

* [Implement the `openURL` callback](#brokered-authentication-for-msal-for-ios-and-macos)
* [Enable keychain access groups](/entra/msal/objc/howto-v2-keychain-objc)
* [Customize browsers and WebViews](/entra/msal/objc/customize-webviews)

#### Tasks for UWP

On UWP, you can use corporate networks. The following sections explain the tasks that you should complete in the corporate scenario.

For more information, see [UWP-specific considerations with MSAL.NET](/entra/msal/dotnet/acquiring-tokens/desktop-mobile/uwp).

## Configure the application to use the broker

On Android and iOS, brokers enable:

- **Single sign-on (SSO)**: You can use SSO for devices that are registered with Microsoft Entra ID. When you use SSO, your users don't need to sign in to each application.
- **Device identification**: This setting enables conditional-access policies that are related to Microsoft Entra devices. The authentication process uses the device certificate that was created when the device was joined to the workplace.
- **Application identification verification**: When an application calls the broker, it passes its redirect URL. Then the broker verifies it.

### Enable the broker for MSAL for Android

For information about enabling a broker on Android, see [Brokered authentication on Android](msal-android-single-sign-on.md).

### Enable the broker for MSAL for iOS and macOS

Brokered authentication is enabled by default for Microsoft Entra scenarios in MSAL for iOS and macOS.

The following sections provide instructions to configure your application for brokered authentication support for iOS and macOS. In the two sets of instructions, some of the steps differ.

### Brokered authentication for MSAL for iOS and macOS

Brokered authentication is enabled by default for Microsoft Entra scenarios.

#### Step 1: Update AppDelegate to handle the callback

When MSAL for iOS and macOS calls the broker, the broker calls back to your application by using the `openURL` method. Because MSAL waits for the response from the broker, your application needs to cooperate to call back MSAL. Set up this capability by updating the `AppDelegate.m` file to override the method, as the following code examples show.

```objc
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)app
            openURL:(NSURL *)url
            options:(NSDictionary<UIApplicationOpenURLOptionsKey,id> *)options
{
    return [MSALPublicClientApplication handleMSALResponse:url
                                         sourceApplication:options[UIApplicationOpenURLOptionsSourceApplicationKey]];
}
```

```swift
    func application(_ app: UIApplication, open url: URL, options: [UIApplication.OpenURLOptionsKey : Any] = [:]) -> Bool {

        guard let sourceApplication = options[UIApplication.OpenURLOptionsKey.sourceApplication] as? String else {
            return false
        }

        return MSALPublicClientApplication.handleMSALResponse(url, sourceApplication: sourceApplication)
    }
```

If you adopted `UISceneDelegate` on iOS 13 or later, then place the MSAL callback into the `scene:openURLContexts:` of `UISceneDelegate` instead. MSAL `handleMSALResponse:sourceApplication:` must be called only once for each URL.

For more information, see the [Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiscenedelegate/3238059-scene?language=objc).

#### Step 2: Register a URL scheme

MSAL for iOS and macOS uses URLs to invoke the broker and then return the broker response to your app. To finish the round trip, register a URL scheme for your app in the `Info.plist` file.

To register a scheme for your app:

1. Prefix your custom URL scheme with `msauth`.

1. Add your bundle identifier to the end of your scheme. Follow this pattern:

   `$"msauth.(BundleId)"`

   Here, `BundleId` uniquely identifies your device. For example, if `BundleId` is `yourcompany.xforms`, your URL scheme is `msauth.com.yourcompany.xforms`.

    This URL scheme will become part of the redirect URI that uniquely identifies your app when it receives the broker's response. Make sure that the redirect URI in the format `msauth.(BundleId)://auth` is registered for your application.

   ```xml
   <key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
   <array>
       <dict>
           <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
           <array>
               <string>msauth.[BUNDLE_ID]</string>
           </array>
       </dict>
   </array>
   ```

#### Step 3: Add LSApplicationQueriesSchemes

Add `LSApplicationQueriesSchemes` to allow calls to the Microsoft Authenticator app, if it's installed.

> [!NOTE]
> The `msauthv3` scheme is needed when your app is compiled by using Xcode 11 and later.

Here's an example of how to add `LSApplicationQueriesSchemes`:

```xml
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
  <string>msauthv2</string>
  <string>msauthv3</string>
</array>
```

#Customer intent: As a developer integrating OAuth 2.0 into my application, I want to understand how to implement the device authorization grant flow, so that users can sign in to input-constrained devices and obtain access tokens and refresh tokens for accessing secured web APIs.

# Microsoft identity platform and the OAuth 2.0 device authorization grant flow

The Microsoft identity platform supports the [device authorization grant](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628), which allows users to sign in to input-constrained devices such as a smart TV, IoT device, or a printer. To enable this flow, the device has the user visit a webpage in a browser on another device to sign in. Once the user signs in, the device is able to get access tokens and refresh tokens as needed.

This article describes how to program directly against the protocol in your application.  When possible, we recommend you use the supported Microsoft Authentication Libraries (MSAL) instead to [acquire tokens and call secured web APIs](authentication-flows-app-scenarios.md#scenarios-and-supported-authentication-flows). You can refer to [sample apps that use MSAL](sample-v2-code.md) for examples.

## Protocol diagram

The entire device code flow is shown in the following diagram. Each step is explained throughout this article.

![Device code flow](./media/v2-oauth2-device-code/v2-oauth-device-flow.svg)

## Device authorization request

The client must first check with the authentication server for a device and user code used to initiate authentication. The client collects this request from the `/devicecode` endpoint. In the request, the client should also include the permissions it needs to acquire from the user. 

From the moment the request is sent, the user has 15 minutes to sign in. This is the default value for `expires_in`. The request should only be made when the user indicates they're ready to sign in.

```HTTP
// Line breaks are for legibility only.

POST https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/oauth2/v2.0/devicecode
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

client_id=00001111-aaaa-2222-bbbb-3333cccc4444
&scope=user.read%20openid%20profile

```

| Parameter | Condition | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tenant` | Required | Can be `/common`, `/consumers`, or `/organizations`. It can also be the directory tenant that you want to request permission from in GUID or friendly name format.  |
| `client_id` | Required | The **Application (client) ID** that the [Microsoft Entra admin center â€“ App registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) experience assigned to your app. |
| `scope` | Required | A space-separated list of [scopes](./permissions-consent-overview.md) that you want the user to consent to.  |

### Device authorization response

A successful response is a JSON object containing the required information to allow the user to sign in.

| Parameter | Format | Description |
| ---              | --- | --- |
|`device_code`     | String | A long string used to verify the session between the client and the authorization server. The client uses this parameter to request the access token from the authorization server. |
|`user_code`       | String | A short string shown to the user used to identify the session on a secondary device.|
|`verification_uri`| URI | The URI the user should go to with the `user_code` in order to sign in. |
|`expires_in`      | int | The number of seconds before the `device_code` and `user_code` expire. |
|`interval`        | int | The number of seconds the client should wait between polling requests. |
| `message`        | String | A human-readable string with instructions for the user. This can be localized by including a **query parameter** in the request of the form `?mkt=xx-XX`, filling in the appropriate language culture code. |

> [!NOTE]
> The `verification_uri_complete` response field is not included or supported at this time.  We mention this because if you read the [standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628) you see that `verification_uri_complete` is listed as an optional part of the device code flow standard.

## Authenticating the user

After the client receives `user_code` and `verification_uri`, the values are displayed and the user is directed to sign in via their mobile or PC browser.

If the user authenticates with a personal account, using `/common` or `/consumers`, they're asked to sign in again in order to transfer authentication state to the device. This is because the device is unable to access the user's cookies. They're asked to consent to the permissions requested by the client. However, this doesn't apply to work or school accounts used to authenticate. 

While the user is authenticating at the `verification_uri`, the client should be polling the `/token` endpoint for the requested token using the `device_code`.

```HTTP
POST https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/oauth2/v2.0/token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code&client_id=00001111-aaaa-2222-bbbb-3333cccc4444&device_code=GMMhmHCXhWEzkobqIHGG_EnNYYsAkukHspeYUk9E8...
```

| Parameter | Required | Description|
| -------- | -------- | ---------- |
| `tenant`  | Required | The same tenant or tenant alias used in the initial request. |
| `grant_type` | Required | Must be `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code`|
| `client_id`  | Required | Must match the `client_id` used in the initial request. |
| `device_code`| Required | The `device_code` returned in the device authorization request.  |

### Expected errors

The device code flow is a polling protocol so errors served to the client must be expected prior to completion of user authentication.

| Error | Description | Client Action |
| ------ | ----------- | -------------|
| `authorization_pending` | The user hasn't finished authenticating, but hasn't canceled the flow. | Repeat the request after at least `interval` seconds. |
| `authorization_declined` | The end user denied the authorization request.| Stop polling and revert to an unauthenticated state.  |
| `bad_verification_code`| The `device_code` sent to the `/token` endpoint wasn't recognized. | Verify that the client is sending the correct `device_code` in the request. |
| `expired_token` | Value of `expires_in` has been exceeded and authentication is no longer possible with `device_code`. | Stop polling and revert to an unauthenticated state. |

### Successful authentication response

A successful token response looks like:

```json
{
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "scope": "User.Read profile openid email",
    "expires_in": 3599,
    "access_token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsIng1dCI6Ik5HVEZ2ZEstZnl0aEV1Q...",
    "refresh_token": "AwABAAAAvPM1KaPlrEqdFSBzjqfTGAMxZGUTdM0t4B4...",
    "id_token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJub25lIn0.eyJhdWQiOiIyZDRkMTFhMi1mODE0LTQ2YTctOD..."
}
```

| Parameter | Format | Description |
| --------- | ------ | ----------- |
| `token_type` | String| Always `Bearer`. |
| `scope` | Space separated strings | If an access token was returned, this lists the scopes in which the access token is valid for. |
| `expires_in`| int | Number of seconds the included access token is valid for. |
| `access_token`| Opaque string | Issued for the [scopes](./permissions-consent-overview.md) that were requested.  |
| `id_token`   | JWT | Issued if the original `scope` parameter included the `openid` scope.  |
| `refresh_token` | Opaque string | Issued if the original `scope` parameter included `offline_access`.  |

You can use the refresh token to acquire new access tokens and refresh tokens using the same flow documented in the [OAuth Code flow documentation](v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow.md#refresh-the-access-token).

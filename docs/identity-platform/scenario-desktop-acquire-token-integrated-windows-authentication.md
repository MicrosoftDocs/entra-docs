# Desktop app that calls web APIs: Acquire a token using integrated Windows authentication

To sign in a domain user on a domain or Microsoft Entra joined machine, use integrated Windows authentication (IWA).

## Constraints

- Integrated Windows authentication is available for *federated+* users only, that is, users created in Active Directory and backed by Microsoft Entra ID. Users created directly in Microsoft Entra ID without Active Directory backing, known as *managed* users, can't use this authentication flow. This limitation doesn't affect the username and password flow.
- IWA doesn't bypass [multifactor authentication (MFA)](~/identity/authentication/concept-mfa-howitworks.md). If MFA is configured, IWA might fail if an MFA challenge is required, because MFA requires user interaction.

    IWA is non-interactive, but MFA requires user interactivity. You don't control when the identity provider requests MFA to be performed, the tenant admin does. From our observations, MFA is required when you sign in from a different country/region, when not connected via VPN to a corporate network, and sometimes even when connected via VPN. Don't expect a deterministic set of rules. Microsoft Entra ID uses AI to continuously learn if MFA is required. Fall back to a user prompt like interactive authentication or device code flow if IWA fails.

- The authority passed in `PublicClientApplicationBuilder` needs to be:
  - Tenanted of the form `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/`, where `tenant` is either the GUID that represents the tenant ID or a domain associated with the tenant.
  - For any work and school accounts: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/organizations/`.
  - Microsoft personal accounts aren't supported. You can't use /common or /consumers tenants.

- Because integrated Windows authentication is a silent flow:
  - The user of your application must have previously consented to use the application.
  - Or, the tenant admin must have previously consented to all users in the tenant to use the application.
  - In other words:
    - Either you as a developer selected the **Grant** button in the Azure portal for yourself.
    - Or, a tenant admin selected the **Grant/revoke admin consent for {tenant domain}** button on the **API permissions** tab of the registration for the application. For more information, see [Add permissions to access your web API](quickstart-configure-app-access-web-apis.md#add-permissions-to-access-your-web-api).
    - Or, you've provided a way for users to consent to the application. For more information, see [Requesting individual user consent](./permissions-consent-overview.md#user-consent).
    - Or, you've provided a way for the tenant admin to consent to the application. For more information, see [Admin consent](./permissions-consent-overview.md#administrator-consent).

- This flow is enabled for .NET desktop, .NET, and UWP apps.

For more information on consent, see the [Microsoft identity platform permissions and consent](./permissions-consent-overview.md).

## Learn how to use it

# [.NET](#tab/dotnet)

In MSAL.NET, use:

```csharp
AcquireTokenByIntegratedWindowsAuth(IEnumerable<string> scopes)
```

You normally need only one parameter (`scopes`). Depending on the way your Windows administrator set up the policies, applications on your Windows machine might not be allowed to look up the signed-in user. In that case, use a second method, `.WithUsername()`, and pass in the username of the signed-in user as a UPN format, for example, `joe@contoso.com`.

The following sample presents the most current case, with explanations of the kind of exceptions you can get and their mitigations.

```csharp
static async Task GetATokenForGraph()
{
 string authority = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/contoso.com";
 string[] scopes = new string[] { "user.read" };
 IPublicClientApplication app = PublicClientApplicationBuilder
      .Create(clientId)
      .WithAuthority(authority)
      .Build();

 var accounts = await app.GetAccountsAsync();

 AuthenticationResult result = null;
 if (accounts.Any())
 {
  result = await app.AcquireTokenSilent(scopes, accounts.FirstOrDefault())
      .ExecuteAsync();
 }
 else
 {
  try
  {
   result = await app.AcquireTokenByIntegratedWindowsAuth(scopes)
      .ExecuteAsync(CancellationToken.None);
  }
  catch (MsalUiRequiredException ex)
  {
   // MsalUiRequiredException: AADSTS65001: The user or administrator has not consented to use the application
   // with ID '{appId}' named '{appName}'.Send an interactive authorization request for this user and resource.

   // you need to get user consent first. This can be done, if you are not using .NET (which does not have any Web UI)
   // by doing (once only) an AcquireToken interactive.

   // If you are using .NET or don't want to do an AcquireTokenInteractive, you might want to suggest the user to navigate
   // to a URL to consent: https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?client_id={clientId}&response_type=code&scope=user.read

   // AADSTS50079: The user is required to use multi-factor authentication.
   // There is no mitigation - if MFA is configured for your tenant and AAD decides to enforce it,
   // you need to fallback to an interactive flows such as AcquireTokenInteractive or AcquireTokenByDeviceCode
   }
   catch (MsalServiceException ex)
   {
    // Kind of errors you could have (in ex.Message)

    // MsalServiceException: AADSTS90010: The grant type is not supported over the /common or /consumers endpoints. Please use the /organizations or tenant-specific endpoint.
    // you used common.
    // Mitigation: as explained in the message from Azure AD, the authority needs to be tenanted or otherwise organizations

    // MsalServiceException: AADSTS70002: The request body must contain the following parameter: 'client_secret or client_assertion'.
    // Explanation: this can happen if your application was not registered as a public client application in Azure AD
    // Mitigation: in the Azure portal, edit the manifest for your application and set the `allowPublicClient` to `true`
   }
   catch (MsalClientException ex)
   {
      // Error Code: unknown_user Message: Could not identify logged in user
      // Explanation: the library was unable to query the current Windows logged-in user or this user is not AD or AAD
      // joined (work-place joined users are not supported).

      // Mitigation 1: on UWP, check that the application has the following capabilities: Enterprise Authentication,
      // Private Networks (Client and Server), User Account Information

      // Mitigation 2: Implement your own logic to fetch the username (e.g. john@contoso.com) and use the
      // AcquireTokenByIntegratedWindowsAuth form that takes in the username

      // Error Code: integrated_windows_auth_not_supported_managed_user
      // Explanation: This method relies on a protocol exposed by Active Directory (AD). If a user was created in Azure
      // Active Directory without AD backing ("managed" user), this method will fail. Users created in AD and backed by
      // AAD ("federated" users) can benefit from this non-interactive method of authentication.
      // Mitigation: Use interactive authentication
   }
 }

 Console.WriteLine(result.Account.Username);
}
```

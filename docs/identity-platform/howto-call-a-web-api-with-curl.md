# Call an ASP.NET Core web API with cURL

::: zone pivot="no-api" 

This article shows you how to call a protected ASP.NET Core web API using Client URL (cURL). cURL is a command line tool that developers use to transfer data to and from a server. In this article, you register a web app and a web API in a tenant. The web app is used to get an access token generated by the Microsoft identity platform. Next, you use the token to make an authorized call to the web API using cURL.

## Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform

The Microsoft identity platform requires your application to be registered before providing identity and access management services. The application registration allows you to specify the name, and type of the application, and the sign-in audience. The sign-in audience specifies what types of user accounts are allowed to sign-in to a given application.

### Register the web API 

[!INCLUDE [portal updates](~/includes/portal-update.md)]

Follow these steps to create the web API registration:  

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least an [Application Developer](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#application-developer).
1. If you have access to multiple tenants, use the **Settings** icon :::image type="icon" source="media/common/admin-center-settings-icon.png" border="false"::: in the top menu to switch to the tenant in which you want to register the application from the **Directories + subscriptions** menu.
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **App registrations**.
1. Select **New registration**.  
1. Enter a **Name** for the application, such as *NewWebAPI1*.  
1. For **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**. For information on different account types, select **Help me choose** option.  
1. Select **Register**.  

   :::image type="content" source="./media/web-api-tutorial-01-register-app/register-application.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to enter a name and select the account type."::: 

1. The application's **Overview** pane is displayed when registration is complete. Record the **Directory (tenant) ID** and the **Application (client) ID** to be used in your application source code.  

   :::image type="content" source="./media/web-api-tutorial-01-register-app/record-identifiers.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the identifier values on the overview page."::: 

> [!NOTE]
> The **Supported account types** can be changed by referring to [Modify the accounts supported by an application](howto-modify-supported-accounts.md).  

#### Expose the API 

Once the API is registered, you can configure its permission by defining the scopes that the API exposes to client applications. Client applications request permission to perform operations by passing an access token along with its requests to the protected web API. The web API then performs the requested operation only if the access token it receives is valid. 

1. Under **Manage**, select **Expose an API > Add a scope**. Accept the proposed **Application ID URI** `(api://{clientId})` by selecting **Save and continue**. The `{clientId}` is the value recorded from the **Overview** page. Then enter the following information: 
   1. For **Scope name**, enter `Forecast.Read`. 
   1. For **Who can consent**, ensure that the **Admins and users** option is selected. 
   1. In the **Admin consent display name** box, enter `Read forecast data`. 
   1. In the **Admin consent description** box, enter `Allows the application to read weather forecast data`. 
   1. In the **User consent display name** box, enter `Read forecast data`. 
   1. In the **User consent description** box, enter `Allows the application to read weather forecast data`. 
   1. Ensure that the **State** is set to **Enabled**.
1. Select **Add scope**. If the scope has been entered correctly, it'll be listed in the **Expose an API** pane.  

   :::image type="content" source="./media/web-api-tutorial-01-register-app/add-a-scope.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the field values when adding the scope to an API." lightbox="./media/web-api-tutorial-01-register-app/add-a-scope.png":::

### Register the web app

Having a web API isn't enough however, as a web app is also needed to obtain an access token to access the web API you've created.

Follow these steps to create the web app registration:  

::: zone pivot="no-api"

1. Select **Home** to return to the home page. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **App registrations**.
1. Select **New registration**.
1. Enter a **Name** for the application, such as `web-app-calls-web-api`. 
1. For **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**. For information on different account types, select the **Help me choose** option. 
1. Under **Redirect URI (optional)**, select **Web**, and then enter `http://localhost` in the URL text box.
1. Select **Register**.  

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="api"

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least an [Application Developer](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#application-developer).
1. If you have access to multiple tenants, use the **Settings** icon :::image type="icon" source="media/common/admin-center-settings-icon.png" border="false"::: in the top menu to switch to the tenant in which you want to register the application from the **Directories + subscriptions** menu.
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **App registrations**.
1. Select **New registration**.  
1. Enter a Name for the application, such as `web-app-calls-web-api`. 
1. For **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**. For information on different account types, select the **Help me choose** option. 
1. Under **Redirect URI (optional)**, select **Web**, and then enter `http://localhost` in the URL text box.
1. Select **Register**.  

::: zone-end

When registration is complete, the app registration is displayed on the **Overview** pane. Record the **Directory (tenant) ID** and the **Application (client) ID** to be used in later steps.  

#### Add a client secret  

A client secret is a string value your app can use to identity itself, and is sometimes referred to as an *application password*. The web app uses the client secret to prove its identity when it requests tokens.  

Follow these steps to configure a client secret:  

1. From the **Overview** pane, under **Manage**, select **Certificates & secrets** > **Client secrets** > **New client secret**.  
1. Add a description for your client secret, for example *My client secret*. 
1. Select an expiration for the secret or specify a custom lifetime.  

   - A client secret's lifetime is limited to two years (24 months) or less. You can't specify a custom lifetime longer than 24 months. 
   - Microsoft recommends that you set an expiration value of less than 12 months.  

1. Select **Add**.  
1. Be sure to record the **Value** of the client secret. This secret value is **never displayed again** after you leave this page. 

#### Add application permissions to allow access to a web API  

By specifying a web API's scopes in the web app registration, the web app can obtain an access token containing the scopes provided by the Microsoft identity platform. Within the code, the web API can then provide permission-based access to its resources based on the scopes found in the access token.  

Follow these steps to configure the web app permissions to the web API:  

1. From the **Overview** pane of your web application (*web-app-that-calls-web-api*), under **Manage**, select **API permissions** > **Add a permission** > **APIs my organization uses**.  
1. Select **NewWebAPI1** or the API that you wish to add permissions to. 
1. Under **Select permissions**, check the box next to **Forecast.Read**. You may need to expand the **Permission** list. This selects the permissions the client app should have on behalf of the signed-in user.  
1. Select **Add permissions** to complete the process.  

After adding these permissions to your API, you should see the selected permissions under **Configured permissions**.  

You may also notice the **User.Read** permission for the Microsoft Graph API. This permission is added automatically when you register an app.

## Test the web API

1. Clone the [ms-identity-docs-code-dotnet](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-docs-code-dotnet) repository.  

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-docs-code-dotnet.git 
   ``` 

1. Navigate to `ms-identity-docs-code-dotnet/web-api` folder and open `./appsettings.json` file, replace the `{APPLICATION_CLIENT_ID}` and `{DIRECTORY_TENANT_ID}` with:  

   - `{APPLICATION_CLIENT_ID}` is the web API **Application (client) ID** on the app's **Overview** pane **App registrations**.  
   - `{DIRECTORY_TENANT_ID}` is the web API **Directory (tenant) ID** on the app's **Overview** pane **App registrations**.  

1. Execute the following command to start the app:  

   ### [.NET 6.0](#tab/dotnet6)
    
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ``` 
    
    ### [.NET 7.0](#tab/dotnet7)
   
   ```bash
   dotnet run --launch-profile https
   ``` 

1. An output similar to the following will appear. Record the port number in the `https://localhost:{port}` URL. 

   ```bash
   ... 
   info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14]
         Now listening on: https://localhost:{port}
   ...
   ``` 

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="api"

## Test the web API

1. Navigate to the web API that was created in [Tutorial: Create an ASP.NET Core project and configure the API](web-api-tutorial-02-prepare-api.md), for example *NewWebAPILocal*, and open the folder. 

1. Open a new terminal window and navigate to the folder where the web API project is located.

### [.NET 6.0](#tab/dotnet6)
    
1. Execute the following command to start the app: 
    
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ``` 
    
### [.NET 7.0](#tab/dotnet7)
    
1. Execute the following command to start the app on the `https` profile: 
       
   ```bash
   dotnet run --launch-profile https
   ``` 
---

1. An output similar to the following will appear. Record the port number in the `https://localhost:{port}` URL. 

   ```bash
   ... 
   info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14]
         Now listening on: https://localhost:{port}
   ...
   ``` 

::: zone-end

### Request an authorization code

The authorization code flow begins with the client directing the user to the `/authorize` endpoint. In this request, the client requests the `Forecast.Read` permission from the user.  

   ```http
   https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant_id}/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?client_id={web-app-calls-web-api_application_client_id}&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http://localhost&response_mode=query&scope=api://{web_API_application_client_id}/Forecast.Read
   ``` 

1. Copy the URL, replace the following parameters and paste it into your browser: 
   - `{tenant_id}` is the web app **Directory (tenant) ID**.  
   - `{web-app-calls-web-api_application_client_id}` is the **Application (client) ID** on the web app's (*web-app-calls-web-api*) **Overview** pane.
   - `{web_API_application_client_id}` is the **Application (client) ID** on the web API's (*NewWebAPI1*) **Overview** pane.
1. Sign in as a user in the Microsoft Entra tenant in which the apps are registered. Consent to any requests for access, if necessary.  
1. Your browser will be redirected to `http://localhost/`. Refer to your browser's navigation bar and copy the `{authorization_code}` to use in the following steps. The URL takes the form of the following snippet:  

   ```http
   http://localhost/?code={authorization_code}
   ```     

### Use an authorization code and cURL to get an access token  

cURL can now be used to request an access token from the Microsoft identity platform. 

1. Copy the cURL command in the following snippet. Replace the values in parentheses with the following parameters to your terminal. Be sure to remove the parentheses: 

   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant_id}/oauth2/v2.0/token \
   -d 'client_id={web-app-calls-web-api_application_client_id}' \
   -d 'api://{web_API_application_client_id}/Forecast.Read' \
   -d 'code={authorization_code}&session_state={web-app-calls-web-api_application_client_id}' \
   -d 'redirect_uri=http://localhost' \
   -d 'grant_type=authorization_code' \
   -d 'client_secret={client_secret}'
   ``` 
   - `{tenant_id}` is the web app **Directory (tenant) ID**.
   - `client_id={web-app-calls-web-api_application_client_id}`, and `session_state={web-app-calls-web-api_application_client_id}` is the **Application (client) ID** on the web application's (*web-app-calls-web-api*) **Overview** pane. 
   - `api://{web_API_application_client_id}/Forecast.Read` is the **Application (client) ID** on the web API's (*NewWebAPI1*) **Overview** pane. 
   - `code={authorization_code}` is the authorization code that was received in [Request an authorization code](#request-an-authorization-code). This enables the cURL tool to request an access token. 
   - `client_secret={client_secret}` is the client secret **Value** recorded in [Add a client secret](#add-a-client-secret). 
   
1. Run the cURL command and if entered correctly, you should receive a JSON response similar to the following output: 

   ```json
   {
      "token_type": "Bearer",
      "scope": "api://{web_API_application_client_id}/Forecast.Read",
      "expires_in": 3600,
      "ext_expires_in": 3600,
      "access_token": "{access_token}"
   }
   ``` 

### Call web API with access token  

By running the previous cURL command, the Microsoft identity platform has provided an access token. The acquired token can now be used as a bearer in an HTTP request to call the web API. 

1. To call the web API, copy the following cURL command, replace the following values in parentheses and paste it into your terminal:  

   ```bash
   curl -X GET https://localhost:{port}/weatherforecast -ki \
   -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}"
   ``` 

   - `{access_token}` the access token value recorded from the JSON output in the previous section. 
   - `{port}` the port number from the web API recorded when running the API in the terminal. Ensure it's the `https` port number. 

1. With a valid access token included in the request, the expected response is `HTTP/2 200` with output similar to the following output:  

   ```bash
   HTTP/2 200
   content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8
   date: Day, DD Month YYYY HH:MM:SS
   server: Kestrel
   [{"date":"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS","temperatureC":36,"summary":"Hot","temperatureF":96},{"date":"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS","temperatureC":43,"summary":"Warm","temperatureF":109},{"date":"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS","temperatureC":18,"summary":"Warm","temperatureF":64},{"date":"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS","temperatureC":50,"summary":"Chilly","temperatureF":121},{"date":"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS","temperatureC":3,"summary":"Bracing","temperatureF":37}]
   ```

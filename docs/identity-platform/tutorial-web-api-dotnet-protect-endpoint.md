# Tutorial: Implement a protected endpoint to your API

In this tutorial, you learn how to protect an API endpoint by adding authentication elements to the source code. Protecting an API endpoint ensures that only authorized users are permitted access. You can test the API with an unauthenticated request to ensure that your API restricts access to unauthorized users. The Microsoft identity platform provides a way to protect API endpoints by using the [Microsoft.Identity.Web](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Identity.Web/) NuGet package. In this article, you;

## Prerequisites

* Completion of the prerequisites and steps in [Tutorial: Create and configure an ASP.NET Core project for authentication](web-api-tutorial-02-prepare-api.md).

## Implement authorization

1. Open the *Program.cs* file and replace the contents with the following snippet:

    ```csharp
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
    using Microsoft.Identity.Web;

    var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
    builder.Services.AddAuthentication(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
            .AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApi(options =>
            {
                builder.Configuration.Bind("AzureAd", options);
                options.TokenValidationParameters.NameClaimType = "name";
            }, options => { builder.Configuration.Bind("AzureAd", options); });

        builder.Services.AddAuthorization(config =>
        {
            config.AddPolicy("AuthZPolicy", policyBuilder =>
                policyBuilder.Requirements.Add(new ScopeAuthorizationRequirement() { RequiredScopesConfigurationKey = $"AzureAd:Scopes" }));
        });

    // Add services to the container.
    builder.Services.AddRazorPages();

    var app = builder.Build();

    app.UseAuthentication();
    app.UseAuthorization();

    var weatherSummaries = new[]
        {
            "Freezing", "Bracing", "Chilly", "Cool", "Mild", "Warm", "Balmy", "Hot", "Sweltering", "Scorching"
        };

    app.MapGet("/weatherforecast", [Authorize(Policy = "AuthZPolicy")] () =>
        {
            var forecast = Enumerable.Range(1, 5).Select(index =>
                new WeatherForecast
                (
                    DateTime.Now.AddDays(index),
                    Random.Shared.Next(-20, 55),
                    weatherSummaries[Random.Shared.Next(weatherSummaries.Length)]
                ))
                .ToArray();
            return forecast;
        })
        .WithName("GetWeatherForecast");

    // Configure the HTTP request pipeline.
    if (!app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
    {
        app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error");
        // The default HSTS value is 30 days. You may want to change this for production scenarios, see https://aka.ms/aspnetcore-hsts.
        app.UseHsts();
    }

    app.UseHttpsRedirection();
    app.UseStaticFiles();

    app.UseRouting();

    app.UseAuthorization();

    app.MapRazorPages();

    app.Run();

    record WeatherForecast(DateTime Date, int TemperatureC, string? Summary)
    {
        public int TemperatureF => 32 + (int)(TemperatureC / 0.5556);
    } 
    ```

## Test the application

### [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio)

1. In Visual Studio, select **Start without debugging**.

### [Visual Studio Code](#tab/visual-studio-code)

1. Start the application by typing the following in the terminal:

    ```powershell
    dotnet run
    ```

1. A similar output to the following should be displayed in the terminal. This confirms that the application is running on `http://localhost:{port}` and listening for requests.

    ```powershell
    Building...
    info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
        Now listening on: http://localhost:{port}
    info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
        Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.
    ...
    ```

### [Visual Studio for Mac](#tab/visual-studio-for-mac)

1. Start the application by selecting **Play the executing solution**.

>[!NOTE]
> Visual Studio for Mac is scheduled for retirement by August 31, 2024 in accordance with Microsoftâ€™s [Modern Lifecycle Policy](/lifecycle/policies/modern). Visual Studio for Mac 17.6 will continue to be supported until August 31, 2024, with servicing updates for security issues and updated platforms from Apple.
> Refer to [What's happening to Visual Studio for Mac](/visualstudio/mac/what-happened-to-vs-for-mac) for more information.

The web page `http://localhost:{host}` displays an output similar to the following image. This is because the API is being called without authentication. In order to make an authorized call, refer to [Next steps](#next-steps) for how-to guides on how to access a protected web API.

> The sample app starts on the **Single Account Mode** screen. A default scope, **user.read**, is provided by default, which is used when reading your own profile data during the Microsoft Graph API call. The URL for the Microsoft Graph API call is provided by default. You can change both of these if you wish.

> Use the app menu to change between single and multiple account modes.
> 
> In single account mode, sign in using a work or home account:
> 
> 1. Select **Get graph data interactively** to prompt the user for their credentials. You'll see the output from the call to the Microsoft Graph API in the bottom of the screen.
> 2. Once signed in, select **Get graph data silently** to make a call to the Microsoft Graph API without prompting the user for credentials again. You'll see the output from the call to the Microsoft Graph API in the bottom of the screen.
> 
> In multiple account mode, you can repeat the same steps.  Additionally, you can remove the signed-in account, which also removes the cached tokens for that account.

> ### Adding MSAL to the app
> 
> MSAL ([com.microsoft.identity.client](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.microsoft.identity.client/msal)) is the library used to sign in users and request tokens used to access an API protected by Microsoft identity platform. Gradle 3.0+ installs the library when you add the following to **Gradle Scripts** > **build.gradle (Module: app)** under **Dependencies**:
> 
> ```java
> dependencies {
>     ...
>     implementation 'com.microsoft.identity.client:msal:2.+'
>     ...
> }
> ```
> 
> This instructs Gradle to download and build MSAL from maven central.
> 
> You must also add references to maven to the **allprojects** > **repositories** portion of the **build.gradle (Module: app)** like so:
> 
> ```java
> allprojects {
>     repositories {
>         mavenCentral()
>         google()
>         mavenLocal()
>         maven {
>             url 'https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/MicrosoftDeviceSDK/DuoSDK-Public/_packaging/Duo-SDK-Feed/maven/v1'
>         }
>         maven {
>             name "vsts-maven-adal-android"
>             url "https://identitydivision.pkgs.visualstudio.com/_packaging/AndroidADAL/maven/v1"
>             credentials {
>                 username System.getenv("ENV_VSTS_MVN_ANDROIDADAL_USERNAME") != null ? System.getenv("ENV_VSTS_MVN_ANDROIDADAL_USERNAME") : project.findProperty("vstsUsername")
>                 password System.getenv("ENV_VSTS_MVN_ANDROIDADAL_ACCESSTOKEN") != null ? System.getenv("ENV_VSTS_MVN_ANDROIDADAL_ACCESSTOKEN") : project.findProperty("vstsMavenAccessToken")
>             }
>         }
>         jcenter()
>     }
> }
> ```
> 
> ### MSAL imports
> 
> The imports that are relevant to the MSAL library are `com.microsoft.identity.client.*`.  For example, you'll see `import > com.microsoft.identity.client.PublicClientApplication;` which is the namespace for the `PublicClientApplication` class, which represents your public client application.
> 
> ### SingleAccountModeFragment.java
> 
> This file demonstrates how to create a single account MSAL app and call a Microsoft Graph API.
> 
> Single account apps are only used by a single user.  For example, you might just have one account that you sign into your mapping app with.
> 
> #### Single account MSAL initialization
> 
> In `auth_config_single_account.json`, in `onCreateView()`, a single account `PublicClientApplication` is created using the config information stored in the `auth_config_single_account.json` file.  This is how you initialize the MSAL library for use in a single-account MSAL app:
> 
> ```java
> ...
> // Creates a PublicClientApplication object with res/raw/auth_config_single_account.json
> PublicClientApplication.createSingleAccountPublicClientApplication(getContext(),
>         R.raw.auth_config_single_account,
>         new IPublicClientApplication.ISingleAccountApplicationCreatedListener() {
>             @Override
>             public void onCreated(ISingleAccountPublicClientApplication application) {
>                 /**
>                  * This test app assumes that the app is only going to support one account.
>                  * This requires "account_mode" : "SINGLE" in the config json file.
>                  **/
>                 mSingleAccountApp = application;
>                 loadAccount();
>             }
> 
>             @Override
>             public void onError(MsalException exception) {
>                 displayError(exception);
>             }
>         });
> ```
> 
> #### Sign in a user
> 
> In `SingleAccountModeFragment.java`, the code to sign in a user is in `initializeUI()`, in the `signInButton` click handler.
> 
> Call `signIn()` before trying to acquire tokens. `signIn()` behaves as though `acquireToken()` is called, resulting in an interactive prompt for the user to sign in.
> 
> Signing in a user is an asynchronous operation. A callback is passed that calls the Microsoft Graph API and update the UI once the user signs in:
> 
> ```java
> mSingleAccountApp.signIn(getActivity(), null, getScopes(), getAuthInteractiveCallback());
> ```
> 
> #### Sign out a user
> 
> In `SingleAccountModeFragment.java`, the code to sign out a user is in `initializeUI()`, in the `signOutButton` click handler.  Signing a user out is an asynchronous operation. Signing the user out also clears the token cache for that account. A callback is created to update the UI once the user account is signed out:
> 
> ```java
> mSingleAccountApp.signOut(new ISingleAccountPublicClientApplication.SignOutCallback() {
>     @Override
>     public void onSignOut() {
>         updateUI(null);
>         performOperationOnSignOut();
>     }
> 
>     @Override
>     public void onError(@NonNull MsalException exception) {
>         displayError(exception);
>     }
> });
> ```
> 
> #### Get a token interactively or silently
> 
> To present the fewest number of prompts to the user, you'll typically get a token silently. Then, if there's an error, attempt to get to token interactively. The first time the app calls `signIn()`, it effectively acts as a call to `acquireToken()`, which will prompt the user for credentials.
> 
> Some situations when the user may be prompted to select their account, enter their credentials, or consent to the permissions your app has requested are:
> 
> * The first time the user signs in to the application
> * If a user resets their password, they'll need to enter their credentials
> * If consent is revoked
> * If your app explicitly requires consent
> * When your application is requesting access to a resource for the first time
> * When MFA or other Conditional Access policies are required
> 
> The code to get a token interactively, that is with UI that will involve the user, is in  `SingleAccountModeFragment.java`, in `initializeUI()`, in the `callGraphApiInteractiveButton` click handler:
> 
> ```java
> /**
>  * If acquireTokenSilent() returns an error that requires an interaction (MsalUiRequiredException),
>  * invoke acquireToken() to have the user resolve the interrupt interactively.
>  *
>  * Some example scenarios are
>  *  - password change
>  *  - the resource you're acquiring a token for has a stricter set of requirement than your Single Sign-On refresh token.
>  *  - you're introducing a new scope which the user has never consented for.
>  **/
> mSingleAccountApp.acquireToken(getActivity(), getScopes(), getAuthInteractiveCallback());
> ```
> 
> If the user has already signed in, `acquireTokenSilentAsync()` allows apps to request tokens silently as shown in > `initializeUI()`, in the `callGraphApiSilentButton` click handler:
> 
> ```java
> /**
>  * Once you've signed the user in,
>  * you can perform acquireTokenSilent to obtain resources without interrupting the user.
>  **/
>   mSingleAccountApp.acquireTokenSilentAsync(getScopes(), AUTHORITY, getAuthSilentCallback());
> ```
> 
> #### Load an account
> 
> The code to load an account is in `SingleAccountModeFragment.java` in `loadAccount()`.  Loading the user's account is an asynchronous operation, so callbacks to handle when the account loads, changes, or an error occurs is passed to MSAL.  The following code also handles `onAccountChanged()`, which occurs when an account is removed, the user changes to another account, and so on.
> 
> ```java
> private void loadAccount() {
>     ...
> 
>     mSingleAccountApp.getCurrentAccountAsync(new ISingleAccountPublicClientApplication.CurrentAccountCallback() {
>         @Override
>         public void onAccountLoaded(@Nullable IAccount activeAccount) {
>             // You can use the account data to update your UI or your app database.
>             updateUI(activeAccount);
>         }
> 
>         @Override
>         public void onAccountChanged(@Nullable IAccount priorAccount, @Nullable IAccount currentAccount) {
>             if (currentAccount == null) {
>                 // Perform a cleanup task as the signed-in account changed.
>                 performOperationOnSignOut();
>             }
>         }
> 
>         @Override
>         public void onError(@NonNull MsalException exception) {
>             displayError(exception);
>         }
>     });
> ```
> 
> #### Call Microsoft Graph
> 
> When a user is signed in, the call to Microsoft Graph is made via an HTTP request by `callGraphAPI()` which is defined in `SingleAccountModeFragment.java`. This function is a wrapper that simplifies the sample by doing some tasks such as getting the access token from the `authenticationResult` and packaging the call to the MSGraphRequestWrapper, and displaying the results of the call.
> 
> ```java
> private void callGraphAPI(final IAuthenticationResult authenticationResult) {
>     MSGraphRequestWrapper.callGraphAPIUsingVolley(
>             getContext(),
>             graphResourceTextView.getText().toString(),
>             authenticationResult.getAccessToken(),
>             new Response.Listener<JSONObject>() {
>                 @Override
>                 public void onResponse(JSONObject response) {
>                     /* Successfully called graph, process data and send to UI */
>                     ...
>                 }
>             },
>             new Response.ErrorListener() {
>                 @Override
>                 public void onErrorResponse(VolleyError error) {
>                     ...
>                 }
>             });
> }
> ```

> 
> See [Understand  the Android MSAL configuration file](msal-configuration.md) for an explanation of these fields.

> 
> This file demonstrates how to create a multiple account MSAL app and call a Microsoft Graph API.
> 
> An example of a multiple account app is a mail app that allows you to work with multiple user accounts such as a work account and a personal account.
> 
> #### Multiple account MSAL initialization
> 
> In the `MultipleAccountModeFragment.java` file, in `onCreateView()`, a multiple account app object (`IMultipleAccountPublicClientApplication`) is created using the config information stored in the `auth_config_multiple_account.json file`:
> 
> ```java
> // Creates a PublicClientApplication object with res/raw/auth_config_multiple_account.json
> PublicClientApplication.createMultipleAccountPublicClientApplication(getContext(),
>         R.raw.auth_config_multiple_account,
>         new IPublicClientApplication.IMultipleAccountApplicationCreatedListener() {
>             @Override
>             public void onCreated(IMultipleAccountPublicClientApplication application) {
>                 mMultipleAccountApp = application;
>                 loadAccounts();
>             }
> 
>             @Override

>                 ...
>             }
>         });
> ```
> 
> The created `MultipleAccountPublicClientApplication` object is stored in a class member variable so that it can be used to interact with the MSAL library to acquire tokens and load and remove the user account.
> 
> #### Load an account
> 
> Multiple account apps usually call `getAccounts()` to select the account to use for MSAL operations. The code to load an account is in the `MultipleAccountModeFragment.java` file, in  `loadAccounts()`.  Loading the user's account is an asynchronous operation. So a callback handles the situations when the account is loaded, changes, or an error occurs.

> /**
>  * Load currently signed-in accounts, if there's any.

Before you can remove an account, you need an account object, which you obtain from MSAL methods like `getAccounts()` and `acquireToken()`. Because removing an account is an asynchronous operation, the `onRemoved` callback is supplied to update the UI.

# Tutorial: Set up an ASP.NET Core web app that authenticates users

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-workforce-external](../external-id/includes/applies-to-workforce-external.md)]

In this tutorial, you create an ASP.NET Core web app and configure it for authentication. This is part 1 of a series that demonstrates how to build an ASP.NET Core web application and prepare it for authentication using the Microsoft Entra admin center. This application can be used for employees in a workforce tenant or for customers using an external tenant

In this tutorial:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create an ASP.NET Core web app
> * Create a self-signed certificate
> * Configure the settings for the application
> * Define platform settings and URLs

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/). This account must have permissions to manage applications. Use any of the following roles needed to register the application:
  * Application Administrator
  * Application Developer
  * Cloud Application Administrator
* Although any integrated development environment (IDE) that supports ASP.NET Core applications can be used, this tutorial uses **Visual Studio Code**. You can download it [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).
* A minimum requirement of [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet).
* An ASP.NET Core developer certificate. Install one using [dotnet dev-certs](/dotnet/core/additional-tools/self-signed-certificates-guide#with-dotnet-dev-certs)

### [Workforce tenant](#tab/workforce-tenant)

* A workforce tenant. You can use your **Default Directory** or [set up a new tenant](./quickstart-create-new-tenant.md).
* An application registered in the Microsoft Entra admin center. Use the following setup for the purposes of this tutorial series:
  * **Name**: *identity-client-web-app*
  * **Supported account types**: *Accounts in this organizational directory only*
  * **Redirect URI**: `https://localhost:5001/signin-oidc`
  * **Front channel logout URL**: `https://localhost:5001/signout-oidc`
* For development purposes, [create a self signed certificate](./howto-create-self-signed-certificate.md). Refer to [add credentials](./quickstart-register-app.md#add-credentials) to upload the certificate and record the certificate **Thumbprint**. **Do not use a self signed certificate** for production apps. Use a trusted certificate authority.

### [External tenant](#tab/external-tenant)

* An external tenant. If you don't have one, [create a new external tenant](../external-id/customers/how-to-create-external-tenant-portal.md) in the Microsoft Entra admin center.
* A [self-service sign-up user flow](../external-id/customers/how-to-user-flow-sign-up-sign-in-customers.md). This user flow can be used across multiple applications.
* An application registered in the Microsoft Entra admin center,  Use the following setup for your app.
  * **Name**: *identity-client-web-app*
  * **Supported account types**: *Accounts in this organizational directory only*
  * **Redirect URI**: `https://localhost:5001/signin-oidc`
  * **Front channel logout URL**: `https://localhost:5001/signout-oidc`
* For development purposes, [create a self signed certificate](./howto-create-self-signed-certificate.md). Refer to [add credentials](./quickstart-register-app.md#add-credentials) to upload the certificate and record the certificate **Thumbprint**. **Do not use a self signed certificate** for production apps. Use a trusted certificate authority.
* To use your application in your external tenant; 
  * [Add your application to the user flow](../external-id/customers/how-to-user-flow-add-application.md).
  * [Grant admin consent for your tenant](./quickstart-register-app.md#grant-admin-consent-external-tenants-only).

## Create an ASP.NET Core project

In this section, you'll create an ASP.NET Core project in Visual Studio Code.

1. Open Visual Studio Code, select **File > Open Folder...**. Navigate to and select the location in which to create your project.
1. Open a new terminal by selecting **Terminal > New Terminal**.
1. Enter the following command to make a Model View Controller (MVC) ASP.NET Core project.

    ```console
    dotnet new mvc -n identity-client-web-app
    ```

## Install identity packages

This application uses [Microsoft.Identity.Web](/entra/msal/dotnet/microsoft-identity-web/) and the related NuGet package must be installed.

Use the following snippet to change into the new *identity-client-web-app* folder and install the relevant NuGet package:

```console
dotnet add package Microsoft.Identity.Web.UI
```

## Configure the application for authentication

The values recorded in your application setup are used to configure the application for authentication. The configuration file, *appsettings.json*, is used to store application settings used during run-time.

### Update the configuration file

In your IDE, open *appsettings.json* and replace the file contents with the following snippet. Replace the text in quotes with the values that were recorded earlier.

    }
  },

}

* `Instance` - The authentication endpoint. Check with the different available endpoints in [National clouds](authentication-national-cloud.md#azure-ad-authentication-endpoints).
* `TenantId` - The identifier of the tenant where the application is registered. Replace the text in quotes with the **Directory (tenant) ID** value that was recorded earlier from the overview page of the registered application.
* `ClientId` - The identifier of the application, also referred to as the client. Replace the text in quotes with the **Application (client) ID** value that was recorded earlier from the overview page of the registered application.
* `ClientCertificates` - A self-signed certificate is used for authentication in the application. Replace the text of the `CertificateThumbprint` with the thumbprint of the certificate that was previously recorded. Do not use a self signed certificate for production apps. 
* `CallbackPath` - Is an identifier to help the server redirect a response to the appropriate application.
* `DownstreamApi` - Is an identifier that defines an endpoint for accessing Microsoft Graph. The application URI is combined with the specified scope. To define the configuration for an application owned by the organization, the value of the `Scopes` attribute is slightly different.

### Update the redirect URI

From the [prerequisites](#prerequisites), the redirect URI is set to `https://localhost:5001/signin-oidc`. This needs to be updated in the application launch settings. You can use the redirect URI that is created during the local application setup, or any other available port number, provided it matches the redirect URI in the application registration.

1. In the **Properties** folder, open the *launchSettings.json* file.
1. Find the `https` object, and update the value of `applicationURI` with the correct port number, in this case, `5001`. The line should look similar to the following snippet:

    ```json
    "applicationUrl": "https://localhost:5001;http://localhost:{port}",
    ```

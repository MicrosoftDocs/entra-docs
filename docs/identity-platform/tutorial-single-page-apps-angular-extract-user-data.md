# Tutorial: Extract user data with an Angular SPA

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-workforce-external](../external-id/includes/applies-to-workforce-external.md)]

This tutorial is the final part of a series that demonstrates building an Angular single-page application (SPA) and adding authentication using the Microsoft identity platform. In [Part 2 of this series](tutorial-single-page-apps-angular-sign-in-users-app.md), you created an Angular SPA and prepared it for authentication with your workforce tenant. 

In this tutorial:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Add data processing to your Angular application.
> * Test the application and extract user data.

## Prerequisites

- [Tutorial: Add sign in and sign out in your Angular single-page application](tutorial-single-page-apps-angular-sign-in-users-app.md)

## Extract data to view in the application UI

### [Workforce tenant](#tab/workforce-tenant)

To configure your Angular application to interact with the Microsoft Graph API, complete the following steps:

1. Open the `src/app/profile/profile.component.ts` file and replace the contents with the following code snippet:

    ```typescript
    // Required for Angular
    import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
    
    // Required for the HTTP GET request to Graph
    import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
    
    type ProfileType = {
      businessPhones?: string,
      displayName?: string,
      givenName?: string,
      jobTitle?: string,
      mail?: string,
      mobilePhone?: string,
      officeLocation?: string,
      preferredLanguage?: string,
      surname?: string,
      userPrincipalName?: string,
      id?: string
    }
    
    @Component({
      selector: 'app-profile',
      templateUrl: './profile.component.html'
    })
    export class ProfileComponent implements OnInit {
      profile!: ProfileType;
      tokenExpiration!: string;
    
      constructor(
        private http: HttpClient
      ) { }
    
      // When the page loads, perform an HTTP GET request from the Graph /me endpoint
      ngOnInit() {
        this.http.get('https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me')
          .subscribe(profile => {
            this.profile = profile;
          });
    
        this.tokenExpiration = localStorage.getItem('tokenExpiration')!;
      }
    }
    ```
    
    The `ProfileComponent` in Angular fetches user profile data from Microsoft Graph's `/me` endpoint. It defines `ProfileType` to structure properties like `displayName` and `mail`. In `ngOnInit`, it uses `HttpClient` to send a GET request, assigning the response to `profile`. It also retrieves and stores the token expiration time from `localStorage` in `tokenExpiration`.

1. Open the `src/app/profile/profile.component.html` file and replace the contents with the following code snippet:

    ```html
    <div class="profile">
        <p><strong>Business Phones:</strong> {{profile?.businessPhones}}</p>
        <p><strong>Display Name:</strong> {{profile?.displayName}}</p>
        <p><strong>Given Name:</strong> {{profile?.givenName}}</p>
        <p><strong>Job Title:</strong> {{profile?.jobTitle}}</p>
        <p><strong>Mail:</strong> {{profile?.mail}}</p>
        <p><strong>Mobile Phone:</strong> {{profile?.mobilePhone}}</p>
        <p><strong>Office Location:</strong> {{profile?.officeLocation}}</p>
        <p><strong>Preferred Language:</strong> {{profile?.preferredLanguage}}</p>
        <p><strong>Surname:</strong> {{profile?.surname}}</p>
        <p><strong>User Principal Name:</strong> {{profile?.userPrincipalName}}</p>
        <p><strong>Profile Id:</strong> {{profile?.id}}</p>
        <br><br>
        <p><strong>Token Expiration:</strong> {{tokenExpiration}}</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>Refreshing this page will continue to use the cached access token until it nears expiration, at which point a new access token will be requested.</p>
    </div>
    ```
    
    This code defines an HTML template that displays user profile information, using Angular's interpolation syntax to bind properties from the `profile` object (For example., `businessPhones`, `displayName`, `jobTitle`). It also shows the `tokenExpiration` value and includes a note stating that refreshing the page will use the cached access token until it nears expiration, after which a new token will be requested.

### [External tenant](#tab/external-tenant)

You will configure your Angular app to display the claims in your ID token upon signing in. 

1. Create a file called *claim-utils.ts* in the *src/app/* folder and paste the following code snippet into it.

    ```javascript
    /**
     * Populate claims table with appropriate description
     * @param {Record} claims ID token claims
     * @returns claimsTable
     */
    export const createClaimsTable = (claims: Record<string, string>): any[] => {
      const claimsTable: any[] = [];

      Object.keys(claims).map((key) => {
        switch (key) {
          case 'aud':
            populateClaim(
              key,
              claims[key],
              "Identifies the intended recipient of the token. In ID tokens, the audience is your app's Application ID, assigned to your app in the Azure portal.",
              claimsTable
            );
            break;
          case 'iss':
            populateClaim(
              key,
              claims[key],
              'Identifies the issuer, or authorization server that constructs and returns the token. It also identifies the Azure AD tenant for which the user was authenticated. If the token was issued by the v2.0 endpoint, the URI will end in /v2.0.',
              claimsTable
            );
            break;
          case 'iat':
            populateClaim(
              key,
              changeDateFormat(+claims[key]),
              '"Issued At" indicates the timestamp (UNIX timestamp) when the authentication for this user occurred.',
              claimsTable
            );
            break;
          case 'nbf':
            populateClaim(
              key,
              changeDateFormat(+claims[key]),
              'The nbf (not before) claim dictates the time (as UNIX timestamp) before which the JWT must not be accepted for processing.',
              claimsTable
            );
            break;
          case 'exp':
            populateClaim(
              key,
              changeDateFormat(+claims[key]),
              "The exp (expiration time) claim dictates the expiration time (as UNIX timestamp) on or after which the JWT must not be accepted for processing. It's important to note that in certain circumstances, a resource may reject the token before this time. For example, if a change in authentication is required or a token revocation has been detected.",
              claimsTable
            );
            break;
          case 'name':

              claimsTable
            );
            break;
          case 'preferred_username':
            populateClaim(
              key,
              claims[key],
              'The primary username that represents the user. It could be an email address, phone number, or a generic username without a specified format.

It can be used for username hints, however, and in human-readable UI as a username. The profile scope is required in order to receive this claim.',
              claimsTable
            );
            break;

      <app-redirect></app-redirect>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

1. Open *src/app/guarded/guarded.component.ts* and replace the existing code with the following code snippet.

    ```javascript
    import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';

    @Component({
      selector: 'app-guarded',
      templateUrl: './guarded.component.html',
      styleUrls: ['./guarded.component.css']
    })
    export class GuardedComponent implements OnInit {

      constructor() { }

      ngOnInit(): void {
      }

    }
    ```

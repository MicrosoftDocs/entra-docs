# Tutorial: Call an API and display the results

In the [previous tutorial](tutorial-web-app-dotnet-sign-in-users.md), you added the sign-in and sign-out experiences to the application. The application can now be configured to call a web API. For the purposes of this tutorial, the Microsoft Graph API is called to display the profile information of the logged-in user.

> * Call the API and display the results
> * Test the application

## Prerequisites

* Completion of the prerequisites and steps in [Tutorial: Add sign in to an application](tutorial-web-app-dotnet-sign-in-users.md).

## Call the API and display the results

1. Under **Pages**, open the *Index.cshtml.cs* file and replace the entire contents of the file with the following snippet. Check that the project `namespace` matches your project name.

   :::code language="csharp" source="~/../ms-identity-docs-code-dotnet/web-app-aspnet/Pages/Index.cshtml.cs":::

1. Open *Index.cshtml* and add the following code to the bottom of the file. This handles how the information received from the API is displayed:

   :::code language="csharp" source="~/../ms-identity-docs-code-dotnet/web-app-aspnet/Pages/Index.cshtml" range="13-17":::

## Test the application

### [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio)

Start the application by selecting **Start without debugging**.

### [Visual Studio Code](#tab/visual-studio-code)

1. Start the application by typing the following in the terminal:

    #### [.NET 6.0](#tab/dotnet6)

    ```powershell
    dotnet run
    ```

    #### [.NET 7.0](#tab/dotnet7)

    ```powershell
    dotnet run --launch-profile https
    ```

### [Visual Studio for Mac](#tab/visual-studio-for-mac)

Start the application by selecting the **Play** icon.

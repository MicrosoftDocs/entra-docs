# Desktop app that calls web APIs: Acquire a token interactively

The following example shows minimal code to get a token interactively for reading the user's profile with Microsoft Graph.

# [.NET](#tab/dotnet)

### Code in MSAL.NET

```csharp
string[] scopes = new string[] { "user.read" };

var app = PublicClientApplicationBuilder.Create("YOUR_CLIENT_ID")
    .WithDefaultRedirectUri()
    .Build();

var accounts = await app.GetAccountsAsync();

AuthenticationResult result;
try
{
    result = await app.AcquireTokenSilent(scopes, accounts.FirstOrDefault())
      .ExecuteAsync();
}
catch (MsalUiRequiredException)
{
    result = await app.AcquireTokenInteractive(scopes).ExecuteAsync();
}
```

### Mandatory parameters

`AcquireTokenInteractive` has only one mandatory parameter, `scopes`. It contains an enumeration of strings that define the scopes for which a token is required. If the token is for Microsoft Graph, you can find the required scopes in the API reference of each Microsoft Graph API in the section named "Permissions." For instance, to [list the user's contacts](/graph/api/user-list-contacts), you must use both `User.Read` and `Contacts.Read` as the scope. For more information, see [Microsoft Graph permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

On both desktop and mobile applications, it's important to specify the parent by using `.WithParentActivityOrWindow`. In many cases, it's a requirement and MSAL will throw exceptions.

For desktop applications, see [Parent window handles](./scenario-desktop-acquire-token-wam.md#parent-window-handles).

For mobile applications, provide `Activity` (Android) or `UIViewController` (iOS).

### Optional parameters in MSAL.NET

#### WithParentActivityOrWindow

The UI is important because it's interactive. `AcquireTokenInteractive` has one specific optional parameter that can specify (for platforms that support it) the parent UI. When you use `.WithParentActivityOrWindow` in a desktop application, it has a different type that depends on the platform.

Alternatively, you can omit the optional parent window parameter to create a window, if you don't want to control where the sign-in dialog appears on the screen. This option is applicable for applications that are based on a command line, are used to pass calls to any other back-end service, and don't need any windows for user interaction.

```csharp
// net45
WithParentActivityOrWindow(IntPtr windowPtr)
WithParentActivityOrWindow(IWin32Window window)

// Mac
WithParentActivityOrWindow(NSWindow window)

// .NET Standard (this will be on all platforms at runtime, but only on .NET Standard platforms at build time)
WithParentActivityOrWindow(object parent).
```

Remarks:

- On .NET Standard, the expected `object` value is `Activity` on Android, `UIViewController` on iOS, `NSWindow` on Mac, and `IWin32Window` or `IntPr` on Windows.
- On Windows, you must call `AcquireTokenInteractive` from the UI thread so that the embedded browser gets the appropriate UI synchronization context. Not calling from the UI thread might cause messages to not pump properly and cause deadlock scenarios with the UI. One way of calling the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) from the UI thread if you aren't on the UI thread already is to use `Dispatcher` on Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF).
- If you're using WPF, to get a window from a WPF control, you can use the `WindowInteropHelper.Handle` class. Then the call is from a WPF control (`this`):

  ```csharp
  result = await app.AcquireTokenInteractive(scopes)
                    .WithParentActivityOrWindow(new WindowInteropHelper(this).Handle)
                    .ExecuteAsync();
  ```

#### WithPrompt

You use `WithPrompt()` to control the interactivity with the user by specifying a prompt. You can control the exact behavior by using the [Microsoft.Identity.Client.Prompt](/dotnet/api/microsoft.identity.client.prompt) structure.

The structure defines the following constants:

- `SelectAccount` forces the security token service (STS) to present the account selection dialog that contains accounts for which the user has a session. This option is the default. It's useful when you want to let users choose among different identities.

  This option drives MSAL to send `prompt=select_account` to the identity provider. It provides the best possible experience based on available information, such as the account and the presence of a session for the user. Don't change it unless you have a good reason.
- `Consent` enables you to force the user to be prompted for consent, even if the application granted consent before. In this case, MSAL sends `prompt=consent` to the identity provider. You can use this option in some security-focused applications where the organization's governance demands that the consent dialog box appears each time the user opens the application.
- `ForceLogin` enables you to have the application prompt the user for credentials, even if this user prompt might not be needed. This option can be useful to let the user sign in again if token acquisition fails. In this case, MSAL sends `prompt=login` to the identity provider. Organizations sometimes use this option in security-focused applications where governance demands that users sign in each time they access specific parts of an application.
- `Create` triggers a sign-up experience for external identities by sending `prompt=create` to the identity provider. Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C) apps shouldn't send this prompt. For more information, see [Add a self-service sign-up user flow to an app](~/external-id/self-service-sign-up-user-flow.yml).
- `Never` (for .NET 4.5 and Windows Runtime only) doesn't prompt the user. Instead, it tries to use the cookie stored in the hidden embedded web view.

  Use of this option might fail. In that case, `AcquireTokenInteractive` throws an exception to notify you that you need a UI interaction. Then, use another `Prompt` parameter.
- `NoPrompt` doesn't send any prompt to the identity provider. The identity provider decides which sign-in experience is best for the user (single sign-on or select account).

  This option is mandatory for editing profile policies in Azure AD B2C. For more information, see [Azure AD B2C specifics](https://aka.ms/msal-net-b2c-specificities).

#### WithUseEmbeddedWebView

This method enables you to specify if you want to force the usage of an embedded WebView or the system WebView (when available). For more information, see [Usage of web browsers](/entra/msal/dotnet/acquiring-tokens/using-web-browsers).

```csharp
var result = await app.AcquireTokenInteractive(scopes)
                    .WithUseEmbeddedWebView(true)
                    .ExecuteAsync();
```

#### WithExtraScopeToConsent

This modifier is for advanced scenarios where you want the user to consent to several resources up front and you don't want to use incremental consent. Developers normally use incremental consent with MSAL.NET and the Microsoft identity platform. For more information, see [Have the user consent up front for several resources](scenario-desktop-production.md#have-the-user-consent-upfront-for-several-resources).

```csharp
var result = await app.AcquireTokenInteractive(scopesForCustomerApi)
                     .WithExtraScopeToConsent(scopesForVendorApi)
                     .ExecuteAsync();
```

#### WithCustomWebUi

A web UI is a mechanism to invoke a browser. This mechanism can be a dedicated UI WebBrowser control or a way to delegate opening the browser.
MSAL provides web UI implementations for most platforms, but you might want to host the browser yourself in these cases:

- You have platforms that MSAL doesn't explicitly cover, like Blazor, Unity, and Mono on desktops.
- You want to UI test your application and use an automated browser that can be used with Selenium.
- The browser and the app that run MSAL are in separate processes.

To achieve this, you give to MSAL `start Url`, which needs to be displayed in a browser so that users can enter items such as their username. After authentication finishes, your app needs to pass back to MSAL `end Url`, which contains a code that Microsoft Entra ID provides. The host of `end Url` is always `redirectUri`. To intercept `end Url`, do one of the following things:

- Monitor browser redirects until `redirect Url` is hit.
- Have the browser redirect to a URL that you monitor.

`WithCustomWebUi` is an extensibility point that you can use to provide your own UI in public client applications. You can also let users go through the `/Authorize` endpoint of the identity provider and let them sign in and consent. MSAL.NET can then redeem the authentication code and get a token.

For example, you can use `WithCustomWebUi` in Visual Studio to have Electron applications (for instance, Visual Studio Feedback) provide the web interaction, but leave it to MSAL.NET to do most of the work. You can also use `WithCustomWebUi` if you want to provide UI automation.

In public client applications, MSAL.NET uses the Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) standard to ensure that security is respected. Only MSAL.NET can redeem the code. For more information, see [RFC 7636 - Proof Key for Code Exchange by OAuth Public Clients](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636).

```csharp
using Microsoft.Identity.Client.Extensions;
```

##### Use WithCustomWebUI

To use `WithCustomWebUI`, follow these steps:

1. Implement the `ICustomWebUi` interface. For more information, see [this GitHub page](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/blob/053a98d16596be7e9ca1ab916924e5736e341fe8/src/Microsoft.Identity.Client/Extensibility/ICustomWebUI.cs#L32-L70).
1. Implement one `AcquireAuthorizationCodeAsync`method and accept the authorization code URL that MSAL.NET computes.
1. Let the user go through the interaction with the identity provider and return the URL that the identity provider used to call back your implementation, along with the authorization code. If you have problems, your implementation should throw an `MsalExtensionException` exception to cooperate with MSAL.
1. In your `AcquireTokenInteractive` call, use the `.WithCustomUI()` modifier by passing the instance of your custom web UI:

    ```csharp
    result = await app.AcquireTokenInteractive(scopes)
                      .WithCustomWebUi(yourCustomWebUI)
                      .ExecuteAsync();
    ```

The MSAL.NET team has rewritten the UI tests to use this extensibility mechanism. If you're interested, view the [SeleniumWebUI](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/blob/053a98d16596be7e9ca1ab916924e5736e341fe8/tests/Microsoft.Identity.Test.Integration/Infrastructure/SeleniumWebUI.cs#L15-L160) class in the MSAL.NET source code.

##### Provide a great experience with SystemWebViewOptions

From MSAL.NET 4.1 [`SystemWebViewOptions`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.identity.client.systemwebviewoptions), you can specify:

- The URI to go to (`BrowserRedirectError`) or the HTML fragment to display (`HtmlMessageError`) if sign-in or consent errors appear in the system web browser.
- The URI to go to (`BrowserRedirectSuccess`) or the HTML fragment to display (`HtmlMessageSuccess`) if sign-in or consent is successful.
- The action to run to start the system browser. You can provide your own implementation by setting the `OpenBrowserAsync` delegate. The class also provides a default implementation for two browsers: `OpenWithEdgeBrowserAsync` for Microsoft Edge and `OpenWithChromeEdgeBrowserAsync` for [Microsoft Edge on Chromium](https://www.windowscentral.com/faq-edge-chromium).

To use this structure, write something like the following example:

```csharp
IPublicClientApplication app;
...

options = new SystemWebViewOptions
{
 HtmlMessageError = "<b>Sign-in failed. You can close this tab ...</b>",
 BrowserRedirectSuccess = "https://contoso.com/help-for-my-awesome-commandline-tool.html"
};

var result = app.AcquireTokenInteractive(scopes)
                .WithEmbeddedWebView(false)       // The default in .NET
                .WithSystemWebViewOptions(options)
                .Build();
```

#### Other optional parameters

To learn about the other optional parameters for `AcquireTokenInteractive`, see [AcquireTokenInteractiveParameterBuilder](/dotnet/api/microsoft.identity.client.acquiretokeninteractiveparameterbuilder#methods).

# [Java](#tab/java)

```java
private static IAuthenticationResult acquireTokenInteractive() throws Exception {

    // Load the token cache from the file and initialize the token cache aspect. The token cache will have
    // dummy data, so the acquireTokenSilently call will fail.
    TokenCacheAspect tokenCacheAspect = new TokenCacheAspect("sample_cache.json");

    PublicClientApplication pca = PublicClientApplication.builder(CLIENT_ID)
            .authority(AUTHORITY)
            .setTokenCacheAccessAspect(tokenCacheAspect)
            .build();

    Set<IAccount> accountsInCache = pca.getAccounts().join();
    // Take the first account in the cache. In a production application, you would filter
    // accountsInCache to get the right account for the user who is authenticating.
    IAccount account = accountsInCache.iterator().next();

    IAuthenticationResult result;
    try {
        SilentParameters silentParameters =
                SilentParameters
                        .builder(SCOPE, account)
                        .build();

        // try to acquire the token silently. This call will fail because the token cache
        // does not have any data for the user you're trying to acquire a token for
        result = pca.acquireTokenSilently(silentParameters).join();
    } catch (Exception ex) {
        if (ex.getCause() instanceof MsalException) {

            InteractiveRequestParameters parameters = InteractiveRequestParameters
                    .builder(new URI("http://localhost"))
                    .scopes(SCOPE)
                    .build();

            // Try to acquire a token interactively with the system browser. If successful, you should see
            // the token and account information printed out to the console
            result = pca.acquireToken(parameters).join();
        } else {
            // Handle other exceptions accordingly
            throw ex;
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

# [macOS](#tab/macOS)

### Code in MSAL for iOS and macOS

```objc
MSALInteractiveTokenParameters *interactiveParams = [[MSALInteractiveTokenParameters alloc] initWithScopes:scopes webviewParameters:[MSALWebviewParameters new]];
[application acquireTokenWithParameters:interactiveParams completionBlock:^(MSALResult *result, NSError *error) {
    if (!error)
    {
        // You'll want to get the account identifier to retrieve and reuse the account
        // for later acquireToken calls
        NSString *accountIdentifier = result.account.identifier;

        NSString *accessToken = result.accessToken;
    }
}];
```

```swift
let interactiveParameters = MSALInteractiveTokenParameters(scopes: scopes, webviewParameters: MSALWebviewParameters())
application.acquireToken(with: interactiveParameters, completionBlock: { (result, error) in

    guard let authResult = result, error == nil else {
        print(error!.localizedDescription)
        return
    }

    // Get the access token from the result
    let accessToken = authResult.accessToken
})
```

# [Node.js](#tab/nodejs)

In MSAL Node, you acquire tokens via authorization code flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE). The process has two steps:

1. The application obtains a URL that can be used to generate an authorization code. Users can open the URL in a browser and enter their credentials. They're then redirected back to `redirectUri` (registered during the app registration) with an authorization code.
1. The application passes the received authorization code to the `acquireTokenByCode()` method, which exchanges it for an access token.

```javascript
const msal = require("@azure/msal-node");

const msalConfig = {
    auth: {
        clientId: "your_client_id_here",
        authority: "your_authority_here",
    }
};

const pca = new msal.PublicClientApplication(msalConfig);

const {verifier, challenge} = await msal.cryptoProvider.generatePkceCodes();

const authCodeUrlParameters = {
    scopes: ["User.Read"],
    redirectUri: "your_redirect_uri",
    codeChallenge: challenge, // PKCE code challenge
    codeChallengeMethod: "S256" // PKCE code challenge method 
};

// Get the URL to sign in the user and consent to scopes needed for the application
pca.getAuthCodeUrl(authCodeUrlParameters).then((response) => {
    console.log(response);

    const tokenRequest = {
        code: response["authorization_code"],
        codeVerifier: verifier // PKCE code verifier 
        redirectUri: "your_redirect_uri",
        scopes: ["User.Read"],
    };

    // Acquire a token by exchanging the code
    pca.acquireTokenByCode(tokenRequest).then((response) => {
        console.log("\nResponse: \n:", response);
    }).catch((error) => {
        console.log(error);
    });
}).catch((error) => console.log(JSON.stringify(error)));
```

# [Python](#tab/python)

MSAL Python 1.7+ provides an interactive method for acquiring a token:

```python
result = None

# Check the cache to see if this user has signed in before
accounts = app.get_accounts(username=config["username"])
if accounts:
    result = app.acquire_token_silent(config["scope"], account=accounts[0])

if not result:
    result = app.acquire_token_interactive(  # It automatically provides PKCE protection
         scopes=config["scope"])
```

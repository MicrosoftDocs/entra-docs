#Customer intent: As a developer integrating external systems with Microsoft Entra ID, I want to troubleshoot issues with my custom authentication extension, so that I can identify and resolve any errors or performance problems affecting the authentication experience.

# Troubleshoot your custom authentication extension

Authentication events and [custom claims providers](custom-claims-provider-overview.md) allow you to customize the Microsoft Entra authentication experience by integrating with external systems.  For example, you can create a custom claims provider API and configure an [OpenID Connect app](./custom-extension-tokenissuancestart-configuration.md) or [SAML app](custom-extension-configure-saml-app.md) to receive tokens with claims from an external store.

## Error behavior

When an API call fails, the error behavior is as follows:

- For OpenId Connect apps - Microsoft Entra ID redirects the user back to the client application with an error. A token isn't minted.
- For SAML apps -  Microsoft Entra ID shows the user an error screen in the authentication experience. The user isn't redirected back to the client application.

The error code sent back to the application or the user is generic. To troubleshoot, check the [sign-in logs](#microsoft-entra-sign-in-logs) for the [error codes](#error-codes-reference).

## Logging

In order to troubleshoot issues with your custom claims provider REST API endpoint, the REST API must handle logging. Azure Functions and other API-development platforms provide in-depth logging solutions. Use those solutions to get detailed information on your APIs behavior and troubleshoot your API logic.

## Microsoft Entra sign-in logs

[!INCLUDE [portal updates](~/includes/portal-update.md)]

You can also use [Microsoft Entra sign-in logs](~/identity/monitoring-health/concept-sign-ins.md) in addition to your REST API logs, and hosting environment diagnostics solutions. Using Microsoft Entra sign-in logs, you can find errors, which may affect the users' sign-ins. The Microsoft Entra sign-in logs provide  information about the HTTP status, error code, execution duration, and number of retries that occurred the API was called by Microsoft Entra ID.

Microsoft Entra sign-in logs also integrate with [Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/). You can set up alerts and monitoring, visualize the data, and integrate with security information and event management (SIEM)  tools. For example, you can set up notifications if the number of errors exceed a certain threshold that you choose.

To access the Microsoft Entra sign-in logs:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications**.
1. Select **Sign-in logs**, and then select the latest sign-in log.
1. For more details, select the **Authentication Events** tab. Information related to the custom authentication extension REST API call is displayed, including any [error codes](#error-codes-reference).

## Call your REST API directly

Your REST API is protected by a Microsoft Entra access token. You can test your API by;
- Obtaining an access token with an [application registration](custom-extension-tokenissuancestart-configuration.md#12-grant-admin-consent) associated with the custom authentication extensions
- Test your API locally using an API testing tool. 

# [API testing tools](#tab/api-testing-tools)

1. For local development and testing purposes, open *local.settings.json* and replace the code with the following JSON: 

    ```json
    {
      "IsEncrypted": false,
      "Values": {
        "AzureWebJobsStorage": "",
        "AzureWebJobsSecretStorageType": "files",
        "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "dotnet",
        "AuthenticationEvents__BypassTokenValidation" : false
      }
    }
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    >
    > If you used the [Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.AuthenticationEvents](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/main/sdk/entra/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.AuthenticationEvents) NuGet package, be sure to set `"AuthenticationEvents__BypassTokenValidation" : true` for local testing purposes.
    >

1. Using your preferred API testing tool, create a new HTTP request and set the **HTTP method** to `POST`.
1. Use the following JSON body that imitates the request Microsoft Entra ID sends to your REST API.

    ```json
    {
        "type": "microsoft.graph.authenticationEvent.tokenIssuanceStart",
        "source": "/tenants/aaaabbbb-0000-cccc-1111-dddd2222eeee/applications/00001111-aaaa-2222-bbbb-3333cccc4444",

                    "appDisplayName": "My Test application",
                    "displayName": "My Test application"
                },
                "user": {
                    "companyName": "Casey Jensen",
                    "createdDateTime": "2023-08-16T00:00:00Z",
                    "displayName": "Casey Jensen",

                    "id": "00aa00aa-bb11-cc22-dd33-44ee44ee44ee",
                    "mail": "casey@contoso.com",
                    "onPremisesSamAccountName": "Casey Jensen",
                    "onPremisesSecurityIdentifier": "<Enter Security Identifier>",
                    "onPremisesUserPrincipalName": "Casey Jensen",
                    "preferredLanguage": "en-us",
                    "surname": "Jensen",
                    "userPrincipalName": "casey@contoso.com",
                    "userType": "Member"
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    > [!TIP]
    >
    > If you're using an access token obtained from Microsoft Entra ID, select **Authorization** and then select **Bearer token**, then paste the access token you received from Microsoft Entra ID.

1. Select **Send**, and you should receive a JSON response similar to the following:

    ```json
    {
        "data": {
            "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.onTokenIssuanceStartResponseData",
            "actions": [
                {
                    "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.tokenIssuanceStart.provideClaimsForToken",
                    "claims": {
                        "customClaim1": "customClaimValue1",
                        "customClaim2": [
                            "customClaimString1",
                            "customClaimString2" 
                        ]
                    }
                }
    
            ]
        }
    }
    ```

# [Obtain an access token](#tab/obtain-an-access-token)

After you acquire an access token, pass it the HTTP `Authorization` header. To obtain an access token, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Application registrations**.
1. Select the *Azure Functions authentication events API* app registration, previously configured in [configure a custom claim provider for a token issuance event](custom-extension-tokenissuancestart-configuration.md#step-1-register-a-custom-authentication-extension).
1. Copy the [application ID](custom-extension-tokenissuancestart-configuration.md#12-grant-admin-consent).
1. If you haven't created an app secret, follow these steps:
    1. Select **Certificates & secrets** > **Client secrets** > **New client secret**.
    1. Add a description for your client secret.
    1. Select an expiration for the secret or specify a custom lifetime.
    1. Select **Add**.
    1. Record the **secret's value** for use in your client application code. This secret value is never displayed again after you leave this page.
1. From the menu, select **Expose an API** and copy the value of the **Application ID URI**. For example, `api://contoso.azurewebsites.net/00001111-aaaa-2222-bbbb-3333cccc4444`.
1. Open your preferred API testing tool and create a new HTTP query.
1. Change the **HTTP method** to `POST`.
1. Enter the following URL. Replace the `{tenantID}` with your tenant ID.

    ```http
    https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenantID}/oauth2/v2.0/token
    ```

1. Under the **Body**, select **form-data** and add the following keys:

    |Key  |Value  |
    |---------|---------|
    |`grant_type`| `client_credentials`|
    |`client_id`| The **Client ID** of your application.|
    |`client_secret`|The **Client Secret** of your application.|
    |`scope`| The **Application ID URI** of your application, then add `.default`. For example, `api://contoso.azurewebsites.net/00001111-aaaa-2222-bbbb-3333cccc4444/.default`|

1. Run the HTTP query and copy the `access_token` into the <https://jwt.ms> web app.
1. Compare the `iss` with the issuer name you [configured in your API](custom-extension-tokenissuancestart-configuration.md#step-4-protect-your-azure-function).
1. Compare the `aud` with the client ID you [configured in your API](custom-extension-tokenissuancestart-configuration.md#step-4-protect-your-azure-function).

## Common performance improvements

One of the most common issues is that your custom claims provider API doesn't respond within the two-seconds timeout. If your REST API doesn't respond in subsequent retries, then the authentication fails. To improve the performance of your REST API, follow the below suggestions:

1. If your API accesses any downstream APIs, cache the access token used to call these APIs, so a new token doesn't have to be acquired on every execution.
1. Performance issues are often related to downstream services. Add logging, which records the process time to call to any downstream services.
1. If you use a cloud provider to host your API, use a hosting plan that keeps the API always "warm". For Azure Functions, it can be either [the Premium plan or Dedicated plan](/azure/azure-functions/functions-scale).
1. [Run automated integration tests](test-automate-integration-testing.md) for your authentications. You can also use API testing tools to test just your API performance.

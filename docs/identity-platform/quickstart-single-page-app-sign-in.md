#Customer intent: As an app developer, I want to learn how to get access tokens and refresh tokens by using the Microsoft identity platform so that my single-page app app can sign in users of personal accounts, work accounts, and school accounts.

# Quickstart: Sign in users in a single-page app (SPA) and call the Microsoft Graph API

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-workforce-external](../external-id/includes/applies-to-workforce-external.md)]

In this quickstart, you use a sample single-page app (SPA) to show you how to sign in users by using the [authorization code flow](./v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow.md) with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) and call the Microsoft Graph API. The sample uses the [Microsoft Authentication Library](msal-overview.md) to handle authentication.

#Customer intent: As a developer seeking assistance with integrating applications with the Microsoft identity platform, I want to explore support options such as creating an Azure support request, posting a question on Microsoft Q&A, and opening a GitHub issue for MSAL libraries, so that I can get the help I need to solve problems and find answers to my questions.

# Support and help options for developers

If you need an answer to a question or help in solving a problem not covered in our documentation, it might be time to reach out to experts for help. Here are several suggestions for getting answers to your questions as you develop applications that integrate with the Microsoft identity platform.

## Create an Azure support request

</div>

Explore the range of [Azure support options and choose the plan](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans) that best fits you. There are two options to create and manage support requests in the Microsoft Entra admin center:

- If you already have an Azure Support Plan, [open a support request here](https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Support/NewSupportRequestV3Blade/callerName/ActiveDirectory/issueType/technical).

- If you're using Microsoft Entra ID for customers (preview), the support request feature is currently unavailable in external tenants. However, you can use the **Give Feedback** link on the **New support request** page to provide feedback. Or, you can switch to your Microsoft Entra workforce tenant and [open a support request](https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Support/NewSupportRequestV3Blade/callerName/ActiveDirectory/issueType/technical).

- If you're not an Azure customer, you can open a support request with [Microsoft Support for business](https://support.serviceshub.microsoft.com/supportforbusiness).

## Post a question to Microsoft Q&A

</div>

Get answers to your identity app development questions directly from Microsoft engineers, Azure Most Valuable Professionals (MVPs), and members of our expert community.

[Microsoft Q&A](/answers/products/) is Azure's recommended source of community support.

If you can't find an answer to your problem by searching Microsoft Q&A, submit a new question. Use one of following tags when you ask your [high-quality question](/answers/articles/24951/how-to-write-a-quality-question.html):

If you need help with one of the Microsoft Authentication Libraries (MSAL), open an issue in its repository on GitHub.

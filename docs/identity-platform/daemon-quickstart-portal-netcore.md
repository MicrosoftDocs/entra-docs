> # Quickstart: Get a token and call the Microsoft Graph API by using a console app's identity
> 
> In this quickstart, you download and run a code sample that demonstrates how a .NET console application can get an access token to call the Microsoft Graph API and display a [list of users](/graph/api/user-list) in the directory. The code sample also demonstrates how a job or a Windows service can run with an application identity, instead of a user's identity. The sample console application in this quickstart is also a daemon application, so it's a confidential client application.

> [.NET 6.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)
> 
> > [!div class="sxs-lookup"]
> ### Download and configure your quickstart app
> 
> #### Step 1: Configure your application in the Azure portal
> For the code sample in this quickstart to work, create a client secret and add the Graph API's **User.Read.All** application permission.
>
> <button id="makechanges" class="nextstepaction configure-app-button"> Make these changes for me </button>
> 
> > [!div id="appconfigured" class="alert alert-info"]
> > ![Already configured](media/quickstart-v2-netcore-daemon/green-check.png) Your application is configured with these attributes.
> 
> #### Step 2: Download your Visual Studio project
> 
> > [!div class="sxs-lookup"]
> > Run the project by using Visual Studio 2019.

> 
> #### Step 3: Admin consent
> 
> If you try to run the application at this point, you'll receive an *HTTP 403 - Forbidden* error: "Insufficient privileges to complete the operation." This error happens because any app-only permission requires a Global Administrator of your directory to give consent to your application. Select one of the following options, depending on your role.
> 
> ##### Global tenant administrator
> 
> If you're a Global Administrator, go to the **API Permissions** page and select **Grant admin consent for Enter_the_Tenant_Name_Here**.
> > [!div id="apipermissionspage"]
> > [Go to the API Permissions page]()
> 
> ##### Standard user
> 
> If you're a standard user of your tenant, ask a Global Administrator to grant admin consent for your application. To do this, give the following URL to your administrator:
> 
> ```url
> https://login.microsoftonline.com/Enter_the_Tenant_Id_Here/adminconsent?client_id=Enter_the_Application_Id_Here
> ```
> 
> You might see the error "AADSTS50011: No reply address is registered for the application" after you grant consent to the app by using the preceding URL. This error happens because this application and the URL don't have a redirect URI. You can ignore it.
> 
> #### Step 4: Run the application
> 
> If you're using Visual Studio or Visual Studio for Mac, press **F5** to run the application. Otherwise, run the application via command prompt, console, or terminal:
>
> Visual Studio for Mac is scheduled for retirement by August 31, 2024 in accordance with Microsoftâ€™s [Modern Lifecycle Policy](/lifecycle/policies/modern). Visual Studio for Mac 17.6 will continue to be supported until August 31, 2024, with servicing updates for security issues and updated platforms from Apple.
> Refer to [What's happening to Visual Studio for Mac](/visualstudio/mac/what-happened-to-vs-for-mac) for more information.

> ```dotnetcli
> cd {ProjectFolder}\1-Call-MSGraph\daemon-console
> dotnet run
> ```
> In that code:
> * `{ProjectFolder}` is the folder where you extracted the .zip file. An example is `C:\Azure-Samples\active-directory-dotnetcore-daemon-v2`.
> 
> You should see a list of users in Microsoft Entra ID as result.
> 
> This quickstart application uses a client secret to identify itself as a confidential client. The client secret is added as a plain-text file to your project files. For security reasons, we recommend that you use a certificate instead of a client secret before considering the application as a production application. For more information on how to use a certificate, see [these instructions](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnetcore-daemon-v2/#variation-daemon-application-using-client-credentials-with-certificates) in the GitHub repository for this sample.

> This section gives an overview of the code required to sign in users. This overview can be useful to understand how the > code works, what the main arguments are, and how to add sign-in to an existing .NET console application.

> ### How the sample works
> ![Diagram that shows how the sample app generated by this quickstart works.](media/quickstart-v2-netcore-daemon/netcore-daemon-intro.svg)
> 
> ### MSAL.NET
> 
> Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL, in the [Microsoft.Identity.Client](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Identity.Client) package) is the library that's used to sign in users and request tokens for accessing an API protected by the Microsoft identity platform. This quickstart requests tokens by using the application's own identity instead of delegated permissions. The authentication flow in this case is known as a [client credentials OAuth flow](v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow.md). For more information on how to use MSAL.NET with a client credentials flow, see [this article](https://aka.ms/msal-net-client-credentials).
> 
>  You can install MSAL.NET by running the following command in the Visual Studio Package Manager Console:
> 
> ```dotnetcli
> dotnet add package Microsoft.Identity.Client
> ```
> 
> ### MSAL initialization
> 
> You can add the reference for MSAL by adding the following code:
> 
> ```csharp
> using Microsoft.Identity.Client;
> ```
> 
> Then, initialize MSAL by using the following code:
> 
> ```csharp
> IConfidentialClientApplication app;
> app = ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder.Create(config.ClientId)
>                                           .WithClientSecret(config.ClientSecret)
>                                           .WithAuthority(new Uri(config.Authority))
>                                           .Build();
> ```
> 
>  | Element | Description |
>  |---------|---------|
>  | `config.ClientSecret` | The client secret created for the application in the Azure portal. |
>  | `config.ClientId` | The application (client) ID for the application registered in the Azure portal. You can find this value on the app's **Overview** page in the Azure portal. |
>  | `config.Authority`    | (Optional) The security token service (STS) endpoint for the user to authenticate. It's usually `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}` for the public cloud, where `{tenant}` is the name of your tenant or your tenant ID.|
> 
> For more information, see the [reference documentation for `ConfidentialClientApplication`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.identity.client.iconfidentialclientapplication).
> 
> ### Requesting tokens
> 
> To request a token by using the app's identity, use the `AcquireTokenForClient` method:
> 
> ```csharp
> result = await app.AcquireTokenForClient(scopes)
>                   .ExecuteAsync();
> ```
> 
> |Element| Description |
> |---------|---------|
> | `scopes` | Contains the requested scopes. For confidential clients, this value should use a format similar to `{Application ID URI}/.default`. This format indicates that the requested scopes are the ones that are statically defined in the app object set in the Azure portal. For Microsoft Graph, `{Application ID URI}` points to `https://graph.microsoft.com`. For custom web APIs, `{Application ID URI}` is defined in the Azure portal, under **Application Registration ** > **Expose an API**. |
> 
> For more information, see the [reference documentation for `AcquireTokenForClient`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.identity.client.confidentialclientapplication.acquiretokenforclient).

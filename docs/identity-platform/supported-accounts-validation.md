#Customer intent: As a developer registering an application with the Microsoft identity platform, I want to understand the validation differences between supported account types, so that I can ensure that the properties of my application are configured correctly.

# Validation differences by supported account types (signInAudience)

When registering an application with the Microsoft identity platform for developers, you're asked to select which account types your application supports. You can refer to the **Help me choose** link under **Supported account types** during the registration process. The value you select for this property has implications on other app object properties.

After the application has been registered, you can check or change the account type that the application supports at any time. Under the **Manage** pane of your application, search for **Manifest** and find the `signInAudience` value. The different account types, and the corresponding `signInAudience` are shown in the following table:

| Supported account types (Register an application) | `signInAudience` (Manifest) |
|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Accounts in this organizational directory only (Single tenant) | `AzureADMyOrg` |
| Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Microsoft Entra directory - Multitenant) | `AzureADMultipleOrgs` |
| Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Microsoft Entra directory - Multitenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox) | `AzureADandPersonalMicrosoftAccount` |
| Personal Microsoft accounts only | `PersonalMicrosoftAccount` |

If you change this property you may need to change other properties first. 

## Validation differences

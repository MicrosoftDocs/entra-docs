# Prepare external tenant for calling an API in a Node.js web application

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-external-only](../external-id/includes/applies-to-external-only.md)]

In this article, you prepare your external tenant for authorization. This article is the first part of a four-part guide.

## Prerequisite

- Complete the steps in [Tutorial: Set up a Node.js web app to sign in users by using Microsoft identity platform](tutorial-web-app-node-sign-in-prepare-app.md).

- Complete the steps in [Tutorial: Secure an ASP.NET web API registered in an external tenant](/entra/external-id/customers/tutorial-protect-web-api-dotnet-core-build-app). After you complete this tutorial, you register a web API in your customer's tenant, which exposes API permissions and publishes application roles. You also have a secured web API. You call this web API from the client web application.

## Configure idtyp token claim [optional]

[!INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-app-integration-add-user-flow](../external-id/customers/includes/register-app/add-optional-claims-access.md)]

Use the steps in [Configure optional claims](optional-claims.md?tabs=appui) article to add idtyp claim to the access token:

- For the **Token type** select **Access**.
- From the optional claims list, select **idtyp**.  

### Grant API permissions to the web app

From the prerequisites, you registered a client app in your customer's tenant. You also registered a web API app in your customers. Now, you need to grant API permissions to your client app:

[!INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-app-integration-add-user-flow](../external-id/customers/includes/register-app/grant-api-permission-call-api-common.md)]

## Next step

Next, learn how to prepare your web application and API.

## Configure the sample web app

For you to sign in users with the sample app, you need to update it with your app and tenant details:

#### [Node](#tab/node-workforce)

In the *ms-identity-node* folder, open the *App/.env* file, then replace the following placeholders:

| Variable  |  Description | Example(s) |
|-----------|--------------|------------|
| `Enter_the_Cloud_Instance_Id_Here` | The Azure cloud instance in which your application is registered | `https://login.microsoftonline.com/` (include the trailing forward-slash) |
| `Enter_the_Tenant_Info_here` | Tenant ID or Primary domain | `contoso.microsoft.com` or `aaaabbbb-0000-cccc-1111-dddd2222eeee` |
| `Enter_the_Application_Id_Here` | Client ID of the application you registered | `00001111-aaaa-2222-bbbb-3333cccc4444` |
| `Enter_the_Client_Secret_Here` | Client secret of the application you registered | `A1b-C2d_E3f.H4i,J5k?L6m!N7o-P8q_R9s.T0u` |
| `Enter_the_Graph_Endpoint_Here` | The Microsoft Graph API cloud instance that your app calls | `https://graph.microsoft.com/` (include the trailing forward-slash) |
| `Enter_the_Express_Session_Secret_Here` | A random string of characters used to sign the Express session cookie | `A1b-C2d_E3f.H4...` |

After you make changes, your file should look similar to the following snippet:

```env
CLOUD_INSTANCE=https://login.microsoftonline.com/
TENANT_ID=aaaabbbb-0000-cccc-1111-dddd2222eeee
CLIENT_ID=00001111-aaaa-2222-bbbb-3333cccc4444
CLIENT_SECRET=A1b-C2d_E3f.H4...

REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/auth/redirect
POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000

GRAPH_API_ENDPOINT=https://graph.microsoft.com/

EXPRESS_SESSION_SECRET=6DP6v09eLiW7f1E65B8k
```


#### [ASP.NET Core](#tab/asp-dot-net-core-workforce)

1. In your IDE, open the project folder, *ms-identity-docs-code-dotnet\web-app-aspnet*, containing the sample.
1. Open *appsettings.json* and replace the file contents with the following snippet;

    :::code language="json" source="~/../ms-identity-docs-code-dotnet/web-app-aspnet/appsettings.json" :::

    * `TenantId` - The identifier of the tenant where the application is registered. Replace the text in quotes with the `Directory (tenant) ID` that was recorded earlier from the overview page of the registered application.
    * `ClientId` - The identifier of the application, also referred to as the client. Replace the text in quotes with the `Application (client) ID` value that was recorded earlier from the overview page of the registered application.
    * `ClientCertificates` - A self-signed certificate is used for authentication in the application. Replace the text of the `CertificateThumbprint` with the thumbprint of the certificate that was previously recorded.

#### [Python Flask](#tab/python-flask-workforce)

1. Open the application you downloaded in an IDE and navigate to root folder of the sample app.

    ```console
    cd flask-web-app
    ```
1. Create an *.env* file in the root folder of the project using *.env.sample.entra-id* as a guide.

    ```python
    # The following variables are required for the app to run.
    CLIENT_ID=<Enter_your_client_id>
    CLIENT_SECRET=<Enter_your_client_secret>
    AUTHORITY=<Enter_your_authority_url>
    ```

    * Set the value of `CLIENT_ID` to the **Application (client) ID** for the registered application, available on the overview page.
    * Set the value of `CLIENT_SECRET` to the client secret you created in the **Certificates & Secrets** for the registered application.
    * Set the value of `AUTHORITY` to a `https://login.microsoftonline.com/<TENANT_GUID>`. The **Directory (tenant) ID** is available on the app registration overview page.
    
    The environment variables are referenced in *app_config.py*, and are kept in a separate *.env* file to keep them out of source control. The provided *.gitignore* file prevents the *.env* file from being checked in. 
---

## Run and test sample web app

You've configured your sample app. You can proceed to run and test it.

#### [Node](#tab/node-workforce)


1. To start the server, run the following commands from within the project directory:

    ```console
    cd App
    npm install
    npm start
    ```

1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/`.

1. Select **Sign in** to start the sign-in process.

The first time you sign in, you're prompted to provide your consent to allow the application to sign you in and access your profile. After you're signed in successfully, you'll be redirected back to the application home page. 

### How the app works

The sample hosts a web server on localhost, port 3000. When a web browser accesses this address, the app renders the home page. Once the user selects **Sign in**, the app redirects the browser to Microsoft Entra sign-in screen, via the URL generated by the MSAL Node library. After user consents, the browser redirects the user back to the application home page, along with an ID and access token.  

#### [ASP.NET Core](#tab/asp-dot-net-core-workforce)

1. In your project directory, use the terminal to enter the following commands:

    ```console
    cd ms-identity-docs-code-dotnet/web-app-aspnet
    dotnet run
    ```

1. Copy the `https` URL that appears in the terminal, for example, `https://localhost:5001`, and paste it into a browser. We recommend using a private or incognito browser session.
1. Follow the steps and enter the necessary details to sign in with your Microsoft account. You're requested to provide an email address so a one time passcode can be sent to you. Enter the code when prompted.
1. The application requests permission to maintain access to data you have given it access to, and to sign you in and read your profile. Select **Accept**. The following screenshot appears. It indicates that you're signed-in to the application and are viewing your profile details from the Microsoft Graph API.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/common-web-app/dotnet-core/display-api-call-results-dotnet-core.png" alt-text="Screenshot depicting the results of the API call." lightbox="./media/common-web-app/dotnet-core/display-api-call-results-dotnet-core.png":::

### Sign out from the application

1. Find the **Sign out** link in the top right corner of the page, and select it.
1. You're prompted to pick an account to sign out from. Select the account you used to sign in.
1. A message appears indicating that you signed out. You can now close the browser window. 

#### [Python Flask](#tab/python-flask-workforce)

1. Create a virtual environment for the app:

    [!INCLUDE [Virtual environment setup](./includes/python-web-app/virtual-environment-setup.md)]

1. Install the requirements using `pip`:

    ```Console
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

1. Run the app from the command line. Ensure your app is running on the same port as the redirect URI you configured earlier.

    ```Console
    flask run --debug --host=localhost --port=5000
    ```
1. Copy the https URL that appears in the terminal, for example, https://localhost:5000, and paste it into a browser. We recommend using a private or incognito browser session.

1. Follow the steps and enter the necessary details to sign in with your Microsoft account. You're requested to provide an email address and password to sign in.

1. The application requests permission to maintain access to data you allow access to, and to sign you in and then read your profile, as shown in the screenshot. Select **Accept**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/python-webapp/consent.png" alt-text="Diagram that shows the sample app requesting for consent to access the required permissions.":::

1. The following screenshot appears, which indicates that you've successfully signed in to the application. 

:::image type="content" source="media/python-webapp/signed-in-user.png" alt-text="Diagram that shows how the sample app has successfully signed in a user.":::

### How the app works

The following diagram demonstrates how the sample app works:

:::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-v2-python-webapp/topology.png" alt-text="Diagram that shows how the sample app generated by this quickstart works.":::

1. The application uses the [`identity` package](https://github.com/azure-samples/ms-identity-python) to obtain an access token from the Microsoft identity platform. This package is built on top of the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for Python to simplify authentication and authorization in web apps.

1. The access token you obtain in the previous step is used as a bearer token to authenticate the user when calling the Microsoft Graph API.

1. Find the placeholder:

    - `Enter_the_Application_Id_Here` and replace it with the Application (client) ID of the app you registered earlier.
    - `Enter_the_Tenant_Subdomain_Here` and replace it with the Directory (tenant) subdomain. For example, if your tenant primary domain is `contoso.onmicrosoft.com`, use `contoso`. If you don't have your tenant name, learn how to [read your tenant details](/entra/external-id/customers/how-to-create-customer-tenant-portal#get-the-customer-tenant-details).
    - `Enter_the_Client_Secret_Here` and replace it with the app secret value you copied earlier.


#### [ASP.NET Core](#tab/asp-dot-net-core-external)

1. Navigate to the root directory that contains the ASP.NET Core sample app:

    ```console
    cd 1-Authentication\1-sign-in-aspnet-core-mvc
    ```

1. Open the *appsettings.json* file.
1. In **Authority**, find `Enter_the_Tenant_Subdomain_Here` and replace it with the subdomain of your tenant. For example, if your tenant primary domain is *caseyjensen@onmicrosoft.com*, the value you should enter is *casyjensen*.
1. Find the `Enter_the_Application_Id_Here` value and replace it with the application ID (clientId) of the app you registered in the Microsoft Entra admin center.
1. Replace `Enter_the_Client_Secret_Here` with the client secret value you set up.


#### [Python Django](#tab/python-django-external)

1. Open your project files on Visual Studio Code or the editor you're using.

1. Create an *.env* file in the root folder of the project using *.env.sample.external-id* file as a guide.

1. In your *.env* file, provide the following environment variables:

    1. `CLIENT_ID` which is the Application (client) ID of the app you registered earlier.
    1. `CLIENT_SECRET` which is the app secret value you copied earlier.
    1. `AUTHORITY` which is the URL that identifies a token authority. It should be of the format *https://{subdomain}.ciamlogin.com/{subdomain}.onmicrosoft.com*. Replace *subdomain* with the Directory (tenant) subdomain. For example, if your tenant primary domain is `contoso.onmicrosoft.com`, use `contoso`. If you don't have your tenant subdomain, learn how to [read your tenant details](/entra/external-id/customers/how-to-create-external-tenant-portal#get-the-external-tenant-details).
    1. `REDIRECT_URI` which should be similar to the redirect URI you registered earlier should match your configuration.


#### [Python Flask](#tab/python-flask-external)

1. Open your project files on Visual Studio Code or the editor you're using.

1. Create an *.env* file in the root folder of the project using *.env.sample.external-id* file as a guide.

1. In your *.env* file, provide the following environment variables:

    - `CLIENT_ID` which is the Application (client) ID of the app you registered earlier.
    - `CLIENT_SECRET` which is the app secret value you copied earlier.
    - `AUTHORITY` which is the URL that identifies a token authority. It should be of the format *https://{subdomain}.ciamlogin.com/{subdomain}.onmicrosoft.com*. Replace *subdomain* with the Directory (tenant) subdomain. For example, if your tenant primary domain is `contoso.onmicrosoft.com`, use `contoso`. If you don't have your tenant subdomain, learn how to [read your tenant details](/entra/external-id/customers/how-to-create-customer-tenant-portal#get-the-customer-tenant-details).

1. Confirm that the redirect URI is well configured. The redirect URI you registered earlier should match your configuration. This sample by default sets the redirect URI path to `/getAToken`. This configuration is in the *app_config.py* file as *REDIRECT_PATH*.

## Run and test sample web app

#### [Node](#tab/node-external)

You can now test the sample Node.js web app. You need to start the Node.js server and access it through your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

1. In your terminal, run the following command:

    ```console
    npm start 
    ```

1. Open your browser, then go to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the page similar to the following screenshot:

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-web-app-node-sample-sign-in/web-app-node-sign-in.png" alt-text="Screenshot of sign in into a node web app.":::

1. After the page completes loading, select **Sign in** when prompted.

1. On the sign-in page, type your **Email address**, select **Next**, type your **Password**, then select **Sign in**. If you don't have an account, select **No account? Create one** link, which starts the sign-up flow.

1. If you choose the sign-up option, after filling in your email, one-time passcode, new password, and more account details, you complete the whole sign-up flow. You see a page similar to the following screenshot. You see a similar page if you choose the sign-in option.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-web-app-node-sample-sign-in/web-app-node-view-claims.png" alt-text="Screenshot of view ID token claims.":::

1. Select **Sign out** to sign the user out of the web app or select **View ID token claims** to view ID token claims returned by Microsoft Entra.

### How it works

When users select the **Sign in** link, the app initiates an authentication request and redirects users to Microsoft Entra External ID. On the sign-in or sign-up page that appears, once a user successfully signs in, or creates an account, Microsoft Entra External ID returns an ID token to the app. The app validates the ID token, reads the claims, and returns a secure page to the users.  

When the users select the **Sign out** link, the app clears its session, then redirect the user to Microsoft Entra External ID sign-out endpoint to notify it that the user has signed out.

If you want to build an app similar to the sample you've run, complete the steps in [Sign in users in your own Node.js web application](/entra/external-id/customers/tutorial-web-app-node-sign-in-prepare-tenant) article.

#### [ASP.NET Core](#tab/asp-dot-net-core-external)

1. From your shell or command line, execute the following commands:

    ```console
    dotnet run
    ```

1. Open your web browser and navigate to `https://localhost:7274`.

1. Sign-in with an account registered to the external tenant.

1. Once signed in the display name is shown next to the **Sign out** button as shown in the following screenshot.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-web-app-dotnet-sign-in-sign-in-out/display-aspnet-welcome.png" alt-text="Screenshot of sign in into a ASP.NET Core web app.":::

1. To sign out from the application, select the **Sign out** button.

#### [Python Django](#tab/python-django-external)

Run the app to see the sign-in experience at play.

1. In your terminal, run the following command:

    ```console
    python manage.py runserver localhost:5000                                             
    ```
    
    You can use a port number of your choice.

1. Open your browser, then go to `http://localhost:5000`. You should see a page similar to the following screenshot:

    :::image type="content" source="media/sample-web-app-django-sign-in/django-sign-in-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Django web app sample sign-in page.":::

1. After the page completes loading, select **Sign In** link. You're prompted to sign in.

1. On the sign-in page, type your **Email address**, select **Next**, type your **Password**, then select **Sign in**. If you don't have an account, select **No account? Create one** link, which starts the sign-up flow.

1. If you choose the sign-up option, you go through the sign-up flow. Fill in your email, one-time passcode, new password, and more account details to complete the whole sign-up flow.

1. After you sign in or sign up, you're redirected back to the web app. You see a page that looks similar to the following screenshot:

    :::image type="content" source="media/sample-web-app-django-sign-in/django-authenticated-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot of flask web app sample after successful authentication.":::

1. Select **Logout** to sign the user out of the web app or select **Call a downstream API** to make a call to a Microsoft Graph endpoint.

### How it works

When users select the **Sign in** link, the app initiates an authentication request and redirects users to Microsoft Entra External ID. A user then signs in or signs up page on the page that appears. After providing in the required credentials and consenting to required scopes, Microsoft Entra External ID redirects the user back to the web app with an authorization code. The web app then uses this authorization code to acquire a token from Microsoft Entra External ID.

When the users select the **Logout** link, the app clears its session, the redirect the user to Microsoft Entra External ID sign-out endpoint to notify it that the user has signed out. The user is then redirected back to the web app.

#### [Python Flask](#tab/python-flask-external)

Run the app to see the sign-in experience at play.

[!INCLUDE [python-flask-web-app-run-app](../external-id/customers/includes/run-app/flask-web-app.md)]

### How it works

When users select the **Sign in** link, the app initiates an authentication request and redirects users to Microsoft Entra External ID. A user then signs in or signs up page on the page that appears. After providing in the required credentials and consenting to required scopes, Microsoft Entra External ID redirects the user back to the web app with an authorization code. The web app then uses this authorization code to acquire a token from Microsoft Entra External ID.

#Customer intent: As an app developer, I want to learn how to login, logout, conditionally render components to authenticated users, and acquire an access token for a protected resource such as Microsoft Graph by using the Microsoft identity platform so that my JavaScript React app can sign in users of personal accounts, work accounts, and school accounts.

>  # Quickstart: Sign in and get an access token in a React SPA using the auth code flow
> In this quickstart, you download and run a code sample that demonstrates how a JavaScript React single-page application (SPA) can sign in users and call Microsoft Graph using the authorization code flow. The code sample demonstrates how to get an access token to call the Microsoft Graph API or any web API.

> ## Prerequisites
> 
> * Azure subscription - [Create an Azure subscription for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F)
> * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
> * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or another code editor

> #### Step 1: Configure your application in the Azure portal
> 
> This code samples requires a **Redirect URI** of `http://localhost:3000/`.

> > ![Already configured](media/quickstart-v2-javascript/green-check.png) Your application is configured with these attributes.
> 
> #### Step 2: Download the project
> 
> Run the project with a web server by using Node.js

> 
> #### Step 3: Your app is configured and ready to run
> We have configured your project with values of your app's properties.
> 
> #### Step 4: Run the project
> 
> Run the project with a web server by using Node.js:
> 
> 1. To start the server, run the following commands from within the project directory:
>     ```console
>     npm install
>     npm start
>     ```
> 1. Browse to `http://localhost:3000/`.
> 
> 1. Select **Sign In** to start the sign-in process and then call the Microsoft Graph API.
> 
>     The first time you sign in, you're prompted to provide your consent to allow the application to access your profile and sign you in. After you're signed in successfully, click on the **Request Profile Information** to display your profile information on the page.

> ### msal.js
> 
> The MSAL.js library signs in users and requests the tokens that are used to access an API that's protected by the Microsoft identity platform.
> 
> If you have Node.js installed, you can download the latest version by using the Node.js Package Manager (npm):

> ```console
> npm install @azure/msal-browser @azure/msal-react

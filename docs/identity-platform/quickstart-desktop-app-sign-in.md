---


## Configure the project

#### [Node.js Electron](#tab/node-js-workforce)

*Extract the project, open the *ms-identity-JavaScript-nodejs-desktop-main* folder, and then open *.authConfig.js* file. Replace the value as follows:

| Variable  |  Description | Example(s) |
|-----------|--------------|------------|
| `Enter_the_Cloud_Instance_Id_Here` | The Azure cloud instance in which your application is registered | `https://login.microsoftonline.com/` (include the trailing forward-slash)|
| `Enter_the_Tenant_Id_Here` | Tenant ID or Primary domain | `contoso.microsoft.com` or `aaaabbbb-0000-cccc-1111-dddd2222eeee` |
| `Enter_the_Application_Id_Here` | Client ID of the application you registered | `00001111-aaaa-2222-bbbb-3333cccc4444` |
| `Enter_the_Redirect_Uri_Here` | Redirect Uri of the application you registered | `msal00001111-aaaa-2222-bbbb-3333cccc4444://auth` |
| `Enter_the_Graph_Endpoint_Here` | The Microsoft Graph API cloud instance that your app will call | `https://graph.microsoft.com/`  (include the trailing forward-slash)|

Your file should look similar to below:

   ```javascript   
   const AAD_ENDPOINT_HOST = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/"; // include the trailing slash

   const msalConfig = {
       auth: {
           clientId: "00001111-aaaa-2222-bbbb-3333cccc4444",
           authority: `${AAD_ENDPOINT_HOST}/aaaabbbb-0000-cccc-1111-dddd2222eeee`,
       },
       system: {
           loggerOptions: {
               loggerCallback(loglevel, message, containsPii) {
                    console.log(message);
                },
                piiLoggingEnabled: false,
                logLevel: LogLevel.Verbose,
           }
       }
   }

   const GRAPH_ENDPOINT_HOST = "https://graph.microsoft.com/"; // include the trailing slash

   const protectedResources = {
        graphMe: {
            endpoint: `${GRAPH_ENDPOINT_HOST}v1.0/me`,
            scopes: ["User.Read"],
        }
   };

   module.exports = {
        msalConfig: msalConfig,
        protectedResources: protectedResources,
    };

   ```

#### [Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)](#tab/wpf-workforce)

1. Extract the zip file to a local folder close to the root of the disk, for example, **C:\Azure-Samples**.
1. Open the project in Visual Studio.
1. Edit **App.Xaml.cs** and replace the values of the fields `ClientId` and `Tenant` with the following code:

   ```csharp
   private static string ClientId = "Enter_the_Application_Id_here";
   private static string Tenant = "Enter_the_Tenant_Info_Here";
   ```

Where:
- `Enter_the_Application_Id_here` - is the **Application (client) ID** for the application you registered.
   
    To find the value of **Application (client) ID**, go to the app's **Overview** page in the Microsoft Entra admin center.
- `Enter_the_Tenant_Info_Here` - is set to one of the following options:
  - If your application supports **Accounts in this organizational directory**, replace this value with the **Tenant Id** or **Tenant name** (for example, contoso.microsoft.com)
  - If your application supports **Accounts in any organizational directory**, replace this value with `organizations`
  - If your application supports **Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts**, replace this value with `common`.

    To find the values of **Directory (tenant) ID** and **Supported account types**, go to the app's **Overview** page in the Microsoft Entra admin center.

## Run the application

#### [Node.js Electron](#tab/node-js-workforce)

1. You'll need to install the dependencies of this sample once:

    ```console
    cd ms-identity-javascript-nodejs-desktop-main
    npm install
    ```

1. Then, run the application via command prompt or console:

    ```console
    npm start
    ```

1. Select **Sign in** to start the sign-in process.

    The first time you sign in, you're prompted to provide your consent to allow the application to sign you in and access your profile. After you're signed in successfully, you'll be redirected back to the application.

#### [Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)](#tab/wpf-workforce)

To build and run the sample application in Visual Studio, follow these steps:

1. Select the **Debug menu** > **Start Debugging**, or press the F5 key. Your application's **MainWindow** is displayed.
1. Select the **Call Microsoft Graph API** button.
1. Sign in using your Microsoft Entra account (work or school account) or Microsoft account (live.com, outlook.com) credentials.
1. If you're running the application for the first time, you'll be prompted to provide consent to allow the application to access your user profile and sign you in. After consenting to the requested permissions, the application displays that you've successfully logged in.

You should see some basic token information and user data obtained from the call to the Microsoft Graph API.

#Customer intent: As an application developer I want to test the security and functionality of my ASP.NET Core web API endpoints to ensure they're properly protected and responsive to HTTP requests.

# Test a protected ASP.NET Core web API

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-workforce-external](../external-id/includes/applies-to-workforce-external.md)]

This tutorial is the final part of a series that demonstrates building and testing a protected web API registered in a Microsoft Entra tenant. In [Part 1 of this series](tutorial-web-api-dotnet-core-build-app.md), you created an ASP.NET Core web API and protected its endpoints. You'll now create a lightweight daemon app, register it in your tenant, and use the daemon app to test the web API you built.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> - Register a daemon app
> - Assign an app role to your daemon app
> - Build your daemon app
> - Run your daemon app to call the protected web API

## Prerequisites

- If you haven't already, complete the [Tutorial: Build and protect an ASP.NET Core web API with the Microsoft identity platform](tutorial-web-api-dotnet-core-build-app.md)

## Register the daemon app

[!INCLUDE [Register daemon app](../external-id/customers/includes/register-app/register-daemon-app.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Add app client secret](../external-id/customers/includes/register-app/add-app-client-secret.md)]

## Assign app role to your daemon app

Apps authenticating by themselves require app permissions.

1. From the **App registrations** page, select the daemon application that you created.
1. Under **Manage**, select **API permissions**.
1. Under **Configured permissions**, select **Add a permission**.
1. Select the **APIs my organization uses** tab.
1. In the list of APIs, select the web API you registered earlier.
1. Select **Application permissions** option. We select this option as the app signs in as itself, but not on behalf of a user. 
1. From the permissions list, select **Forecast.Read** (use the search box if necessary).
1. Select the **Add permissions** button.
1. At this point, you've assigned the permissions correctly. However, since the daemon app doesn't allow users to interact with it, users themselves can't consent to these permissions. To address this problem, you as the admin must consent to these permissions on behalf of all the users in the tenant:

    1. Select **Grant admin consent for \<your tenant name\>**, then select **Yes**.
    1. Select **Refresh**, then verify that **Granted for \<your tenant name\>** appears under **Status** for the permissions.

## Build a daemon app

1. Initialize a .NET console app and navigate to its root folder:

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet new console -o MyTestApp
    cd MyTestApp
    ```

1. Install MSAL.NET to help with handling authentication by running the following command:

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet add package Microsoft.Identity.Client
    ```

1. Run your API project and note the port on which it's running.
1. Open the *Program.cs* file and replace the "Hello world" code with the following code.

    ```csharp
    using System;
    using System.Net.Http;
    using System.Net.Http.Headers;

    HttpClient client = new HttpClient();

    var response = await client.GetAsync("http://localhost:<your-api-port>/weatherforecast");
    Console.WriteLine("Your response is: " + response.StatusCode);
    ```

    Navigate to the daemon app root directory and run app using the command `dotnet run`. This code sends a request without an access token. You should see the string: *Your response is: Unauthorized* printed in your console.
1. Remove the code in step 4 and replace with the following to test your API by sending a request with a valid access token. This daemon app uses the client credentials flow to acquire an access token as it authenticates without user interaction. 

    ```csharp
    using Microsoft.Identity.Client;
    using System;
    using System.Net.Http;
    using System.Net.Http.Headers;

    HttpClient client = new HttpClient();

    var clientId = "<your-daemon-app-client-id>";
    var clientSecret = "<your-daemon-app-secret>";
    var scopes = new[] {"api://<your-web-api-application-id>/.default"};
    var tenantName= "<your-tenant-name>";
    var authority = $"https://{tenantName}.ciamlogin.com/"; 

    var app = ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder
        .Create(clientId)
        .WithAuthority(authority)
        .WithClientSecret(clientSecret)
        .Build();

    var result = await app.AcquireTokenForClient(new string[] { scopes }).ExecuteAsync();
    Console.WriteLine($"Access Token: {result.AccessToken}");
    
    client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", result.AccessToken);
    var response = await client.GetAsync("http://localhost:/<your-api-port>/weatherforecast");
    var content = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
    
    Console.WriteLine("Your response is: " + response.StatusCode);
    Console.WriteLine(content);
    ```

    Navigate to the daemon app root directory and run app using the command `dotnet run`. This code sends a request with a valid access token. You should see the string: *Your response is: OK* printed in your console alongside some dummy weather forecast data from our minimal API.

    ```json
    Your response is: OK
    [{"date":"2025-03-01","temperatureC":45,"summary":"Warm","temperatureF":112},
    {"date":"2025-03-02","temperatureC":7,"summary":"Freezing","temperatureF":44},
    {"date":"2025-03-03","temperatureC":48,"summary":"Sweltering","temperatureF":118},
    {"date":"2025-03-04","temperatureC":-20,"summary":"Chilly","temperatureF":-3},
    {"date":"2025-03-05","temperatureC":12,"summary":"Scorching","temperatureF":53}]
    ```

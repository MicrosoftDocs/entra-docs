# Quickstart: Call a web API in a sample daemon app

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-workforce-external](../external-id/includes/applies-to-workforce-external.md)]

In this quickstart, you use a sample daemon application to acquire an access token and call a protected web API by using the [Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL)](msal-overview.md).

[!INCLUDE [select-tenant-type-statement](./includes/select-tenant-type-statement.md)]

::: zone pivot="workforce" 

The sample app you use in this quickstart acquires an access token to call Microsoft Graph API.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't already have one, [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

## Grant API permissions to the daemon app

For daemon app to access data in Microsoft Graph API, you grant it the permissions it needs. The daemon app needs application type permissions. Users can't interact with a daemon application, so the tenant administrator must consent to these permissions. Use the following steps to grant and consent to the permissions:

#### [.NET](#tab/asp-dot-net-core-workforce)

For the .NET daemon app, you don't need to grant and consent to any permission. This daemon app reads its own app registration information, so it can do so without being granted any application permissions.

## Configure the project

To use your app registration details in the client daemon app sample, use the following steps:

#### [.NET](#tab/asp-dot-net-core-workforce)

1. Open a console window then navigate to the *ms-identity-docs-code-dotnet/console-daemon* directory:

    ```console
    cd ms-identity-docs-code-dotnet/console-daemon
    ```

1. Open *Program.cs* and replace the file contents with the following snippet;

   ```csharp
    // Full directory URL, in the form of https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant_id>
    Authority = " https://login.microsoftonline.com/Enter_the_tenant_ID_obtained_from_the_Microsoft_Entra_admin_center",
    // 'Enter the client ID obtained from the Microsoft Entra admin center
    ClientId = "Enter the client ID obtained from the Microsoft Entra admin center",
    // Client secret 'Value' (not its ID) from 'Client secrets' in the Microsoft Entra admin center
    ClientSecret = "Enter the client secret value obtained from the Mifcrosoft Entra admin center",
    // Client 'Object ID' of app registration in Microsoft Entra admin center - this value is a GUID
    ClientObjectId = "Enter the client Object ID obtained from the Microsoft Entra admin center"
   ```

    * `Authority` - The authority is a URL that indicates a directory that MSAL can request tokens from. Replace *Enter_the_tenant_ID_obtained_from_the_Microsoft_Entra_admin_center* with the **Directory (tenant) ID** value that was recorded earlier.
    * `ClientId` - The identifier of the application, also referred to as the client. Replace the text in quotes with the `Application (client) ID` value that was recorded earlier from the overview page of the registered application.
    * `ClientSecret` - The client secret created for the application in the Microsoft Entra admin center. Enter the **value** of the client secret.
    * `ClientObjectId` - The object ID of the client application. Replace the text in quotes with the `Object ID` value that you recorded earlier from the overview page of the registered application.

#### [Node](#tab/node-workforce)

In your editor, open the *.env* file, then replace the placeholders:

- `Enter_the_Application_Id_Here` with the application (client) ID of the application you registered earlier.
- `Enter_the_Tenant_Id_Here` with the Tenant ID of your workforce tenant.
- `Enter_the_Client_Secret_Here` with the client secret you created earlier.
- `Enter_the_Cloud_Instance_Id_Here` with `https://login.microsoftonline.com`.
- `Enter_the_Graph_Endpoint_Here` with `https://graph.microsoft.com/`.

#### [Python](#tab/python-workforce)

1. Navigate to the *1-Call-MsGraph-WithSecret* directory.

1. In your editor, open the **parameters.json** file and replace the placeholders:

   - `Enter_the_Application_Id_Here` with the application (client) ID of the application you registered earlier.
   - `Enter_the_Tenant_Id_Here` with the Tenant ID of your workforce tenant.
   - `Enter_the_Client_Secret_Here` with the client secret you created earlier.

#### [Java](#tab/java-workforce)

1. Navigate to the `msal-client-credential-secret` directory.

1. In your editor, open the `src\main\resources\application.properties` file and replace the placeholders:

   - `Enter_the_Application_Id_Here` with the application (client) ID of the application you registered earlier.
   - `Enter_the_Tenant_Id_Here` with the Tenant ID of your workforce tenant.
   - `Enter_the_Client_Secret_Here` with the client secret you created earlier.

## Run and test the application

You've configured your sample app. You can proceed to run and test it.

#### [.NET](#tab/asp-dot-net-core-workforce)

From your console window, run the following command to build and run the application:

```console
dotnet run
```

Once the application runs successfully, it displays a response similar to the following snippet (shortened for brevity):

```console
{
"@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata#applications/$entity",
"id": "00001111-aaaa-2222-bbbb-3333cccc4444",
"deletedDateTime": null,
"appId": "00001111-aaaa-2222-bbbb-3333cccc4444",
"applicationTemplateId": null,
"disabledByMicrosoftStatus": null,
"createdDateTime": "2021-01-17T15:30:55Z",
"displayName": "identity-dotnet-console-app",
"description": null,
"groupMembershipClaims": null,
...
}
```

### How it works

A daemon application acquires a token on behalf of itself (not on behalf of a user). Users can't interact with a daemon application because it requires its own identity. This type of application requests an access token by using its application identity by presenting its application ID, credential (secret or certificate), and an application ID URI. The daemon application uses the standard [OAuth 2.0 client credentials grant flow](v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow.md) to acquire an access token.

The app acquires an access token from Microsoft identity platform. The access token is scoped for the Microsoft Graph API. The app then uses the access token to request its own application registration details from Microsoft Graph API. The app can request any resource from Microsoft Graph API as long as the access token has the right permissions.

The sample demonstrates how an unattended job or Windows service can run with an application identity, instead of a user's identity.

## Configure the sample daemon app and API

To use your app registration details in the client web app sample, use the following steps:

#### [Node](#tab/node-external)

1. In your code editor, open `App\authConfig.js` file.

1. Find the placeholder:

    - `Enter_the_Application_Id_Here` and replace it with the Application (client) ID of the daemon app you registered earlier.
     
    - `Enter_the_Tenant_Subdomain_Here` and replace it with the Directory (tenant) subdomain. For example, if your tenant primary domain is `contoso.onmicrosoft.com`, use `contoso`. If you don't have your tenant name, learn how to [read your tenant details](../external-id/customers/how-to-create-external-tenant-portal.md#get-the-external-tenant-details). 
    
    - `Enter_the_Client_Secret_Here` and replace it with the daemon app secret value you copied earlier.
    
    - `Enter_the_Web_Api_Application_Id_Here` and replace it with the Application (client) ID of the web API you copied earlier.

To use your app registration in the web API sample: 

1. In your code editor, open `API\ToDoListAPI\appsettings.json` file.

1. Find the placeholder:
    
    - `Enter_the_Application_Id_Here` and replace it with the Application (client) ID of the web API you copied.

    - `Enter_the_Tenant_Subdomain_Here` and replace it with the Directory (tenant) subdomain. For example, if your tenant primary domain is `contoso.onmicrosoft.com`, use `contoso`. If you don't have your tenant name, learn how to [read your tenant details](../external-id/customers/how-to-create-external-tenant-portal.md#get-the-external-tenant-details).

#### [.NET](#tab/asp-dot-net-core-external)

1. In your code editor, open *ms-identity-ciam-dotnet-tutorial/2-Authorization/3-call-own-api-dotnet-core-daemon/ToDoListClient/appsettings.json* file.

1. Find the placeholder:

    - `Enter_the_Application_Id_Here` and replace it with the Application (client) ID of the daemon application you registered earlier.
    - `Enter_the_Tenant_Subdomain_Here` and replace it with the Directory (tenant) subdomain. For example, if your tenant primary domain is `contoso.onmicrosoft.com`, use `contoso`. If you don't have your tenant name, learn how to [read your tenant details](../external-id/customers/how-to-create-external-tenant-portal.md#get-the-external-tenant-details).

##  Run and test sample daemon app and API 

You've configured your sample app. You can proceed to run and test it.

#### [Node](#tab/node-external)

1. Open a console window, then run the web API by using the following commands:

    ```console
    cd 2-Authorization\3-call-api-node-daemon\API\ToDoListAPI
    dotnet run
    ``` 
1. Run the web app client by using the following commands:

    ```console
    2-Authorization\3-call-api-node-daemon\App
    node . --op getToDos
    ```

If your daemon app and web API successfully run, you should see something similar to the following JSON array in your console window

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "owner": "3e8....-db63-43a2-a767-5d7db...",
    "description": "Pick up grocery"
},
{
    "id": 2,
    "owner": "c3cc....-c4ec-4531-a197-cb919ed.....",
    "description": "Finish invoice report"
},
{
    "id": 3,
    "owner": "a35e....-3b8a-4632-8c4f-ffb840d.....",
    "description": "Water plants"
}
```

### How it works

The Node.js app uses the [OAuth 2.0 client credentials grant flow](v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow.md) to acquire an access token for itself and not for the user. The access token that the app requests contains the permissions represented as roles. The client credential flow uses this set of permissions in place of user scopes for application tokens. You [exposed these application permissions](#configure-app-roles) in the web API earlier, then [granted them to the daemon app](#grant-api-permissions-to-the-daemon-app).

On the API side, a sample .NET web API, the API must verify that the access token has the required permissions (application permissions). The web API can't accept an access token that doesn't have the required permissions. 

### Access to data

A Web API endpoint should be prepared to accept calls from both users and applications. Therefore, it should have a way to respond to each request accordingly. For example, a call from a user via delegated permissions/scopes receives the user's data to-do list. On the other hand, a call from an application via application permissions/roles may receive the entire to-do list. However, in this article, we're only making an application call, so we didn't need to configure delegated permissions/scopes.


#### [.NET](#tab/asp-dot-net-core-external)

1. Open a console window, then run the web API by using the following commands:

    ```console
    cd 2-Authorization\3-call-own-api-dotnet-core-daemon\ToDoListAPI
    dotnet run
    ``` 
1. Run the daemon client by using the following commands:

    ```console
    cd 2-Authorization\3-call-own-api-dotnet-core-daemon\ToDoListClient
    dotnet run
    ```

    If your daemon application and web API successfully run, you should see something similar to the following JSON array in your console window:
    
    ```bash
    Posting a to-do...
    Retrieving to-do's from server...
    To-do data:
    ID: 1
    User ID: 00aa00aa-bb11-cc22-dd33-44ee44ee44ee

    ```

## How it works

The daemon application uses the [OAuth 2.0 client credentials grant flow](v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow.md) to acquire an access token for itself and not for the user. The access token that the app requests contains the permissions represented as roles. The client credential flow uses this set of permissions in place of user scopes for application tokens. You [exposed these application permissions](#configure-app-roles) in the web API earlier, then [granted them to the daemon app](#grant-api-permissions-to-the-daemon-app). The daemon app in this article uses [Microsoft Authentication Library for .NET](/entra/msal/dotnet/) to simplify the process of acquiring a token.

On the API side, a sample .NET web API, the API must verify that the access token has the required permissions (application permissions). The web API rejects access tokens that don't have the required permissions.

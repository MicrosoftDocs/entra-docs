# Deploy a web app in a pipeline and configure App Service authentication

This article describes how to set up a pipeline in [Azure Pipelines](/azure/devops/pipelines/) to build and deploy a web app to Azure and enable the [Azure App Service built-in authentication](/azure/app-service/overview-authentication-authorization).

You'll learn how to:

- Configure Azure resources using scripts in Azure Pipelines
- Build a web application and deploy to App Service using Azure Pipelines
- Create a Microsoft Entra app registration in Azure Pipelines
- Configure App Service built-in authentication in Azure Pipelines.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- An Azure DevOps organization. [Create one for free](/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/pipelines-sign-up).
    - To use Microsoft-hosted agents, your Azure DevOps organization must have access to Microsoft-hosted parallel jobs. [Check your parallel jobs and request a free grant](/azure/devops/pipelines/troubleshooting/troubleshooting#check-for-available-parallel-jobs).
- A Microsoft Entra [tenant](./quickstart-create-new-tenant.md).
- A [GitHub account](https://github.com) and Git [setup locally](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git).
- A minimum requirement of [.NET 6.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet).

## Create a sample ASP.NET Core web app

Create a sample app and push it to your GitHub repo.

### Create and clone a repo in GitHub

[Create a new repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo?tool=webui) in GitHub, specify a name like "PipelinesTest".  Set it to **Private** and add a *.gitignore* file with `.getignore template: VisualStudio`.

Open a terminal window and change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory:

```
cd c:\temp\
```

Enter the following command to clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/PipelinesTest
cd PipelinesTest
```

### Create an ASP.NET Core web app

1. Open a terminal window on your machine to a working directory. Create a new ASP.NET Core web app using the [dotnet new webapp](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-new#web-options) command, and then change directories into the newly created app.

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet new webapp -n PipelinesTest --framework net7.0
    cd PipelinesTest
    dotnet new sln
    dotnet sln add .
    ```

1. From the same terminal session, run the application locally using the dotnet run command.

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet run --urls=https://localhost:5001/
    ```

1. To verify the web app is running, open a web browser and navigate to the app at `https://localhost:5001`.

You see the template ASP.NET Core web app displayed in the page. 

:::image type="content" alt-text="Screen shot that shows web app running locally." source="./media/deploy-web-app-authentication-pipeline/web-app-local.png" border="true":::

Enter *CTRL-C* at the command line to stop running the web app.

### Push the sample to GitHub

Commit your changes and push to GitHub:

```
git add .
git commit -m "Initial check-in"
git push origin main
```

## Set up your Azure DevOps environment

Sign in to your Azure DevOps organization (`https://dev.azure.com/{yourorganization}`).

Create a new project:

1. Select **New project**.
1. Enter a **Project name**, such as "PipelinesTest".
1. Select **Private** visibility.
1. Select **Create**.

## Create a new pipeline

After the project is created, add a pipeline:

1. In the left navigation pane, select **Pipelines**->**Pipelines**, and then select **Create Pipeline**.
1. Select **GitHub  YAML**.  
1. On the **Connect** tab, select **GitHub YAML**. When prompted, enter your GitHub credentials.
1. When the list of repositories appears, select your `PipelinesTest` repository.
1. You might be redirected to GitHub to install the Azure Pipelines app. If so, select **Approve & install**.
1. In **Configure your pipeline**, select the **Starter pipeline**.
1. A new pipeline with a basic configuration appears. The default configuration uses a Microsoft-hosted agent.
1. When you're ready, select **Save and run**. To commit your changes to GitHub and start the pipeline, choose Commit directly to the main branch and select Save and run a second time. If prompted to grant permission with a message like **This pipeline needs permission to access a resource before this run can continue**, choose **View** and follow the prompts to permit access.

## Add a build stage and build tasks to your pipeline

Now that you have a working pipeline, you can add a build stage and build tasks in order to build the web app.  

Update *azure-pipelines.yml* and replace the basic pipeline configuration with the following:

[!code-yml[](includes/deploy-web-app-authentication-pipeline/azure-pipeline-1.yml)]

Save your changes and run the pipeline.

A stage `Build` is defined to build the web app. Under the `steps` section, you see various tasks to build the web app and publish artifacts to the pipeline.

- [NuGetToolInstaller@1](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/nuget-tool-installer-v1) acquires NuGet and adds it to the PATH. 
- [NuGetCommand@2](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/nuget-command-v2) restores NuGet packages in the solution.
- [VSBuild@1](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/vsbuild-v1) builds the solution with MSBuild and packages the app's build results (including its dependencies) as a .zip file into a folder.
- [PublishBuildArtifacts@1](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/publish-build-artifacts-v1) publishes the .zip file to Azure Pipelines.

## Create a service connection

Add a [service connection](/azure/devops/pipelines/library/service-endpoints) so your pipeline can connect and deploy resources to Azure:

1. Select **Project settings**.
1. In the left navigation pane, select **Service connections** and then **Create service connection**.
1. Select **Azure Resource Manager** and then **Next**.
1. Select **Service principal (automatic)** and then **Next**.
1. Select **Subscription** for **scope level** and select your Azure subscription.  Enter a service connection name such as "PipelinesTestServiceConnection" and select **Next**.  The service connection name is used in the following steps.

An application is also created in your Microsoft Entra tenant that provides an identity for the pipeline.  You need the display name of the app registration in later steps.  To find the display name:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least an [Application Developer](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#application-developer).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **App registrations** > **All applications**.
1. Find the display name of the app registration, which is of the form `{organization}-{project}-{guid}`.

Grant the service connection permission to access the pipeline:

1. In the left navigation pane, select **Project settings** and then **Service connections**.
1. Select the **PipelinesTestServiceConnection** service connection, then the **Ellipsis**, and then **Security** from the drop-down menu.
1. In the **Pipeline permissions** section, select **Add pipeline** and select the **PipelinesTest** service connection from the list.

## Add a variable group

The `DeployAzureResources` stage that you create in the next section uses several values to create and deploy resources to Azure:

- The Microsoft Entra tenant ID (find in the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/)).
- The region, or location, where the resources are deployed.
- A resource group name.
- The App Service service plan name.
- The name of the web app.
- The name of the service connection used to connect the pipeline to Azure. In the pipeline, this value is used for the Azure subscription.

Create a [variable group](/azure/devops/pipelines/library/variable-groups) and add values to use as variables in the pipeline.  

Select **Library** in the left navigation pane and create a new **Variable group**. Give it the name "AzureResourcesVariableGroup".

Add the following variables and values:

| Variable name | Example value |
| --- | --- |
| LOCATION | centralus |
| TENANTID |  {tenant-id}|
| RESOURCEGROUPNAME | pipelinetestgroup |
| SVCPLANNAME | pipelinetestplan |
| WEBAPPNAMETEST | pipelinetestwebapp |
| AZURESUBSCRIPTION | PipelinesTestServiceConnection |

Select **Save**.

Give the pipeline permissions to access the variable group.  In the variable group page, select **Pipeline permissions**, add your pipeline, and then close the window.

Update *azure-pipelines.yml* and add the variable group to the pipeline.

[!code-yml[](includes/deploy-web-app-authentication-pipeline/azure-pipeline-2.yml?highlight=1-2)]

Save your changes and run the pipeline.

## Deploy Azure resources

Next, add a stage to the pipeline that deploys Azure resources.  The pipeline uses an [inline script](/azure/devops/pipelines/scripts/powershell) to create the App Service instance.  In a later step, the inline script creates a Microsoft Entra app registration for App Service authentication.  An Azure CLI bash script is used because Azure Resource Manager (and Azure Pipelines tasks) can't create an app registration.

The inline script runs in the context of the pipeline, assign the [Application.Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#application-administrator) role to the app so the script can create app registrations:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Roles & admins** > **Roles & admins**.
1. Select **Application Administrator** from the list of built-in roles and then **Add assignment**.
1. Search for the pipeline app registration by display name.
1. Select the app registration from the list and select **Add**.

Update *azure-pipelines.yml* to add the inline script, which creates a resource group in Azure, creates an App Service plan, and creates an App Service instance.

[!code-yml[](includes/deploy-web-app-authentication-pipeline/azure-pipeline-3.yml?highlight=40-68)]

Save your changes and run the pipeline.  In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to **Resource groups** and verify that a new resource group and App Service instance are created.

## Deploy the web app to App Service

Now that your pipeline is creating resources in Azure, a deployment stage to deploy the web app to App Service.  

Update *azure-pipelines.yml* to add the deployment stage.

[!code-yml[](includes/deploy-web-app-authentication-pipeline/azure-pipeline-4.yml?highlight=70-96)]

Save your changes and run the pipeline.

A `DeployWebApp` stage is defined with several tasks:

- [DownloadBuildArtifacts@1](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/download-build-artifacts-v1) downloads the build artifacts that were published to the pipeline in a previous stage.
- [AzureRmWebAppDeployment@4](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/azure-rm-web-app-deployment-v4) deploys the web app to App Service.

View the deployed website on App Service. Navigate to your App Service and select the instance's **Default domain**: `https://pipelinetestwebapp.azurewebsites.net`.

The *pipelinetestwebapp* has been successfully deployed to App Service.

:::image type="content" alt-text="Screen shot that shows the web app running in Azure." source="./media/deploy-web-app-authentication-pipeline/web-app-azure.png" border="true":::

## Configure App Service authentication

Now that the pipeline is deploying the web app to App Service, you can configure the [App Service built-in authentication](/azure/app-service/overview-authentication-authorization).  Modify the inline script in the `DeployAzureResources` to:

1. Create a Microsoft Entra app registration as an identity for your web app. To create an app registration, the service principal for running the  pipeline needs Application Administrator role in the directory.
1. Get a secret from the app.
1. Configure the secret setting for the App Service web app.
1. Configure the redirect URI, home page URI, and issuer settings for the App Service web app.
1. Configure other settings on the web app.

[!code-yml[](includes/deploy-web-app-authentication-pipeline/azure-pipeline-5.yml?highlight=68-108)]

Save your changes and run the pipeline.

## Verify limited access to the web app

To verify that access to your app is limited to users in your organization, navigate to your App Service and select the instance's **Default domain**: `https://pipelinetestwebapp.azurewebsites.net`.

You should be directed to a secured sign-in page, verifying that unauthenticated users aren't allowed access to the site. Sign in as a user in your organization to gain access to the site. 

You can also start up a new browser and try to sign in by using a personal account to verify that users outside the organization don't have access.

## Clean up resources

Clean up your Azure resources and Azure DevOps environment so you're not charged for resources after you're done.

### Delete the resource group

Select **Resource groups** from the menu and select the resource group that contains your deployed web app.

Select **Delete resource group** to delete the resource group and all the resources.

### Disable the pipeline or delete the Azure DevOps project

You created a project that points to a GitHub repository. The pipeline is triggered to run every time you push a change to your GitHub repository, consuming free build minutes or your resources.

#### Option 1: Disable your pipeline

Choose this option if you want to keep your project and your build pipeline for future reference. You can re-enable your pipeline later if you need to.

1. In your Azure DevOps project, select **Pipelines** and then select your pipeline.
1. Select the ellipsis button at the far right, and then select **Settings**.
1. Select **Disabled**, and then select **Save**. Your pipeline will no longer process new run requests.

#### Option 2: Delete your project

Choose this option if you don't need your DevOps project for future reference. This deletes your Azure DevOps project.

1. Navigate to your Azure DevOps project.
1. Select **Project settings** in the lower-left corner.
1. Under **Overview**, scroll down to the bottom of the page and then select **Delete**.
1. Type your project name in the text box, and then select **Delete**.

### Delete app registrations in Microsoft Entra ID

In the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/), select **Identity** > **Applications** > **App registrations** > **All applications**.

Select the application for the pipeline, the display name has the form `{organization}-{project}-{guid}`, and delete it.

Select the application for the web app, *pipelinetestwebapp*, and delete it.

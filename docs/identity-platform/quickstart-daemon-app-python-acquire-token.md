# Quickstart: Acquire a token and call Microsoft Graph from a Python daemon app

In this quickstart, you download and run a code sample that demonstrates how a Python application can get an access token using the app's identity to call the Microsoft Graph API and display a [list of users](/graph/api/user-list) in the directory. The code sample demonstrates how an unattended job or Windows service can run with an application identity, instead of a user's identity. 

![Diagram showing how the sample app generated by this quickstart works.](media/quickstart-v2-python-daemon/python-console-daemon.svg)

## Prerequisites

To run this sample, you need:

- [Python 3+](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-364/)
- [MSAL Python](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-python)


## Register and download your quickstart app

#### Step 1: Register your application

[!INCLUDE [portal updates](~/includes/portal-update.md)]

To register your application and add the app's registration information to your solution manually, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com).
1. If you have access to multiple tenants, use the **Settings** icon :::image type="icon" source="media/common/admin-center-settings-icon.png" border="false"::: in the top menu to switch to the tenant in which you want to register the application from the **Directories + subscriptions** menu.
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **App registrations**, select **New registration**.
1. Enter a **Name** for your application, for example `Daemon-console`. Users of your app might see this name, and you can change it later.
1. Select **Register**.
1. Under **Manage**, select **Certificates & secrets**.
1. Under **Client secrets**, select **New client secret**, enter a name, and then select **Add**. Record the secret value in a safe location for use in a later step.
1. Under **Manage**, select **API Permissions** > **Add a permission**. Select **Microsoft Graph**.
1. Select **Application permissions**.
1. Under **User** node, select **User.Read.All**, then select **Add permissions**.

#### Step 2: Download the Python project

[Download the Python daemon project](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-python-daemon/archive/master.zip)

#### Step 3: Configure the Python project

1. Extract the zip file to a local folder close to the root of the disk, for example, **C:\Azure-Samples**.
1. Navigate to the sub folder **1-Call-MsGraph-WithSecret**.
1. Edit **parameters.json** and replace the values of the fields `authority`, `client_id`, and `secret` with the following snippet:

   ```json
   "authority": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/Enter_the_Tenant_Id_Here",
   "client_id": "Enter_the_Application_Id_Here",
   "secret": "Enter_the_Client_Secret_Here"
   ```
   Where:
   - `Enter_the_Application_Id_Here` - is the **Application (client) ID** for the application you registered.
   - `Enter_the_Tenant_Id_Here` - replace this value with the **Tenant Id** or **Tenant name** (for example, contoso.microsoft.com)
   - `Enter_the_Client_Secret_Here` - replace this value with the client secret created on step 1.

> [!TIP]
> To find the values of **Application (client) ID**, **Directory (tenant) ID**, go to the app's **Overview** page in the Microsoft Entra admin center. To generate a new key, go to **Certificates & secrets** page.


#### Step 4: Admin consent

If you try to run the application at this point, you'll receive *HTTP 403 - Forbidden* error: `Insufficient privileges to complete the operation`. This error happens because any *app-only permission* requires Admin consent: a Global Administrator of your directory must give consent to your application. Select one of the options below depending on your role:

##### Global tenant administrator

If you're a global tenant administrator, go to **API Permissions** page in **App registrations** in the Microsoft Entra admin center and select **Grant admin consent for {Tenant Name}** (Where {Tenant Name} is the name of your directory).


##### Standard user

If you're a standard user of your tenant, ask a global administrator to grant admin consent for your application. To do this, give the following URL to your administrator:

```url
https://login.microsoftonline.com/Enter_the_Tenant_Id_Here/adminconsent?client_id=Enter_the_Application_Id_Here
```

Where:
 * `Enter_the_Tenant_Id_Here` - replace this value with the **Tenant Id** or **Tenant name** (for example, contoso.microsoft.com)
 * `Enter_the_Application_Id_Here` - is the **Application (client) ID** for the application you registered previously.


#### Step 5: Run the application

You'll need to install the dependencies of this sample once.

```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, run the application via command prompt or console:

```console
python confidential_client_secret_sample.py parameters.json
```

You should see on the console output some JSON fragment representing a list of users in your Microsoft Entra directory.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This quickstart application uses a client secret to identify itself as confidential client. Because the client secret is added as a plain-text to your project files, for security reasons, it is recommended that you use a certificate instead of a client secret before considering the application as production application. For more information on how to use a certificate, see [these instructions](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-python-daemon/blob/master/2-Call-MsGraph-WithCertificate/README.md) in the same GitHub repository for this sample, but in the second folder **2-Call-MsGraph-WithCertificate**.

## More information

### MSAL Python

[MSAL Python](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-python) is the library used to sign in users and request tokens used to access an API protected by Microsoft identity platform. As described, this quickstart requests tokens by using the application own identity instead of delegated permissions. The authentication flow used in this case is known as *[client credentials oauth flow](v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow.md)*. For more information on how to use MSAL Python with daemon apps, see [this article](scenario-daemon-overview.md).

 You can install MSAL Python by running the following pip command.

```powershell
pip install msal
```

### MSAL initialization

You can add the reference for MSAL by adding the following code:

```Python
import msal
```

Then, initialize MSAL using the following code:

```Python
app = msal.ConfidentialClientApplication(
    config["client_id"], authority=config["authority"],
    client_credential=config["secret"])
```

| Where: |Description |
|---------|---------|
| `config["secret"]` | Is the client secret created for the application in Microsoft Entra admin center. |
| `config["client_id"]` | Is the **Application (client) ID** for the application registered in the Microsoft Entra admin center. You can find this value in the app's **Overview** page in the Microsoft Entra admin center. |
| `config["authority"]`    | The STS endpoint for user to authenticate. Usually `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}` for public cloud, where {tenant} is the name of your tenant or your tenant ID.|

For more information, please see the [reference documentation for `ConfidentialClientApplication`](https://msal-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#confidentialclientapplication).

### Requesting tokens

To request a token using app's identity, use `AcquireTokenForClient` method:

```Python
result = None
result = app.acquire_token_silent(config["scope"], account=None)

if not result:
    logging.info("No suitable token exists in cache. Let's get a new one from AAD.")
    result = app.acquire_token_for_client(scopes=config["scope"])
```

|Where:| Description |
|---------|---------|
| `config["scope"]` | Contains the scopes requested. For confidential clients, this should use the format similar to `{Application ID URI}/.default` to indicate that the scopes being requested are the ones statically defined in the app object set in the Microsoft Entra admin center (for Microsoft Graph, `{Application ID URI}` points to `https://graph.microsoft.com`). For custom web APIs, `{Application ID URI}` is defined under the **Expose an API** section in **App registrations** in the Microsoft Entra admin center.|

For more information, please see the [reference documentation for `AcquireTokenForClient`](https://msal-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#msal.ConfidentialClientApplication.acquire_token_for_client).

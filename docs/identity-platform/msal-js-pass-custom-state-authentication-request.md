# Pass custom state in authentication requests using MSAL.js

The *state* parameter, as defined by OAuth 2.0, is included in an authentication request and is also returned in the token response to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks. By default, the Microsoft Authentication Library for JavaScript (MSAL.js) passes a randomly generated unique *state* parameter value in the authentication requests.

The state parameter can also be used to encode information of the app's state before redirect. You can pass the user's state in the app, such as the page or view they were on, as input to this parameter. The MSAL.js library allows you to pass your custom state as state parameter in the [Request](https://azuread.github.io/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/ref/modules/_azure_msal_browser.html#redirectrequest) object. For example:

```javascript
import {PublicClientApplication} from "@azure/msal-browser";

const myMsalObj = new PublicClientApplication({
    clientId: "ENTER_CLIENT_ID_HERE"
});

let loginRequest = {
    scopes: ["user.read"],
    state: "page_url"
}

myMSALObj.loginRedirect(loginRequest);
```

The passed in state is appended to the unique GUID set by MSAL.js when sending the request. When the response is returned, MSAL.js checks for a state match and then returns the custom passed in state in the [Response](https://azuread.github.io/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/ref/modules/_azure_msal_common.html#authenticationresult) object as `state`.

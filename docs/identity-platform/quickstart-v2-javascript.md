# Quickstart: Sign in users and get an access token in a JavaScript SPA

In this quickstart, you download and run a code sample that demonstrates how a JavaScript single-page application (SPA) can sign in users and call Microsoft Graph. The code sample also demonstrates how to get an access token to call the Microsoft Graph API or any web API.

See [How the sample works](#how-the-sample-works) for an illustration.

> [!div renderon="docs"]
>
> Where:
> - *\<Enter_the_Graph_Endpoint_Here>* is the endpoint that API calls will be made against. For the main or global Microsoft Graph API service, simply enter `https://graph.microsoft.com/`. For more information, see [National cloud deployment](/graph/deployments)
>
> #### Step 4: Run the project

Run the project with a web server by using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/):

1. To start the server, run the following command from the project directory:
    ```cmd
    npm install
    npm start
    ```
1. Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000/`.

1. Select **Sign In** to start the sign-in, and then call Microsoft Graph API.

After the browser loads the application, select **Sign In**. The first time that you sign in, you're prompted to provide your consent to allow the application to access your profile and to sign you in. After you're signed in successfully, your user profile information should be displayed on the page.

## More information

### How the sample works

![How the sample JavaScript SPA works: 1. The SPA initiates sign in. 2. The SPA acquires an ID token from the Microsoft identity platform. 3. The SPA calls acquire token. 4. The Microsoft identity platform returns an Access token to the SPA. 5. The SPA makes and HTTP GET request with the Access Token to the Microsoft Graph API. 6. The Graph API returns an HTTP response to the SPA.](media/quickstart-v2-javascript/javascriptspa-intro.svg)

### msal.js

The MSAL library signs in users and requests the tokens that are used to access an API that's protected by Microsoft identity platform. The quickstart *index.html* file contains a reference to the library:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://alcdn.msftauth.net/lib/1.2.1/js/msal.js" integrity="sha384-9TV1245fz+BaI+VvCjMYL0YDMElLBwNS84v3mY57pXNOt6xcUYch2QLImaTahcOP" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

You can replace the preceding version with the latest released version under [MSAL.js releases](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/releases).

Alternatively, if you have Node.js installed, you can download the latest version through Node.js Package Manager (npm):

```cmd
npm install msal
```

### MSAL initialization

The quickstart code also shows how to initialize the MSAL library:

```javascript
  // Config object to be passed to Msal on creation
  const msalConfig = {
    auth: {
      clientId: "00001111-aaaa-2222-bbbb-3333cccc4444", // this is a fake id
      authority: "https://login.microsoftonline.com/common",
      redirectUri: "http://localhost:3000/",
    },
    cache: {
      cacheLocation: "sessionStorage", // This configures where your cache will be stored
      storeAuthStateInCookie: false, // Set this to "true" if you are having issues on IE11 or Edge
    }
  };

const myMSALObj = new Msal.UserAgentApplication(msalConfig);
```

|Where  | Description |
|---------|---------|
|`clientId`     | The application ID of the application that's registered in the Azure portal.|
|`authority`    | (Optional) The authority URL that supports account types, as described previously in the configuration section. The default authority is `https://login.microsoftonline.com/common`. |
|`redirectUri`     | The application registration's configured reply/redirectUri. In this case, `http://localhost:3000/`. |
|`cacheLocation`  | (Optional) Sets the browser storage for the auth state. The default is sessionStorage.   |
|`storeAuthStateInCookie`  | (Optional) The library that stores the authentication request state that's required for validation of the authentication flows in the browser cookies. This cookie is set for IE and Edge browsers to mitigate certain [known issues](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/wiki/Known-issues-on-IE-and-Edge-Browser#issues). |

For more information about available configurable options, see [Initialize client applications](msal-js-initializing-client-applications.md).

### Sign in users

The following code snippet shows how to sign in users:

```javascript
// Add scopes for the id token to be used at Microsoft identity platform endpoints.
const loginRequest = {
    scopes: ["openid", "profile", "User.Read"],
};

myMSALObj.loginPopup(loginRequest)
    .then((loginResponse) => {
    //Login Success callback code here
}).catch(function (error) {
    console.log(error);
});
```

|Where  | Description |
|---------|---------|
| `scopes`   | (Optional) Contains scopes that are being requested for user consent at sign-in time. For example, `[ "user.read" ]` for Microsoft Graph or `[ "<Application ID URL>/scope" ]` for custom web APIs (that is, `api://<Application ID>/access_as_user`). |

Alternatively, you might want to use the `loginRedirect` method to redirect the current page to the sign-in page instead of a pop-up window.

### Request tokens

MSAL uses three methods to acquire tokens: `acquireTokenRedirect`, `acquireTokenPopup`, and `acquireTokenSilent`

#### Get a user token silently

The `acquireTokenSilent` method handles token acquisitions and renewal without any user interaction. After the `loginRedirect` or `loginPopup` method is executed for the first time, `acquireTokenSilent` is the method commonly used to obtain tokens that are used to access protected resources for subsequent calls. Calls to request or renew tokens are made silently.

```javascript

const tokenRequest = {
    scopes: ["Mail.Read"]
};

myMSALObj.acquireTokenSilent(tokenRequest)
    .then((tokenResponse) => {
        // Callback code here
        console.log(tokenResponse.accessToken);
    }).catch((error) => {
        console.log(error);
    });
```

|Where  | Description |
|---------|---------|
| `scopes`   | Contains scopes being requested to be returned in the access token for API. For example, `[ "mail.read" ]` for Microsoft Graph or `[ "<Application ID URL>/scope" ]` for custom web APIs (that is, `api://<Application ID>/access_as_user`).|

#### Get a user token interactively

There are situations where you force users to interact with the Microsoft identity platform. For example:
* Users might need to reenter their credentials because their password has expired.
* Your application is requesting access to additional resource scopes that the user needs to consent to.
* Two-factor authentication is required.

The usual recommended pattern for most applications is to call `acquireTokenSilent` first, then catch the exception, and then call `acquireTokenPopup` (or `acquireTokenRedirect`) to start an interactive request.

Calling the `acquireTokenPopup` results in a pop-up window for signing in. (Or `acquireTokenRedirect` results in redirecting users to the Microsoft identity platform). In that window, users need to interact by confirming their credentials, giving the consent to the required resource, or completing the two-factor authentication.

```javascript
// Add here scopes for access token to be used at MS Graph API endpoints.
const tokenRequest = {
    scopes: ["Mail.Read"]
};

myMSALObj.acquireTokenPopup(requestObj)
    .then((tokenResponse) => {
        // Callback code here
        console.log(tokenResponse.accessToken);
    }).catch((error) => {
        console.log(error);
    });
```

> [!NOTE]
> This quickstart uses the `loginRedirect` and `acquireTokenRedirect` methods with Microsoft Internet Explorer, because of a [known issue](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/wiki/Known-issues-on-IE-and-Edge-Browser#issues) related to the handling of pop-up windows by Internet Explorer.

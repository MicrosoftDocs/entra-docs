# Desktop app that calls web APIs: Acquire a token using username and password

In your desktop applications, you can use the username and password flow, also known as Resource Owner Password Credentials (ROPC), to acquire a token silently.

>[!WARNING]
> The username and password flow is **not recommended** as the application will be asking a user for their password directly, which is an insecure pattern. For more information about the risks and challenges the ROPC flow poses, refer to ["Whatâ€™s the solution to the growing problem of passwords?](https://news.microsoft.com/features/whats-solution-growing-problem-passwords-says-microsoft/).

Additionally, by using a username and password, developers give up a number of things, including:

- Core tenets of modern identity - A password can get phished and replayed because a shared secret can be intercepted.
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) - Users can't sign in because there's no interaction.
- Single sign-on (SSO) capabilities.

The username and password flow also has the following constraints:

- The username and password flow isn't compatible with Conditional Access and multi-factor authentication. If your app runs in a Microsoft Entra tenant where the admin requires multi-factor authentication, like most organizations do, you can't use this flow.
- It only works for work and school accounts, not personal Microsoft Accounts.
- The flow is available on .NET desktop and .NET, but not on UWP.

Using a username and password is useful in some cases, such as DevOps scenarios. However, if you want to use a username and password in interactive scenarios where you provide your own UI, consider moving away from it.

The preferred flow for acquiring a token silently on Windows is using the [Windows authentication broker](scenario-desktop-acquire-token-wam.md). Alternatively, developers can also use the [Device code flow](/entra/msal/dotnet/acquiring-tokens/desktop-mobile/device-code-flow) on devices without access to the web browser.

If you're building a desktop application that signs in users with social identities using the Resource Owner Password Credentials (ROPC) flow, see [how to sign in users with social identities by using Azure AD B2C](/entra/msal/dotnet/acquiring-tokens/desktop-mobile/social-identities)


## Use the ROPC flow

# [.NET](#tab/dotnet)

`IPublicClientApplication`contains the method `AcquireTokenByUsernamePassword`.

The following sample presents a simplified case.

```csharp
static async Task GetATokenForGraph()
{
 string authority = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/contoso.com";
 string[] scopes = new string[] { "user.read" };
 IPublicClientApplication app;
 app = PublicClientApplicationBuilder.Create(clientId)
       .WithAuthority(authority)
       .Build();
 var accounts = await app.GetAccountsAsync();

 AuthenticationResult result = null;
 if (accounts.Any())
 {
  result = await app.AcquireTokenSilent(scopes, accounts.FirstOrDefault())
                    .ExecuteAsync();
 }
 else
 {
  try
  {
   var securePassword = new SecureString();
   foreach (char c in "dummy")        // you should fetch the password
    securePassword.AppendChar(c);  // keystroke by keystroke

   result = await app.AcquireTokenByUsernamePassword(scopes,
                                                    "joe@contoso.com",
                                                     securePassword)
                      .ExecuteAsync();
  }
  catch(MsalException)
  {
   // See details below
  }
 }
 Console.WriteLine(result.Account.Username);
}
```

The following sample presents the most current case, with explanations of the kind of exceptions you can get and their mitigations.

```csharp
static async Task GetATokenForGraph()
{
 string authority = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/contoso.com";
 string[] scopes = new string[] { "user.read" };
 IPublicClientApplication app;
 app = PublicClientApplicationBuilder.Create(clientId)
                                   .WithAuthority(authority)
                                   .Build();
 var accounts = await app.GetAccountsAsync();

 AuthenticationResult result = null;
 if (accounts.Any())
 {
  result = await app.AcquireTokenSilent(scopes, accounts.FirstOrDefault())
                    .ExecuteAsync();
 }
 else
 {
  try
  {
   var securePassword = new SecureString();
   foreach (char c in "dummy")        // you should fetch the password keystroke
    securePassword.AppendChar(c);  // by keystroke

   result = await app.AcquireTokenByUsernamePassword(scopes,
                                                    "joe@contoso.com",
                                                    securePassword)
                    .ExecuteAsync();
  }
  catch (MsalUiRequiredException ex) when (ex.Message.Contains("AADSTS65001"))
  {
   // Here are the kind of error messages you could have, and possible mitigations

   // Mitigation: you need to get user consent first. This can be done either statically (through the portal),
   /// or dynamically (but this requires an interaction with Azure AD, which is not possible with
   // the username/password flow)
   // Statically: in the portal by doing the following in the "API permissions" tab of the application registration:
   // 1. Click "Add a permission" and add all the delegated permissions corresponding to the scopes you want (for instance
   // User.Read and User.ReadBasic.All)
   // 2. Click "Grant/revoke admin consent for <tenant>") and click "yes".
   // Dynamically, if you are not using .NET (which does not have any Web UI) by
   // calling (once only) AcquireTokenInteractive.
   // remember that Username/password is for public client applications that is desktop/mobile applications.
   // If you are using .NET or don't want to call AcquireTokenInteractive, you might want to:
   // - use device code flow (See https://aka.ms/msal-net-device-code-flow)

# [macOS](#tab/macOS)

The ROPC flow isn't supported on MSAL for macOS.

# [Node.js](#tab/nodejs)

This extract is from the [MSAL Node dev samples](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/samples/msal-node-samples/username-password). In the following code snippet, the username and password are hardcoded for illustration purposes only. This should be avoided in production. Instead, a basic UI prompting the user to enter her username/password would be recommended.

```javascript
const msal = require("@azure/msal-node");

const msalConfig = {
    auth: {
        clientId: "your_client_id_here",
        authority: "your_authority_here",
    }
};

const pca = new msal.PublicClientApplication(msalConfig);

// For testing, enter your username and password below.
// In production, replace this with a UI prompt instead.
const usernamePasswordRequest = {
    scopes: ["user.read"],
    username: "", // Add your username here
    password: "", // Add your password here
};

pca.acquireTokenByUsernamePassword(usernamePasswordRequest).then((response) => {
    console.log("acquired token by password grant");
}).catch((error) => {
    console.log(error);
});
```

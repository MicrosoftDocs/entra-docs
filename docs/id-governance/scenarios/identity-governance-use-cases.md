# Microsoft Entra ID Governance use cases

Microsoft Entra ID Governance allows you to balance your organization's need for security and employee productivity with the right processes and visibility.  In order to achieve this balance, the following identity governance use cases need to be considered.   


## Use cases in Microsoft Entra ID Governance:
Here are typical identity governance use cases:


- **[Govern the employee, guest and partner lifecycle](govern-the-employee-lifecycle.md)** - Governing the employee lifecycle or **Identity lifecycle management** is the foundation for Identity Governance, and effective governance at scale requires modernizing the identity lifecycle management infrastructure for applications.  Similar processes are also needed for additional identities, for partners, suppliers and other guests, to enable them to collaborate or have access to resources.    

- **[Govern access to applications](../identity-governance-applications-prepare.md)** -  - Organizations need a process to manage access beyond what was initially provisioned for a user when that user's identity was created. Furthermore, enterprise organizations need to be able to scale efficiently to be able to develop and enforce access policy and controls on an ongoing basis.  An organization's controls for managing access specific to applications.

These use cases demonstrate the breadth and importance of identity governance in maintaining security, compliance, and efficient user management within organizations.

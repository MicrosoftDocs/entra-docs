#CustomerIntent: As a system administrator, I want to view insights across my environment so that I know which workflows, or tasks, are being used the most.

# Check Workflow Insights (preview)

With Workflow Insights, you're able to get a quick view of workflow execution within your environment. With Workflow Insights, you can view information such as:

- Numerical summaries of all successful workflows, users processed, and successful tasks that ran in your environment.
- The top workflows of the past time-span that you define from either 7, 14, or 30 days.
- The top tasks of the past time-span that you define from either 7, 14, or 30 days.
- Number of workflows by categories of the past time-span that you define from either 7, 14, or 30 days.


For more information, see: [Workflow Insights (preview)](lifecycle-workflow-insights.md).

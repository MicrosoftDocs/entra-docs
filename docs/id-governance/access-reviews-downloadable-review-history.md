# Create and manage downloadable access review history report in Microsoft Entra access reviews

With access reviews, you can create a downloadable review history to help your organization gain more insight. The report pulls the decisions taken by reviewers when a report is created. These reports can be constructed to include specific access reviews, for a specific time frame, and can be filtered to include different review types and review results.
 
## Who can access and request review history

Review history and request review history are available for any user if they're authorized to view access reviews. To see which roles can view and create access reviews, see [What resource types can be reviewed?](deploy-access-reviews.md#what-resource-types-can-be-reviewed). Global Administrator, Identity Governance Administrator, and Global Reader can see history reports for all access reviews. All other users are only allowed to see reports on access reviews that they generate.

## How to create a review history report

**Prerequisite role:** All users authorized to view access reviews

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least an [Identity Governance Administrator](../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#identity-governance-administrator).

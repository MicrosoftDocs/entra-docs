# Delegated Workflow Management (Preview)

Workflows by default, unless specified during creation, are managed by users with either the Lifecycle Workflows, or Global, administrator roles. As workflows grow and change to meet the needs of members of your organization, so does the need to limit who can manage them. With delegated workflow management, you can scope management of workflows using [Administrative Units](../identity/role-based-access-control/administrative-units.md). When scoped, specific admins are only granted access to manage specific workflows. This allows for greater security within your environment by following Microsoft's least privileged access guidelines by only giving access to specifically what's needed.

The following table shows the differences between the Lifecycle Workflows Administrator role, and the scoped workflow administrator role in terms of Lifecycle workflow capabilities:


|Capability | Lifecycle Workflows Administrator  | Workflow Administrator  |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|------------------------|
|[Create Workflow](create-lifecycle-workflow.md)    | Yes | No |
|[Edit Workflow](manage-workflow-properties.md)    | Yes | Yes (only assigned workflows) |
|[Custom Task Extensions](trigger-custom-task.md)    | Yes | No |
|[Delete Workflow](delete-lifecycle-workflow.md#delete-a-workflow-by-using-the-microsoft-entra-admin-center)    | Yes | Yes (only assigned workflows) |
|[Restore Workflow](delete-lifecycle-workflow.md#view-deleted-workflows-in-the-microsoft-entra-admin-center)     | Yes | Yes (only assigned workflows) |
|[View workflow history](lifecycle-workflow-history.md)     | Yes | Yes (only assigned workflows) |
|[Run Workflow on-demand](on-demand-workflow.md)    | Yes | Yes (only assigned workflows) |
|[Scope Workflows](manage-delegate-workflow.md#edit-the-administrative-scopes-of-a-workflow-using-the-microsoft-entra-admin-center)     | Yes | No |

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Entra ID Governance license](~/includes/entra-entra-governance-license.md)] You must also have at least one administrative unit within your tenant. For steps on creating an administrative unit, see [Create an administrative unit](../identity/role-based-access-control/admin-units-manage.md#create-an-administrative-unit). You must als

With an administrative unit created, you can

To use this feature, you will first need to assign Lifecycle workflow admins to an administrative unit scope, you will need to configure the scope via Graph API (UI portal support not available on private preview).
The info you will need is:
Lifecycle Workflow admin role id: 59d46f88-662b-457b-bceb-5c3809e5908f
User Id for user you want to assign the scope
ID of Admin Unit you want to assign
Example POST call:
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/roleManagement/directory/roleAssignments
{
    "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.unifiedRoleAssignment",
    "principalId": "<Object ID of user>",
    "roleDefinitionId": "59d46f88-662b-457b-bceb-5c3809e5908f",
    "directoryScopeId": "/administrativeUnits/<Object ID of administrative unit>"
}

## Assign Lifecycle Workflows Administrator role to administrative unit

To delegate workflow management using administrative scopes, you must first assign the Lifecycle Workflows administrator role to the administrative unit. To do so, you'd follow these steps:

> [!TIP]
> While the following steps walk you through setting the role for a specific user, you can set the role to a group within the administrative unit to delegate management within a scope to multiple users.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Privileged Role Administrator](../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#privileged-role-administrator).

1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Users**.

1. On the users page, select the user you want to assign the admin scope to.

1. From the user overview page, select **Assigned roles**.

1. On the assigned roles page, select **Add assignments**.

1. On the add assignments page select the following:<br>
    **Select role**: Lifecycle Workflows Administrator<br>
    **Scope type**: Administrative unit
    :::image type="content" source="media/manage-delegate-workflow/add-administrative-unit.png" alt-text="Screenshot of adding administrative unit.":::
1. On the **Selected scope** pane, select the administrative unit where your workflow will be scoped to, and select **Next**.

1. On the **Setting** tab, you can set the assignment as either **Eligible** or **Active**.
    > [!NOTE]
    > Assignment must be active to run for users in the administrative unit.
1. Select **Save**.

### Assign Lifecycle Workflows Administrator role to administrative unit programmatically 

To assign Lifecycle workflow admins to an administrative unit scope via API, you must have the following information:

- Lifecycle Workflow admin role id: 59d46f88-662b-457b-bceb-5c3809e5908f
- User Id for user you want to assign the scope
- ID of Admin Unit you want to assign


With this information, you can make the following API call:

POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/roleManagement/directory/roleAssignments

```
{
    "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.unifiedRoleAssignment",
    "principalId": "<Object ID of user>",
    "roleDefinitionId": "59d46f88-662b-457b-bceb-5c3809e5908f",
    "directoryScopeId": "/administrativeUnits/<Object ID of administrative unit>"
}
```

## Add administrative scopes to a new workflow

To add an administrative scope to a new workflow, set the administrative scope during workflow creation by doing the following steps:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Lifecycle Workflows Administrator](../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#lifecycle-workflows-administrator).

1. Browse to **ID Governance** > **Lifecycle workflows** > **Create a workflow**.

1. On the **Choose a workflow** page, select the workflow template that you want to use.

1. On the **Basics** tab, enter a unique display name, description, and administrative scope for the workflow, and then select **Next**. 
    :::image type="content" source="media/manage-delegate-workflow/create-admin-scope.png" alt-text="Screenshot of setting admin scope of a new workflow.":::
1. Finish setting the execution conditions, tasks, and create the workflow.

> [!NOTE]
> You can assign up to five administrative scopes per workflow.

## Edit the administrative scopes of an existing workflow using the Microsoft Entra admin center

With the role set for admins over the administrative unit, you must edit the workflow to be assigned within the scope of that administrative unit. To edit the properties of a workflow to be in an administrative unit's scope using the Microsoft Entra admin center, you do the following steps:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Lifecycle Workflows Administrator](../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#lifecycle-workflows-administrator).

1. Browse to **ID Governance** > **Lifecycle workflows** > **workflows**.

1. On the list of workflows page, select the workflow that you want to edit the administrative scopes of.

1. On the workflow overview page, select **Properties**.

1. Under properties, select **Administrative Scope**.

1. From the administrative scopes pane, you can see the list of all administrative units in your tenant. 

1. Select the administrative unit(s) you want to scope the workflow to. 

1. Select **Save**.

## View the administrative scopes of a workflow using the Microsoft Entra admin center

When managing workflows, it's important to see what administrative scopes they fall under. This allows you to quickly see who can manage each specific workflow. To see the administrative scopes of a workflow, do the following steps:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Lifecycle Workflows Administrator](../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#lifecycle-workflows-administrator).

1. Browse to **ID Governance** > **Lifecycle workflows** > **workflows**.

1. On the workflow list screen, you can see the number of scopes assigned to the workflow under the **Administration scope assigned** column.

1. Select the number in the column to see the list of scopes assigned to that workflow.


## Remove the administrative scopes of a workflow using the Microsoft Entra admin center

Administration scopes can be removed from a workflow at any time. To remove an administrative unit scope from a workflow, do the following steps:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Lifecycle Workflows Administrator](../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#lifecycle-workflows-administrator).

1. Browse to **ID Governance** > **Lifecycle workflows** > **workflows**.

1. On the list of workflows page, select the workflow that you want to remove an administrative scope from.

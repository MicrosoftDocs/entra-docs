# Create an access package in entitlement management

An access package enables you to do a one-time setup of resources and policies that automatically administers access for the life of the access package. This article describes how to create an access package.

## Overview

All access packages must be in a container called a catalog. A catalog defines what resources you can add to your access package. If you don't specify a catalog, your access package goes in the general catalog. Currently, you can't move an existing access package to a different catalog.

An access package can be used to assign access to roles of multiple resources that are in the catalog. If you're an administrator or catalog owner, you can add resources to the catalog while you're creating an access package. You can also add resources after the access package is created, and users assigned to the access package will also receive the extra resources.

If you're an access package manager, you can't add resources that you own to a catalog. You're restricted to using the resources available in the catalog. If you need to add resources to a catalog, you can ask the catalog owner.

All access packages must have at least one policy for users to be assigned to them. Policies specify who can request the access package, along with approval and lifecycle settings, or how access is automatically assigned. When you create an access package, you can create an initial policy for users in your directory, for users not in your directory, or for administrator direct assignments only.

Here are the high-level steps to create an access package with an initial policy:

1. In Identity Governance, start the process to create an access package.

1. Select the catalog where you want to put the access package and ensure that it has the necessary resources.

1. Add resource roles from resources in the catalog to your access package.

1. Specify an initial policy for users who can request access.

1. Specify approval settings and lifecycle settings in that policy.

Then once the access package is created, you can [change the hidden setting](entitlement-management-access-package-edit.md#change-the-hidden-setting), [add or remove resource roles](entitlement-management-access-package-resources.md), and [add additional policies](entitlement-management-access-package-request-policy.md).

## Start the creation process

[!INCLUDE [portal updates](../includes/portal-update.md)]

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least an [Identity Governance Administrator](../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#identity-governance-administrator).
    > [!TIP]
    > Other least privilege roles that can complete this task include the Catalog owner or Access Package manager.
1. Browse to **Identity governance** > **Entitlement management** > **Access package**.

1. Select **New access package**.

    ![Screenshot that shows the button for creating a new access package in the Microsoft Entra admin center.](./media/entitlement-management-shared/access-packages-list.png)

## Configure basics

On the **Basics** tab, you give the access package a name and specify which catalog to create the access package in.

1. Enter a display name and description for the access package. Users see this information when they submit a request for the access package.

1. In the **Catalog** dropdown list, select the catalog where you want to put the access package. For example, you might have a catalog owner who manages all the marketing resources that can be requested. In this case, you could select the marketing catalog.

    You see only catalogs that you have permission to create access packages in. To create an access package in an existing catalog, you must be at least an Identity Governance Administrator. Or you must be a catalog owner or access package manager in that catalog.

    ![Screenshot that shows basic information for a new access package.](./media/entitlement-management-access-package-create/basics.png)

    If you're at least an Identity Governance Administrator, or catalog creator, and you want to create your access package in a new catalog that's not listed, select **Create new catalog**. Enter the catalog name and description, and then select **Create**.

    The access package that you're creating, and any resources included in it, are added to the new catalog. Later, you can add more catalog owners or add attributes to the resources that you put in the catalog. To learn more about how to edit the attributes list for a specific catalog resource and the prerequisite roles, read [Add resource attributes in the catalog](entitlement-management-catalog-create.md#add-resource-attributes-in-the-catalog).

1. Select **Next: Resource roles**.

## Select resource roles

On the **Resource roles** tab, you select the resources to include in the access package. Users who request and receive the access package receive all the resource roles, such as group membership, in the access package.

If you're not sure which resource roles to include, you can skip adding them while creating the access package, and then [add them](entitlement-management-access-package-resources.md) later.

1. Select the resource type that you want to add (**Groups and Teams**, **Applications**, or **SharePoint sites**).

1. In the **Select applications** panel that appears, select one or more resources from the list.

    ![Screenshot that shows the panel for selecting applications for resource roles in a new access package.](./media/entitlement-management-access-package-create/resource-roles.png)

    If you're creating the access package in the general catalog or a new catalog, you can choose any resource from the directory that you own. You must be at least an Identity Governance Administrator, or catalog creator.

    >[!NOTE]
    >You can add dynamic groups to a catalog and to an access package. However, you can select only the owner role when you're managing a dynamic group resource in an access package.

    If you're creating the access package in an existing catalog, you can select any resource that's already in the catalog without needing to be an owner of that resource.

    If you're at least an Identity Governance Administrator, or catalog owner, you have the additional option of selecting resources that you own or administer but that aren't yet in the catalog. If you select resources in the directory but not currently in the selected catalog, these resources are also added to the catalog for other catalog administrators to build access packages with. To see all the resources in the directory that can be added to the catalog, select the **See all** checkbox at the top of the panel. If you want to select only resources that are currently in the selected catalog, leave the **See all** checkbox cleared (the default state).

1. In the **Role** list, select the role that you want users to be assigned for the resource. For more information on selecting the appropriate roles for a resource, see [how to determine which resource roles to include in an access package](entitlement-management-access-package-resources.md#determine-which-resource-roles-to-include-in-an-access-package).

    ![Screenshot that shows resource role selection for a new access package.](./media/entitlement-management-access-package-create/resource-roles-role.png)

1. Select **Next: Requests**.


## Create request policies

On the **Requests** tab, you create the first policy to specify who can request the access package. You also configure approval settings. Later, you can create more request policies to allow additional groups of users to request the access package with their own approval settings.

![Screenshot that shows the Requests tab for a new access package.](./media/entitlement-management-access-package-create/requests.png)

Depending on which users you want to be able to request this access package, perform the steps in one of the following sections.

[!INCLUDE [Entitlement management request policy](../includes/entra-entitlement-management-request-policy.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Entitlement management lifecycle policy](../includes/entra-entitlement-management-lifecycle-policy.md)]

## Review and create the access package

On the **Review + create** tab, you can review your settings and check for any validation errors.

1. Review the access package's settings.

    ![Screenshot that shows a summary of access package configuration.](./media/entitlement-management-access-package-create/review-create.png)

1. Select **Create** to create the access package.

    The new access package appears in the list of access packages.

1. If the access package is intended to be visible to everyone in scope of the policies, then leave the **Hidden** setting of the access package at **No**. Optionally, if you intend to only allow users with the direct link to request the access package, [edit the access package](entitlement-management-access-package-edit.md#change-the-hidden-setting) to change the **Hidden** setting to **Yes**. Then [copy the link to request the access package](entitlement-management-access-package-settings.md#share-link-to-request-an-access-package) and share it with users who need access.

## Create an access package programmatically

There are two ways to create an access package programmatically: through Microsoft Graph and through the PowerShell cmdlets for Microsoft Graph.

### Create an access package by using Microsoft Graph

You can create an access package by using Microsoft Graph. A user in an appropriate role with an application that has the delegated `EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All` permission can call the API to:

1. [List the resources in the catalog](/graph/api/accesspackagecatalog-list-resources?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http&preserve-view=true) and [create an accessPackageResourceRequest](/graph/api/entitlementmanagement-post-resourcerequests?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http&preserve-view=true) for any resources that aren't yet in the catalog.
1. [Retrieve the roles and scopes of each resource in the catalog](/graph/api/accesspackagecatalog-list-resources?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http#example-2-retrieve-the-roles-and-scopes-of-a-single-resource-in-a-catalog). This list of roles will then be used to select a role, when subsequently creating a resourceRoleScope.
1. [Create an accessPackage](/graph/api/entitlementmanagement-post-accesspackages?view=graph-rest-1.0&preserve-view=true).
1. [Create a resourceRoleScope](/graph/api/accesspackage-post-resourcerolescopes?view=graph-rest-1.0&preserve-view=true) for each resource role needed in the access package.
1. [Create an assignmentPolicy](/graph/api/entitlementmanagement-post-assignmentpolicies?view=graph-rest-1.0&preserve-view=true) for each policy needed in the access package.


### Create an access package by using Microsoft PowerShell

You can also create an access package in PowerShell by using the cmdlets from the [Microsoft Graph PowerShell cmdlets for Identity Governance](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Microsoft.Graph.Identity.Governance/) module.

First, retrieve the ID of the catalog, and of the resource in that catalog and its scopes and roles, that you want to include in the access package. Use a script similar to the following example:

```powershell
Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All"

$catalog = Get-MgEntitlementManagementCatalog -Filter "displayName eq 'Marketing'" -All
if ($catalog -eq $null) { throw "catalog not found" }
$rsc = Get-MgEntitlementManagementCatalogResource -AccessPackageCatalogId $catalog.id -Filter "originSystem eq 'AadApplication'" -ExpandProperty scopes
if ($rsc -eq $null) { throw "resource not found" }
$filt = "(id eq '" + $rsc.Id + "')"
$rrs = Get-MgEntitlementManagementCatalogResourceRole -AccessPackageCatalogId $catalog.id -Filter $filt -ExpandProperty roles,scopes
```

Then, create the access package:

```powershell

$params = @{
    displayName = "sales reps"
    description = "outside sales representatives"
    catalog = @{
        id = $catalog.id
    }
}
$ap = New-MgEntitlementManagementAccessPackage -BodyParameter $params

```

After you create the access package, assign the resource roles to it. For example, if you want to include the first resource role of the resource returned earlier as a resource role of the new access package, you can use a script similar to this one:

```powershell

$rparams = @{
    role = @{
        id =  $rrs.Roles[0].Id
        displayName =  $rrs.Roles[0].DisplayName
        description =  $rrs.Roles[0].Description
        originSystem =  $rrs.Roles[0].OriginSystem
        originId =  $rrs.Roles[0].OriginId
        resource = @{
            id = $rrs.Id
            originId = $rrs.OriginId
            originSystem = $rrs.OriginSystem
        }
    }
    scope = @{
        id = $rsc.Scopes[0].Id
        originId = $rsc.Scopes[0].OriginId
        originSystem = $rsc.Scopes[0].OriginSystem
    }
}

New-MgEntitlementManagementAccessPackageResourceRoleScope -AccessPackageId $ap.Id -BodyParameter $rparams
```

Finally, create the policies. In this policy, only the administrators or access package assignment managers can assign access, and there are no access reviews. For more examples, see [Create an assignment policy through PowerShell](entitlement-management-access-package-request-policy.md#create-an-access-package-assignment-policy-through-powershell) and [Create an assignmentPolicy](/graph/api/entitlementmanagement-post-assignmentpolicies?tabs=http&view=graph-rest-1.0&preserve-view=true).

```powershell


$pparams = @{
    displayName = "New Policy"
    description = "policy for assignment"
    allowedTargetScope = "notSpecified"
    specificAllowedTargets = @(
    )
    expiration = @{
        endDateTime = $null
        duration = $null
        type = "noExpiration"
    }
    requestorSettings = @{
        enableTargetsToSelfAddAccess = $false
        enableTargetsToSelfUpdateAccess = $false
        enableTargetsToSelfRemoveAccess = $false
        allowCustomAssignmentSchedule = $true
        enableOnBehalfRequestorsToAddAccess = $false
        enableOnBehalfRequestorsToUpdateAccess = $false
        enableOnBehalfRequestorsToRemoveAccess = $false
        onBehalfRequestors = @(
        )
    }
    requestApprovalSettings = @{
        isApprovalRequiredForAdd = $false
        isApprovalRequiredForUpdate = $false
        stages = @(
        )
    }
    accessPackage = @{
        id = $ap.Id
    }
}
New-MgEntitlementManagementAssignmentPolicy -BodyParameter $pparams

```

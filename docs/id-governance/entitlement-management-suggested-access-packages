# Suggested access packages in MyAccess (preview)

In MyAccess, Entra ID Governance users can see a curated list of suggested access packages in MyAccess. This capability will allow users to quickly view the most relevant access packages for them based off their peers' access packages and previous requests without scrolling through all their available access packages. 
The suggested access packages list is created by finding people related to the user (manager, direct reports, organization, team members) and recommending access packages based on what the usersâ€™ peers have. The user is also suggested access packages that they previously owned.

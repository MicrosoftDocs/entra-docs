# Common scenarios in entitlement management

There are several ways that you can configure entitlement management for your organization. However, if you're just getting started, it's helpful to understand the common scenarios for administrators, catalog owners, access package managers, approvers, and requestors.

## Programmatic administration

You can also manage access packages, catalogs, policies, requests, and assignments using Microsoft Graph. A user in an appropriate role with an application that has the delegated `EntitlementManagement.Read.All` or `EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All` permission can call the [entitlement management API](/graph/api/resources/entitlementmanagement-overview?view=graph-rest-1.0). For more information, see the [Tutorial: manage access to resources - Microsoft Graph](/graph/tutorial-access-package-api?toc=/azure/active-directory/governance/toc.json&bc=/azure/active-directory/governance/breadcrumb/toc.json). An application with the `EntitlementManagement.Read.All` or `EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All` application permissions can also use many of those API functions, except for managing resources in catalogs and access packages. An application that only needs to operate within specific catalogs can be added to the **Catalog owner** or **Catalog reader** roles of a catalog to be authorized to update or read within that catalog.

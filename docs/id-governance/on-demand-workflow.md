# Run a workflow on-demand

Scheduled workflows by default run every 3 hours, but can also run on-demand so that they can be applied to specific users whenever you see fit. A workflow can be run on demand for any user, and doesn't take into account whether or not a user meets the workflow's execution conditions. Running a workflow on-demand allows you to test workflows before their scheduled run. This testing, on a set of users up to 10 at a time, allows you to see how a workflow will run before it processes a larger set of users. Testing your workflow before their scheduled runs helps you proactively solve potential lifecycle issues more quickly.

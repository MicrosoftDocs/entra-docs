# Delegate approvals in My Access (Preview)

Approval delegation in My Access allows approvers to assign another individual to respond to access package approval requests on their behalf. This feature helps maintain productivity when approvers are unavailable due to leave, travel, or other commitments.

> [!NOTE]
> This feature currently applies only to access package approvals and will be expanded to support access reviews in November 2025.

## How delegation works

When an approver sets a delegate, the following happens:

- All approvals assigned after the delegation are routed to the delegate.
- The original approver can still respond to approvals during the delegation period.
- Delegations, prior to November 1 2025, are time-bound. After November 1, 2025, they can be time-bound or indefinite.
- Delegates are notified when they're assigned.
- Requestors are notified when their request is approved by a delegate.
- Delegation is always bulk; approvers can't delegate specific types of approvals.


### What delegates can see

**Delegates can**:
- View approvals assigned to them.
- See who delegated the approvals.
- Respond to approvals during the specified time period.

**Delegates cannot**:
- Redelegate approvals.
- See approvals assigned before the delegation was set.


## Limitations


- Delegation is limited to one level. If User A delegates to User B, and User B delegates to User C, User C won't receive approvals from User A.
- Delegation isn't restricted. Any user can be selected as a delegate.
- Delegation applies only to approvals assigned after the delegation is configured.

# Sensitivity Labels in Lifecycle Workflows

Maintaining and classifying secure data within your environment is an important part in maintaining a secure environment. Sensitivity labels from Microsoft Purview Information Protection let you classify and protect your organization's data, while making sure that user productivity and their ability to collaborate isn't hindered. With sensitivity labels in Lifecycle Workflows, administrators are able to quickly view the sensitivity labels of groups during creation, and editing, of workflow tasks.

# Assign Microsoft Entra roles in Privileged Identity Management

With Microsoft Entra ID, a Global administrator can make **permanent** Microsoft Entra admin role assignments. These role assignments can be created using the [Microsoft Entra admin center](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md) or using [PowerShell commands](/powershell/module/azuread/#directory_roles).

The Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management (PIM) service also allows Privileged role administrators to make permanent admin role assignments. Additionally, Privileged role administrators can make users **eligible** for Microsoft Entra admin roles. An eligible administrator can activate the role when they need it, and then their permissions expire once they're done.

Privileged Identity Management support both built-in and custom Microsoft Entra roles. For more information on Microsoft Entra custom roles, see [Role-based access control in Microsoft Entra ID](~/identity/role-based-access-control/custom-overview.md).

>[!Note]
>When a role is assigned, the assignment:
>- Can't be assigned for a duration of less than five minutes
>- Can't be removed within five minutes of it being assigned

## Assign a role

Follow these steps to make a user eligible for a Microsoft Entra admin role.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Privileged Role Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#privileged-role-administrator).

1. Browse to **Identity governance** > **Privileged Identity Management** > **Microsoft Entra roles**.

1. Select **Roles** to see the list of roles for Microsoft Entra permissions.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/pim-how-to-add-role-to-user/roles-list.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Roles page with the Add assignments action selected.":::

1. Select **Add assignments** to open the **Add assignments** page.

1. Select **Select a role** to open the **Select a role** page.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/pim-how-to-add-role-to-user/select-role.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the new assignment pane.":::

1. Select a role you want to assign, select a member to whom you want to assign to the role, and then select **Next**.

    [!INCLUDE [rbac-assign-roles-guest-user-note](../../includes/rbac-assign-roles-guest-user-note.md)]

1. In the **Assignment type** list on the **Membership settings** pane, select **Eligible** or **Active**.

    - **Eligible** assignments require the member of the role to perform an action to use the role. Actions might include performing a multifactor authentication (MFA) check, providing a business justification, or requesting approval from designated approvers.

    - **Active** assignments don't require the member to perform any action to use the role. Members assigned as active have the privileges assigned to the role at all times.

1. To specify a specific assignment duration, add a start and end date and time boxes. When finished, select **Assign** to create the new role assignment.

    - **Permanent** assignments have no expiration date. Use this option for permanent workers who frequently need the role permissions.

    - **Time-bound** assignments will expire at the end of a specified period. Use this option with temporary or contract workers, for example, whose project end date and time are known.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/pim-how-to-add-role-to-user/start-and-end-dates.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Memberships settings - date and time.":::

1. After the role is assigned, an assignment status notification is displayed.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/pim-how-to-add-role-to-user/assignment-notification.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing a new assignment notification.":::

## Assign a role with restricted scope

For certain roles, the scope of the granted permissions can be restricted to a single admin unit, service principal, or application. This procedure is an example if assigning a role that has the scope of an administrative unit. For a list of roles that support scope via administrative unit, see [Assign scoped roles to an administrative unit](~/identity/role-based-access-control/admin-units-assign-roles.md). This feature is currently being rolled out to Microsoft Entra organizations.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Privileged Role Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#privileged-role-administrator).

1. Browse to **Identity** > **Roles & admins** > **Roles & admins**.

1. Select the **User Administrator**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/pim-how-to-add-role-to-user/add-assignment.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Add assignment command is available when you open a role in the portal.":::

1. â€‹Select **Add assignments**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/pim-how-to-add-role-to-user/add-scope.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing when a role supports scope, you can select a scope.":::

1. On the **Add assignments** page, you can:

   - Select a user or group to be assigned to the role
   - Select the role scope (in this case, administrative units)
   - Select an administrative unit for the scope

For more information about creating administrative units, see [Add and remove administrative units](~/identity/role-based-access-control/admin-units-manage.md).

## Assign a role using Microsoft Graph API

For more information about Microsoft Graph APIs for PIM, see [Overview of role management through the privileged identity management (PIM) API](/graph/api/resources/privilegedidentitymanagementv3-overview).

For permissions required to use the PIM API, see [Understand the Privileged Identity Management APIs](pim-apis.md).

  Activate a Microsoft Entra role in PIM
introduction: |
  Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management (PIM) simplifies how enterprises manage privileged access to resources in Microsoft Entra ID and other Microsoft online services like Microsoft 365 or Microsoft Intune.  

  If you have been made *eligible* for an administrative role, then you must *activate* the role assignment when you need to perform privileged actions. For example, if you occasionally manage Microsoft 365 features, your organization's Privileged Role Administrators might not make you a permanent Global Administrator, since that role impacts other services, too. Instead, they would make you eligible for Microsoft Entra roles such as Exchange Online Administrator. You can request to activate that role when you need its privileges, and then have administrator control for a predetermined time period.

  This article is for administrators who need to activate their Microsoft Entra role in Privileged Identity Management. Although any user can submit a request for the role they need through PIM without having the Privileged Role Administrator (PRA) role, this role is required for managing and assigning roles to others within the organization.

  >[!IMPORTANT]
  >When a role is activated, Microsoft Entra PIM temporarily adds active assignment for the role. Microsoft Entra PIM creates active assignment (assigns user to a role) within seconds. When deactivation (manual or through activation time expiration) happens, Microsoft Entra PIM removes the active assignment within seconds as well.
  >
  >Application may provide access based on the role the user has. In some situations, application access may not immediately reflect the fact that user got role assigned or removed. If application previously cached the fact that user does not have a role – when user tries to access application again, access may not be provided. Similarly, if application previously cached the fact that user has a role – when role is deactivated, user may still get access. Specific situation depends on the application’s architecture. For some applications, signing out and signing back in may help get access added or removed.

      Activate a role
    summary: |
      When you need to assume a Microsoft Entra role, you can request activation by opening **My roles** in Privileged Identity Management.

      >[!NOTE]
      > PIM is now available in the Azure mobile app (iOS | Android) for Microsoft Entra ID and Azure resource roles. Easily activate eligible assignments, request renewals for ones that are expiring, or check the status of pending requests. [Read more below](#activate-pim-roles-using-the-azure-mobile-app)
    steps:
      - |
        Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Privileged Role Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#privileged-role-administrator).
      - |
        Browse to **Identity governance** > **Privileged Identity Management** > **My roles**.  For information about how to add the Privileged Identity Management tile to your dashboard, see [Start using Privileged Identity Management](pim-getting-started.md).
      - |
        Select **Microsoft Entra roles** to see a list of your eligible Microsoft Entra roles.

        ![My roles page showing roles you can activate](./media/pim-how-to-activate-role/my-roles.png)
      - |
        In the **Microsoft Entra roles** list, find the role you want to activate.

        ![Microsoft Entra roles - My eligible roles list](./media/pim-how-to-activate-role/activate-link.png)
      - |
        Select **Activate** to open the Activate pane.

        ![Microsoft Entra roles - activation page contains duration and scope](./media/pim-how-to-activate-role/activate-page.png)
      - |
        Select **Additional verification required** and follow the instructions to provide security verification. You are required to authenticate only once per session.

        ![Screen to provide security verification such as a PIN code](./media/pim-resource-roles-activate-your-roles/resources-mfa-enter-code.png)
      - |
        After multifactor authentication, select **Activate before proceeding**.

        ![Verify my identity with MFA before role activates](./media/pim-how-to-activate-role/activate-role-mfa-banner.png)
      - |
        If you want to specify a reduced scope, select **Scope** to open the filter pane. On the filter pane, you can specify the Microsoft Entra resources that you need access to. It's a best practice to request access to the fewest resources that you need.
      - |
        If necessary, specify a custom activation start time. The Microsoft Entra role would be activated after the selected time.
      - |
        In the **Reason** box, enter the reason for the activation request.
      - |
        Select **Activate**.

        If the [role requires approval](pim-resource-roles-approval-workflow.md) to activate, a notification appears in the upper right corner of your browser informing you the request is pending approval.

        ## Activate a role using Microsoft Graph API

        For more information about Microsoft Graph APIs for PIM, see [Overview of role management through the privileged identity management (PIM) API](/graph/api/resources/privilegedidentitymanagementv3-overview).

        ### Get all eligible roles that you can activate

        When a user gets their role eligibility via group membership, this Microsoft Graph request doesn't return their eligibility.

        #### HTTP response

        To save space we're showing only the response for one role, but all eligible role assignments that you can activate will be listed.

      ## Activate PIM roles using the Azure mobile app

      PIM is now available in the Microsoft Entra ID and Azure resource roles mobile apps in both iOS and Android.
    steps:
      - |
        To activate an eligible Microsoft Entra role assignment, start by downloading the Azure mobile app ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-azure/id1219013620) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.azure)). You can also download the app by selecting ‘Open in mobile’  from Privileged Identity Management > My roles > Microsoft Entra roles.

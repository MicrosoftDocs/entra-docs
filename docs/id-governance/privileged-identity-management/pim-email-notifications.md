# Email notifications in PIM

Privileged Identity Management (PIM) lets you know when important events occur in your Microsoft Entra organization, such as when a role is assigned or activated. Privileged Identity Management keeps you informed by sending you and other participants email notifications. These emails might also include links to relevant tasks, such activating or renewing a role. This article describes what these emails look like, when they are sent, and who receives them.

>[!NOTE]
>One event in Privileged Identity Management can generate email notifications to multiple recipients – assignees, approvers, or administrators. The maximum number of notifications sent per one event is 1000. If the number of recipients exceeds 1000 – only the first 1000 recipients will receive an email notification. This does not prevent other assignees, administrators, or approvers from using their permissions in Microsoft Entra ID and Privileged Identity Management.

## Sender email address and subject line

Emails sent from Privileged Identity Management for both Microsoft Entra ID and Azure resource roles have the following sender email address:

- Email address:  **azure-noreply\@microsoft.com**
- Display name: Microsoft Azure

These emails include a **PIM** prefix in the subject line. Here's an example:

- PIM: Alain Charon was permanently assigned the Backup Reader role

## Email timing for activation approvals

When users activate their role and the role setting requires approval, approvers receive two emails for each approval:

- Request to approve or deny the user's activation request (sent by the request approval engine)
- The user's request is approved (sent by the request approval engine)

Also, Global Administrators and Privileged Role Administrators receive an email for each approval:

- The user's role is activated (sent by Privileged Identity Management)

The first two emails sent by the request approval engine can be delayed. Currently, 90% of emails take three to ten minutes, but for 1% customers it can be longer, up to fifteen minutes.

If an approval request is approved in the Azure portal before the first email is sent, the first email will no longer be triggered and other approvers won't be notified by email of the approval request. It might appear as if they didn't get an email but it's the expected behavior.

## Notifications for Microsoft Entra roles

Privileged Identity Management sends emails when the following events occur for Microsoft Entra roles:

- When a privileged role activation is pending approval
- When a privileged role activation request is completed
- When Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management is enabled

Who receives these emails for Microsoft Entra roles depends on your role, the event, and the notifications setting.

| User | Role activation is pending approval | Role activation request is completed | PIM is enabled |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Privileged Role Administrator</br>(Activated) | Yes</br>(only if no explicit approvers are specified) | Yes* | Yes |
| Security Administrator</br>(Activated) | No | Yes* | Yes |
| Global Administrator</br>(Activated) | No | Yes* | Yes |

\* If the [**Notifications** setting](pim-how-to-change-default-settings.md) is set to **Enable**.

The following shows an example email that is sent when a user activates a Microsoft Entra role for the fictional Contoso organization.

### Weekly Privileged Identity Management digest email for Microsoft Entra roles

A weekly Privileged Identity Management summary email for Microsoft Entra roles is sent to Privileged Role Administrators, Security Administrators, and Global Administrators that have enabled Privileged Identity Management. This weekly email provides a snapshot of Privileged Identity Management activities for the week as well as privileged role assignments. It is only available for Microsoft Entra organizations on the public cloud. Here's an example email:

:::image type="content" source="./media/pim-email-notifications/email-directory-weekly.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the weekly Privileged Identity Management digest email for Microsoft Entra roles.":::

The email includes:

| Tile | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Users activated** | Number of times users activated their eligible role inside the organization. |
| **Users made permanent** | Number of times users with an eligible assignment is made permanent. |
| **Role assignments in Privileged Identity Management** | Number of times users are assigned an eligible role inside Privileged Identity Management. |
| **Role assignments outside of PIM** | Number of times users are assigned a permanent role outside of Privileged Identity Management (inside Microsoft Entra ID). This alert and the accompanying email can be enabled or disabled by opening the alert settings. |

The **Overview of your top roles** section lists the top five roles in your organization based on total number of permanent and eligible administrators for each role. The **Take action** link opens [Discovery & Insights](pim-security-wizard.md) where you can convert permanent administrators to eligible administrators in batches.

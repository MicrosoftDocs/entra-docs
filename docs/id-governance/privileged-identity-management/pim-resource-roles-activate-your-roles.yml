  Activate my Azure resource roles in Privileged Identity Management
introduction: |
  Use Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management (PIM), to allow eligible role members for Azure resources to schedule activation for a future date and time. They can also select a specific activation duration within the maximum (configured by administrators).

  This article is for members who need to activate their Azure resource role in Privileged Identity Management.

  >[!IMPORTANT]
  >When a role is activated, Microsoft Entra PIM temporarily adds active assignment for the role. Microsoft Entra PIM creates active assignment (assigns user to a role) within seconds. When deactivation (manual or through activation time expiration) happens, Microsoft Entra PIM removes the active assignment within seconds as well.
  >
  >Application may provide access based on the role the user has. In some situations, application access may not immediately reflect the fact that user got role assigned or removed. If application previously cached the fact that user does not have a role – when user tries to access application again, access may not be provided. Similarly, if application previously cached the fact that user has a role – when role is deactivated, user may still get access. Specific situation depends on the application’s architecture. For some applications, signing out and signing back in may help get access added or removed.

      Activate a role
    summary: |
      When you need to take on an Azure resource role, you can request activation by using the **My roles** navigation option in Privileged Identity Management.

      >[!NOTE]
      > PIM is now available in the Azure mobile app (iOS | Android) for Microsoft Entra ID and Azure resource roles. Easily activate eligible assignments, request renewals for ones that are expiring, or check the status of pending requests. [Read more below](#activate-pim-roles-using-the-azure-mobile-app)

    steps:
      - |
        Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com).

      - |
        Browse to **Identity Governance** > **Privileged Identity Management** > **My roles**.

          [ ![Screenshot of my roles page showing roles you can activate.](./media/pim-resource-roles-activate-your-roles/resources-my-roles.png) ](./media/pim-resource-roles-activate-your-roles/resources-my-roles.png#lightbox)
      - |
        Select **Azure resources** to see a list of your eligible Azure resource roles.

          ![Screenshot of my roles - Azure resource roles page.](./media/pim-resource-roles-activate-your-roles/resources-my-roles-azure-resources.png)
      - |
        In the **Azure resource roles** list, find the role you want to activate.

          [ ![Screenshot of azure resource roles - My eligible roles list.](./media/pim-resource-roles-activate-your-roles/resources-my-roles-activate.png) ](./media/pim-resource-roles-activate-your-roles/resources-my-roles-activate.png#lightbox)
      - |
        Select **Activate** to open the Activate page.

          ![Screenshot of the opened Activate pane with scope, start time, duration, and reason.](./media/pim-resource-roles-activate-your-roles/azure-role-eligible-activate.png)
      - |
        If your role requires multifactor authentication, select **Verify your identity before proceeding**. You only have to authenticate once per session.
      - |
        Select **Verify my identity** and follow the instructions to provide additional security verification.

          ![Screenshot of screen to provide security verification such as a PIN code.](./media/pim-resource-roles-activate-your-roles/resources-mfa-enter-code.png)
      - |
         It's a best practice to only request access to the resources you need. If you want to specify a reduced scope, select the **Scope tab**.

          1. Go to the **Scope** tab to reduce the scope of activation.
          2. Click **Select scope** to select the scope.
          
          :::image type="content" source="./media/pim-resource-roles-activate-your-roles/activate-billing-reader-select-scope.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Scope tab in the Activate - Billing Reader pane, showing the 'Select scope' button and a management group listed under Selected resources. This helps users identify where to click to begin scoping their activation request.":::

          3. Use the dropdown provided to scope the search to a specific resource.
          4. The reduced scoped resources are shown in **Selected resources** before activation and should be selected from the grid provided. The dropdown selection does not define the reduced scope.

          :::image type="content" source="./media/pim-resource-roles-activate-your-roles/active-billing-reader-set-scope.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the process of setting the scope for activation, with a management group selected in the grid. This image demonstrates how to confirm the correct resource is selected before proceeding with activation.":::

          >[!NOTE]
          >If your eligibility is at the management group level, the dropdown will show all direct child resources (management group and subscription). You can select either a management group or subscription from the grid shown, or further scope down the search by selecting the appropriate management group or subscription.

          ![Screenshot of activate - Resource filter pane to specify scope.](./media/pim-resource-roles-activate-your-roles/resources-my-roles-resource-filter.png)
      - |
        If necessary, specify a custom activation start time. The member would be activated after the selected time.
      - |
        In the **Reason** box, enter the reason for the activation request.
      - |
        Select **Activate**.

          >[!NOTE]
          >If the [role requires approval](pim-resource-roles-approval-workflow.md) to activate, a notification will appear in the upper right corner of your browser informing you the request is pending approval.

      Activate a role with Azure Resource Manager API
    summary: |
      Privileged Identity Management supports Azure Resource Manager API commands to manage Azure resource roles, as documented in the [PIM ARM API reference](/rest/api/authorization/role-eligibility-schedule-requests). For the permissions required to use the PIM API, see [Understand the Privileged Identity Management APIs](pim-apis.md).

      To activate an eligible Azure role assignment and gain activated access, use the [Role Assignment Schedule Requests - Create REST API](/rest/api/authorization/role-assignment-schedule-requests/create?tabs=HTTP) to create a new request and specify the security principal, role definition, requestType = SelfActivate and scope. To call this API, you must have an eligible role assignment on the scope. 

      Use a GUID tool to generate a unique identifier for the role assignment identifier. The identifier has the format: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000. 

      Replace {roleAssignmentScheduleRequestName} in the PUT request with the GUID identifier of the role assignment. 

      For more information about eligible roles for Azure resources management, see [PIM ARM API tutorial](/rest/api/authorization/privileged-role-assignment-rest-sample?source=docs#activate-an-eligible-role-assignment). 

      This is a sample HTTP request to activate an eligible assignment for an Azure role.

      Deactivate a role assignment
    summary: |
      When a role assignment is activated, you see a **Deactivate** option in the PIM portal for the role assignment. Also, you can't deactivate a role assignment within five minutes after activation.

      ## Activate with Azure portal

      Privileged Identity Management role activation is integrated into the Billing and Access Control (AD) extensions within the Azure portal. Shortcuts to Subscriptions (billing) and Access Control (AD) allow you to activate PIM roles directly from these blades.

      From the Subscriptions blade, select “View eligible subscriptions” in the horizontal command menu to check your eligible, active, and expired assignments. From there, you can activate an eligible assignment in the same pane.

        ![Screenshot of view eligible subscriptions on the Subscriptions page.](./media/pim-resource-roles-activate-your-roles/view-subscriptions-1.png)

        ![Screenshot of view eligible subscriptions on the Cost Management: Integration Service page.](./media/pim-resource-roles-activate-your-roles/view-subscriptions-2.png)

      In Access control (IAM) for a resource, you can now select “View my access” to see your currently active and eligible role assignments and activate directly.

        ![Screenshot of current role assignments on the Measurement page.](./media/pim-resource-roles-activate-your-roles/view-my-access.png)

      By integrating PIM capabilities into different Azure portal blades, this new feature allows you to gain temporary access to view or edit subscriptions and resources more easily.

      ## Activate PIM roles using the Azure mobile app

      PIM is now available in the Microsoft Entra ID and Azure resource roles mobile apps in both iOS and Android.

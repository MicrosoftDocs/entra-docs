# Services and integration partners

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Entra ID Governance service and integration partners](../includes/services-and-integration-partners-governance.md)]

## Services and integration partners for deploying Microsoft Entra with SAP applications

Partners can also help your organization with planning and deployment for Microsoft Entra with SAP applications such as SAP S/4HANA. For more information, see the list of services and integration partners for deploying Microsoft Entra with SAP applications in the guide to [migrate identity management scenarios from SAP IDM to Microsoft Entra](~/identity/app-provisioning/migrate-from-sap-idm.md#services-and-integration-partners-for-deploying-microsoft-entra-with-sap-applications).

## Partner-driven application integrations

Microsoft Entra ID Governance allows you to balance your organization's need for security and employee productivity with the right processes and visibility, across hundreds of [Microsoft Entra ID Governance integrations with applications](apps.md). These application integrations are used to automate identity lifecycle management, through protocols such as System for Cross domain Identity Management (SCIM). Using applications that support SCIM simplify implementing governance controls across your organization, as Microsoft Entra can send changes to the applications for user and group provisioning, update, and deprovisioning.

In cases where an application doesn't support SCIM, partners have gateways between Microsoft Entra outbound provisioning and those applications. For a list of applications integrated through a partner offering, see [partner-driven integrations](~/identity/app-provisioning/partner-driven-integrations.md).

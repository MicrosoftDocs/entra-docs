# Microsoft Entra ID Governance service limits

This article contains the default usage constraints for the Microsoft Entra ID Governance, part of Microsoft Entra, service. If youâ€™re looking for the full set of non-governance specific Microsoft Entra service limits, see: [Microsoft Entra service limits and restrictions](../identity/users/directory-service-limits-restrictions.md).

## Entitlement Management

> [!Tip]
> We recommend that access packages contain more than one resource role and are modeled on the basis of departments, job functions, locations, projects or a combination of these.

# Workflow Insights (preview)

Workflows created using Lifecycle Workflows allow for the automation of lifecycle task for users no matter where they fall in the Joiner-Mover-Leaver (JML) model of their identity lifecycle in your organization. Making sure workflows are processed correctly is an important part of an organization's lifecycle management process. With Lifecycle workflow's Workflow Insights feature, you're able to see aggregate information about all workflows across your tenant.

With Workflow Insights, you're also able to view aggregate workflow information across your tenant. Workflow Insights allows you to quickly view the following information:

- Summary
- Top Workflows
- Top Tasks
- Workflow by Category

More details about insights found in these sections are discussed in the following sections of this article. For a step by step guide on checking the insights for workflows in your tenant, see: [Check Workflow Insights (preview)](manage-workflow-insights.md).


## Workflow Insights summary

The Workflow Insights summary provides a numerical view of successful workflows, users, and tasks processed within a tenant.

## Top Workflow Insights summary

The Top Workflows Insights summary lists the top workflows ran in the tenant for a time-span that can be 7, 14, or 30 days. The top workflows can also filter in order by total processed, successful runs, or failed runs.

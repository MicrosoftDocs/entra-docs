# Execute employee termination tasks by using lifecycle workflows

This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide on how to execute a real-time employee termination by using lifecycle workflows in the Microsoft Entra admin center.

This *leaver* scenario runs a workflow on demand and accomplishes the following tasks:

- Remove the user from all groups.
- Remove the user from all Microsoft Teams memberships.
- Delete the user account.

For more information, see [Run a workflow on demand](on-demand-workflow.md).

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Entra ID Governance license](../includes/entra-entra-governance-license.md)]


## Before you begin

To complete this tutorial, you must satisfy the prerequisites listed in this section before starting the tutorial as they aren't included in the actual tutorial. As part of the prerequisites for completing this tutorial, you need an account that has group and Teams memberships and that can be deleted during the tutorial. For comprehensive instructions on how to complete these prerequisite steps, see [Prepare user accounts for lifecycle workflows](tutorial-prepare-user-accounts.md).

The leaver scenario includes the following steps:

1. Prerequisite: Create a user account that represents an employee leaving your organization.
1. Prerequisite: Prepare the user account with group and Teams memberships.
1. Create the lifecycle management workflow.
1. Run the workflow on demand.
1. Verify that the workflow was successfully executed.

## Create a workflow by using the leaver template

Use the following steps to create a leaver on-demand workflow that executes a real-time employee termination by using lifecycle workflows in the Microsoft Entra admin center:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Lifecycle Workflows Administrator](../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#lifecycle-workflows-administrator).
2. Select **Identity Governance**.
3. Select **Lifecycle workflows**.
4. On the **Overview** tab, select **New workflow**.

5. From the collection of templates, choose **Select** under **Real-time employee termination**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-lifecycle-workflows/select-template.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting a workflow template for real-time employee termination." lightbox="media/tutorial-lifecycle-workflows/select-template.png":::

6. Configure basic information about the workflow, and then select **Next: Review tasks**.

7. Inspect the tasks if you want, but no additional configuration is needed. Select **Next: Select users** when you're finished.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-lifecycle-workflows/real-time-tasks.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the tab for reviewing template tasks." lightbox="media/tutorial-lifecycle-workflows/real-time-tasks.png":::

8. On the **Select users** page, for **Selection type** choose **Select users to run now**. It allows you to select users for which the workflow will be executed immediately after creation. Regardless of the selection, you can run the workflow on demand later at any time, as needed.

9. Select **Add users** to designate the users for this workflow.

10. A panel with the list of available users appears on the right side of the window. Choose **Select** when you're done with your selection.

11. Select **Next: Review and create** when you're satisfied with your selection of users.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-lifecycle-workflows/real-time-review-users.png" alt-text="Screenshot of added users." lightbox="media/tutorial-lifecycle-workflows/real-time-review-users.png":::

12. Verify that the information is correct, and then select **Create**.

## Run the workflow

After the workflow is created, it runs automatically every three hours. Lifecycle workflows check every three hours for users in the associated execution condition, and executes the configured tasks for those users.

To run the workflow immediately, you can use the on-demand feature.

> [!NOTE]
> You currently can't run a workflow on demand if it's set to **Disabled**. You need to set the workflow to **Enabled** to use the on-demand feature.

To run a workflow on demand for users by using the Microsoft Entra admin center:

1. On the workflow screen, select the specific workflow that you want to run.
2. Select **Run on demand**.
3. On the **Select users** tab, select **Add users**.
4. Add users.
5. Select **Run workflow**.

## Check tasks and workflow status

At any time, you can monitor the status of workflows and tasks. Three data pivots, users runs, and tasks are currently available. You can learn more in the how-to guide [Check the status of a workflow](check-status-workflow.md). In this tutorial, you check the status by using the user-focused reports.

1. On the **Overview** page for the workflow, select **Workflow history**.  

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-lifecycle-workflows/workflow-history-real-time.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the overview page for a workflow." lightbox="media/tutorial-lifecycle-workflows/workflow-history-real-time.png":::

   The **Workflow history** page appears.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-lifecycle-workflows/user-summary-real-time.png" alt-text="Screenshot of real-time workflow history." lightbox="media/tutorial-lifecycle-workflows/user-summary-real-time.png":::

1. Select **Total tasks** for a user to view the total number of tasks created and their statuses.

1. To add an extra layer of granularity, select **Failed tasks** for a user to view the total number of failed tasks assigned to that user.

1. Select **Unprocessed tasks** for a user to view the total number of unprocessed or canceled tasks assigned to that user.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-lifecycle-workflows/canceled-tasks-real-time.png" alt-text="Screenshot of unprocessed tasks for a real-time workflow." lightbox="media/tutorial-lifecycle-workflows/canceled-tasks-real-time.png":::

# Microsoft Entra ID Governance licensing fundamentals
This following document discusses Microsoft Entra ID Governance licensing. It's intended for IT decision makers, IT administrators, and IT professionals who are considering Microsoft Entra ID Governance services for their organizations. 

## Types of licenses

The following licenses are available for use with Microsoft Entra ID Governance in the commercial and government clouds. The choice of licenses you need in a tenant depends on the features you're using in that tenant.

- **Free** - Included with Microsoft cloud subscriptions such as Microsoft Azure, Microsoft 365, and others.
- **Microsoft Entra ID P1** - Microsoft Entra ID P1 is available as a standalone product or included with Microsoft 365 E3 for enterprise customers and Microsoft 365 Business Premium for small to medium businesses. 
- **Microsoft Entra ID P2** - Microsoft Entra ID P2 is available as a standalone product or included with Microsoft 365 E5 for enterprise customers.
- **Microsoft Entra ID Governance** - Microsoft Entra ID Governance is an advanced set of identity governance capabilities available for Microsoft Entra ID P1 and P2 customers. Microsoft Entra ID Governance is available as five products **Microsoft Entra ID Governance**, **Microsoft Entra ID Governance Step Up for Microsoft Entra ID P2**, **Microsoft Entra ID Governance Step up for Microsoft Entra ID F2**, **Microsoft Entra ID Governance for Government** and **Microsoft Entra ID Governance Add-on for Microsoft Entra ID P2 for Government**. These five products differ only in their prerequisites; they contain both the entitlement management, privileged identity management and access reviews capabilities that were in Microsoft Entra ID P2, and additional advanced identity governance capabilities.

>[!NOTE]
>Some Microsoft Entra ID Governance scenarios can be configured to depend upon other features that aren't covered by Microsoft Entra ID Governance.  These features might have additional licensing requirements.  See the [Identity Governance overview](identity-governance-overview.md) for more information on governance scenarios that rely on additional features.

The Microsoft Entra ID Governance for Government and Microsoft Entra ID Governance Add-on for Microsoft Entra ID P2 for Government products are available in the US Government community cloud (GCC), GCC-High, and Department of Defense cloud environments.

### Governance products and prerequisites

The Microsoft Entra ID Governance capabilities are currently available in five products. These five products provide the same identity governance capabilities. The difference between the five products is that they have different prerequisites.

- A subscription to **Microsoft Entra ID Governance** or **MIcrosoft Entra ID Governance for Government**, listed in the product terms as the **Microsoft Entra ID Governance (User SL)** license, requires that the tenant also have an active subscription to another product, one that contains the `AAD_PREMIUM` or `AAD_PREMIUM_P2` service plan. Examples of products meeting this prerequisite include **Microsoft Entra ID P1**, **Microsoft 365 E3/E5/A3/A5/G3/G5**, **Enterprise Mobility + Security E3/E5** or **Microsoft 365 F1/F3**.
- A subscription to **Microsoft Entra ID Governance Step Up for Microsoft Entra ID P2** or **Microsoft Entra ID Governance Add-on for Microsoft Entra ID P2 for Government**, listed in the product terms as the **Microsoft Entra ID Governance P2** license, requires that the tenant also have an active subscription to another product, one that contains the `AAD_PREMIUM_P2` service plan. Examples of products meeting this prerequisite include **Microsoft Entra ID P2**, **Microsoft 365 E5/A5/G5**, **Enterprise Mobility + Security E5**, **Microsoft 365 E5/F5 Security** or **Microsoft 365 F5 Security + Compliance**.
- A subscription to **Microsoft Entra ID Governance Step up for Microsoft Entra ID F2**, listed in the product terms as the **Microsoft Entra ID Governance F2** license, requires that the tenant also have an active subscription to another product, one that contains the `AAD_PREMIUM_P2` service plan. Examples of products meeting this prerequisite include **Microsoft Entra ID F2**.

The [product names and service plan identifiers for licensing](../identity/users/licensing-service-plan-reference.md) lists additional products that include the prerequisite service plans.

>[!NOTE]
>A subscription to a prerequisite for a Microsoft Entra ID Governance product must be active in the tenant. If a prerequisite is not present, or the subscription expires, then Microsoft Entra ID Governance scenarios might not function as expected.  

To check if the prerequisite products for a Microsoft Entra ID Governance product are present in a tenant, you can use the Microsoft Entra admin center or the Microsoft 365 admin center to view the list of products.

1. Sign into the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as a [License Administrator](../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#license-administrator).

1. In the **Identity** menu, expand **Billing** and select **Licenses**.

1. In the **Manage** menu, select **Licensed features**.  The information bar indicates the current Microsoft Entra ID license plan.

1. To view the existing products in the tenant, in the **Manage** menu, select **All products**.

## Starting a trial

A Global Administrator in a commercial tenant that has an appropriate prerequisite product, such as Microsoft Entra ID P1, already purchased, and isn't already using or has previously trialed Microsoft Entra ID Governance, can request a trial of Microsoft Entra ID Governance in their tenant.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal/Home) as a [Global Administrator](../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#global-administrator)

1. In the **Billing** menu, select **Purchase services**.

1. In the **Search all product categories** box, type `"Microsoft Entra ID Governance"`.

1. Select **Details** below **Microsoft Entra ID Governance** to view the trial and purchase information for the product.  If your tenant has Microsoft Entra ID P2, then select  **Details** below **Microsoft Entra ID Governance Step-Up for Microsoft Entra ID P2**.

1. In the product details page, select **Start free trial**.

## Licensing FAQs

### Do licenses need to be assigned to users to use Identity Governance features?

Users don't need to be assigned a Microsoft Entra ID Governance license, but there needs to be as many license seats to include all users in scope of, or who configures, the Identity Governance features.

### How can I license usage of Microsoft Entra ID Governance features for business guests?

All users who are in scope of Microsoft Entra ID Governance features, including business guests such as contractors, partners, and external collaborators, need a license.  We're creating a new Microsoft Entra ID Governance license for business guests. This license operates on a monthly active usage (MAU) model. Customers are able to acquire licenses matching their anticipated business guest MAU.

We anticipate making these licenses available in late 2024. In the interim, organizations that govern the identities of their employees with Microsoft Entra ID Governance can govern the identities of their business guests for no additional cost. At this time, existing customers of Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 with Microsoft Entra External ID can continue using the subset of features that are included in P1 or P2 with their business guests through their Microsoft Entra External ID license.

For more information, see: [Microsoft Entra ID Governance licensing for business guests](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/microsoft-entra-id-governance-licensing-for-business-guests/ba-p/3575579).

### What happens to PIM when a license expires?

If a Microsoft Entra ID P2 or Microsoft Entra ID Governance license expires or trial ends, Privileged Identity Management features will no longer be available in your directory. The changes discussed below are applicable to PIM for Microsoft Entra roles, PIM for Azure resources, and PIM for Groups.

- Active permanent assignments aren't affected.
- Active time-bound assignments become active permanent, which means they'll no longer expire at a designated time.
- Eligible role assignments are removed, as users will no longer be able to activate privileged roles.
- Privileged Identity Management blades on Microsoft Entra admin center or Azure portal, API, and PowerShell interfaces of Privileged Identity Management, will no longer be available for users to activate roles, manage assignments, or perform access reviews of privileged roles.
- Any ongoing access reviews of Microsoft Entra roles end, and Privileged Identity Management configuration settings are removed.
- Privileged Identity Management will no longer send emails on role assignment changes and PIM Alerts.

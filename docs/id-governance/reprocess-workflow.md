# Reprocess workflow runs using Lifecycle Workflows



Lifecycle workflows allows you to automate tasks for users no matter where they fall in the Joiner-Mover-Leaver (JML) model within your organization. By reprocessing workflows, you are able to run workflows again for users they have already run for. This allows you to quickly make changes to where the workflow could have failed for users who were already processed by the workflow.

  - For Next step, provide one link to the next step in a sequence. Use the blue box format
  - For Related content provide 1-3 links. Include some context so the customer can determine why they would click the link. Add a context sentence for the following links.

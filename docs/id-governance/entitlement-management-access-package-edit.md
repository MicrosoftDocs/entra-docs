# Hide or delete an access package in entitlement management

When you create access packages, they're discoverable by default. This means that if a policy allows a user to request the access package, they'll automatically see the access package listed in their My Access portal. However, you can change the **Hidden** setting so that the access package isn't listed in the user's My Access portal.

This article describes how to hide or delete an access package.

## Change the Hidden setting

Follow these steps to change the **Hidden** setting for an access package.

**Prerequisite role:** Global Administrator, Identity Governance Administrator, Catalog owner, or Access package manager

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least an [Identity Governance Administrator](../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#identity-governance-administrator).

1. Browse to **Identity governance** > **Entitlement management** > **Access package**.

1. On the **Access packages** page open an access package.

1. On the Overview page, select **Edit**.

1. Set the **Hidden** setting.

    If set to **No**, the access package will be listed in the user's My Access portal.

    If set to **Yes**, the access package won't be listed in the user's My Access portal. The only way a user can view the access package is if they have the direct **My Access portal link** to the access package. For more information, see [Share link to request an access package](entitlement-management-access-package-settings.md).

## Delete an access package

# Lifecycle Workflow built-in tasks

Lifecycle Workflows come with many pre-configured tasks that are designed to automate common lifecycle management scenarios. These built-in tasks can be utilized to make customized workflows to suit your organization's needs. These tasks can be configured within seconds to create new workflows. These tasks also have categories based on the Joiner-Mover-Leaver model so that they can be easily placed into workflows based on need. In this article you get the complete list of tasks, information on common parameters each task has, and a list of unique parameters needed for each specific task.


## Supported tasks
 
Lifecycle Workflow's built-in tasks each include an identifier, known as **taskDefinitionID**, and can be used to create either new workflows from scratch, or inserted into workflow templates so that they fit the needs of your organization. For more information on templates available for use with Lifecycle Workflows, see: [Lifecycle Workflow Templates](lifecycle-workflow-templates.md).


[!INCLUDE [Lifecylce Workflows tasks table](../includes/lifecycle-workflows-tasks-table.md)]

## Common task parameters

Common task parameters are the non-unique parameters contained in every task. When adding tasks to a new workflow, or a workflow template, you can customize and configure these parameters so that they match your requirements.

|Parameter  |Definition  |
|---------|---------|
|category     |  A  read-only string that identifies the category or categories of the task. Automatically determined when the taskDefinitionID is chosen.     |
|taskDefinitionId     | A string referencing a taskDefinition that determines which task to run.       |
|isEnabled     | A boolean value that denotes whether the task is set to run or not. If set to “true" then the task runs. Defaults to true.       |
|displayName     |  A unique string that identifies the task.       |
|description     | A string that describes the purpose of the task for administrative use. (Optional)         |
|executionSequence     | A read-only integer that states in what order the task runs in a workflow.      |
|continueOnError     |  A boolean value that determines if the failure of this task stops the subsequent workflows from running.        |
|arguments     |  Contains unique parameters relevant for the given task.       |

## Common email task parameters

Emails, sent from tasks, are able to be customized. If you choose to customize the email, you're able to set the following arguments:

- **Subject:** Customizes the subject of emails.
- **Message body:** Customizes the body of the emails being sent out.
- **Email language translation:** Overrides the email recipient's language settings. Custom text isn't customized, and it's recommended to set this language to the same language as the custom text. 

:::image type="content" source="media/lifecycle-workflow-task/customize-email-concept.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the customization email options.":::

For a step by step guide on this, see: [Customize emails sent out by workflow tasks](customize-workflow-email.md).

### Dynamic attributes within email

With customized emails, you're able to include dynamic attributes within the subject and body to personalize these emails. The list of dynamic attributes that can be included are as follows:


|Attribute  |Definition  |
|---------|---------|
|userDisplayName     | The user’s display name.        |
|userEmployeeHireDate     | The user’s employee hire date.        |
|userEmployeeLeaveDateTime     | The user’s employee leave date time.        |
|managerDisplayName     |  The display name of the user’s manager.        |
|temporaryAccessPass     |  The generated Temporary Access Pass. Only available with the **Generate TAP And Send Email** task.       |
|userPrincipalName     |  The user’s userPrincipalName.       |
|managerEmail     |  The manager’s email.        |
|userSurname     |  User’s last name.       |
|userGivenName     | User’s first name.        |


> [!NOTE]
> When adding these attributes to a customized email, or subject, they must be properly embedded. For a step by step guide on doing this, see: [Format attributes within customized emails](customize-workflow-email.md).

## Task details

In this section is each specific task, and detailed information such as parameters and prerequisites, required for them to run successfully. The parameters are noted as they appear both in the Microsoft Entra admin center, and within Microsoft Graph. For information about editing Lifecycle Workflow tasks in general, see: [Manage workflow Versions](manage-workflow-tasks.md).

### Generate Temporary Access Pass and send via email to user's manager

When a compatible user joins your organization, Lifecycle Workflows allow you to automatically generate a Temporary Access Pass (TAP), and have it sent to the new user's manager. You're also able to customize the email that is sent to the user's manager.

> [!NOTE]
> The user's employee hire date is used as the start time for the Temporary Access Pass. Please make sure that the TAP lifetime task setting and the [time portion of your user's hire date](how-to-lifecycle-workflow-sync-attributes.md#importance-of-time) are set appropriately so that the TAP is still valid when the user starts their first day. If the hire date at the time of workflow execution is already in the past, the current time is used as the start time.

With this task in the Microsoft Entra admin center, you're able to give the task a name and description. You must also set:

- **Activation duration**- How long the passcode is active.
- **One time use**- If the passcode can only be used once.
:::image type="content" source="media/lifecycle-workflow-task/tap-task.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Workflows task: TAP task.":::

The Microsoft Entra prerequisites to run the **Generate Temporary Access Pass and send via email to user's manager** task are:

- A populated manager attribute for the user.
- A populated manager's mail attribute for the user.
- The TAP tenant policy must be enabled and the selected values for activation duration and one time use must be within the allowed range of the policy. For more information, see [Enable the Temporary Access Pass policy](../identity/authentication/howto-authentication-temporary-access-pass.md#enable-the-temporary-access-pass-policy)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A user having this task run for them in a workflow must also not have any other authentication methods, sign-ins, or Microsoft Entra role assignments for this task to work for them.

For Microsoft Graph, the parameters for the **Generate Temporary Access Pass and send via email to user's manager** task are as follows:

|Parameter |Definition  |
|---------|---------|
|category    |  joiner      |
|displayName     | GenerateTAPAndSendEmail (Customizable by user)      |
|description     | Generate Temporary Access Pass and send via email to user's manager (Customizable by user)       |
|taskDefinitionId     |   1b555e50-7f65-41d5-b514-5894a026d10d     |
|arguments     |  Argument contains the name parameter "tapLifetimeInMinutes", which is the lifetime of the temporaryAccessPass in minutes starting at startDateTime. Minimum 10, Maximum 43200 (equivalent to 30 days). The argument also contains the tapIsUsableOnce parameter, which determines whether the passcode is limited to a one time use. If true, the pass can be used once; if false, the pass can be used multiple times within the temporaryAccessPass lifetime. Additionally, the optional common email task parameters can be specified; if they are not included, the default behavior takes effect.    |

Example of usage within the workflow:

```json
{
    "category": "joiner",
    "continueOnError": false,
    "description": "Generate Temporary Access Pass and send via email to user's manager",
    "displayName": "Generate TAP and Send Email",

        {
            "name": "tapIsUsableOnce",
            "value": "false"
        },
        {
            "name": "cc",

        }
    ]

### Enable user account

Allows cloud-only user accounts to be enabled. Users with Microsoft Entra role assignments aren't supported, nor are users with membership or ownership of role-assignable groups. You can utilize Microsoft Entra ID's HR driven provisioning to on-premises Active Directory to disable and enable synchronized accounts with an attribute mapping to `accountDisabled` based on data from your HR source. For more information, see: [Workday Configure attribute mappings](../identity/saas-apps/workday-inbound-tutorial.md#part-4-configure-attribute-mappings) and [SuccessFactors Configure attribute mappings](../identity/saas-apps/sap-successfactors-inbound-provisioning-tutorial.md#part-4-configure-attribute-mappings).

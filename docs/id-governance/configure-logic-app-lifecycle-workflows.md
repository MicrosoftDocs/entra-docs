# Configure a Logic App for Lifecycle Workflow use

Before you can use an existing Azure Logic App with the custom task extension feature of Lifecycle Workflows, it must first be made compatible. This reference guide provides a list of steps that must be taken to make the Azure Logic App compatible. For a guide on creating a new compatible Logic App via the Lifecycle Workflows portal, see [Trigger Logic Apps based on custom task extensions](trigger-custom-task.md).

## Determine type of token security of your custom task extension

Before configuring your Azure Logic App custom extension for use with Lifecycle Workflows, you must first figure out what type of token security it has. The two token security types can either be:

- Normal
- Proof of Possession(POP)

To determine the security token type of your custom task extension, you'd check the **Custom extensions** page:

:::image type="content" source="media/configure-logic-app-lifecycle-workflows/custom-task-extension-token-type.png" alt-text="Screenshot of custom task extension and token type.":::

> [!NOTE]
> New custom task extensions will only have Proof of Possession(POP) token security type. Only task extensions created before the inclusion of the Proof of Possession token security type will have a type of Normal.

## Configure existing Logic Apps for LCW use

Making an Azure Logic app compatible to run with the **Custom Task Extension** requires the following steps:

- Configure the logic app trigger
- Configure the callback action (Only applicable to the callback scenario.)
- Enable system assigned managed identity (Always required for Normal security token type extensions. This is also the default for callback scenarios with custom task extensions. For more information on this, and other, custom task extension deployment scenarios, see: [Custom task extension deployment scenarios](lifecycle-workflow-extensibility.md#custom-task-extension-deployment-scenarios).)
- Configure AuthZ policies

To configure those you follow these steps:

1. Open the Azure Logic App you want to use with Lifecycle Workflow. Logic Apps may greet you with an introduction screen, which you can close with the X in the upper right corner.

1. On the left of the screen, select **Logic App code view**.

1. In the editor paste the following code:

    ```

1. Select Save.

1. Switch to the **Logic App designer** and inspect the configured trigger and callback action. To build your custom business logic, add other actions between the trigger and callback action. If you're only interested in the fire-and-forget scenario, you may remove the callback action.

1. On the left of the screen, select **Identity**.

1. Under the system assigned tab, enable the status to register it with Microsoft Entra ID.

1. Select Save.

## Configure authorization policy for custom task extension with POP security token type
If the security token type is **Proof of Possession (POP)** for your custom task extension, you'd set the authorization policy by following these steps:

1. Go to the logic app you created and select **Authorization**.

1. Create an authorization policy based on the following table:

    Policy name: `POP-Policy` 

    Policy type: `AADPOP`
    
    |Claim  |Value  |
    |---------|---------|
    |Issuer     |  https://sts.windows.net/(Tenant ID)/       |
    |appid     |  00001111-aaaa-2222-bbbb-3333cccc4444   |
    |m     |  POST   |
    |u     |  management.azure.com   |
    |p     |  /subscriptions/(subscriptionId)/resourceGroups/(resourceGroupName)/providers/Microsoft.Logic/workflows/(LogicApp name)   |

1. Save the Authorization policy.

> [!CAUTION]
> Please pay attention to the details as minor differences can lead to problems later.

-	For `Issuer`, ensure you included the slash after your Tenant ID
-	For `appid`, ensure the custom claim is `appid` in all lowercase. The `appid` value represents Lifecycle Workflows and is always the same.

## Configure authorization policy for custom task extension with normal security token type

If the security token type is **Normal** for your custom task extension, you'd set the authorization policy by following these steps:

1. For Logic Apps authorization policy, we need the managed identities **Application ID**. Since the Microsoft Entra admin center only shows the Object ID, we need to look up the Application ID. You can search for the managed identity by Object ID under **Enterprise Applications** in the Microsoft Entra admin center to find the required Application ID.

1. Go back to the logic app you created, and select **Authorization**.

1. Create two authorization policies based on these tables:

    Policy name: `AzureADLifecycleWorkflowsAuthPolicy`

    Policy type: `AAD`
    
    |Claim  |Value  |
    |---------|---------|
    |Issuer     |  https://sts.windows.net/(Tenant ID)/       |
    |Audience     | Application ID of your Logic Apps Managed Identity       |
    |appid     |  00001111-aaaa-2222-bbbb-3333cccc4444   |

    Policy name: `AzureADLifecycleWorkflowsAuthPolicyV2App`

    Policy type: `AAD`
 
    |Claim  |Value  |
    |---------|---------|
    |Issuer     |  https://login.microsoftonline.com/(Tenant ID)/v2.0       |
    |Audience     | Application ID of your Logic Apps Managed Identity       |
    |azp     |  ce79fdc4-cd1d-4ea5-8139-e74d7dbe0bb7   |

1. Save the Authorization policy.

> [!CAUTION]
> Please pay attention to the details as minor differences can lead to problems later.

-	For `Issuer`, ensure you includes the slash after your Tenant ID.
-	For Audience, ensure you're using the Application ID and not the Object ID of your Managed Identity.
-	For `appid`, ensure the custom claim is `appid` in all lowercase. The `appid` value represents Lifecycle Workflows and is always the same.

## Using the Logic App with Lifecycle Workflows

Now that your Logic app is configured for use with Lifecycle Workflows, you can create a custom task extension via UI or API and use it in a Lifecycle Workflow.

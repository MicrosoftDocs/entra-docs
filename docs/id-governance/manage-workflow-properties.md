# Manage workflow properties

Managing workflows can be accomplished in one of two ways:  
   - Updating the basic properties of a workflow without creating a new version of it
   - Creating a new version of the updated workflow

You can update the following basic information without creating a new workflow.
   - display name
   - description
   - whether or not it's enabled
   - Whether or not workflow schedule is enabled
   - task name
   - task description

If you change any other parameters, a new version is required to be created as outlined in the [Managing workflow versions](manage-workflow-tasks.md) article.

If done via the Microsoft Entra admin center, the new version is created automatically. If done using Microsoft Graph, you must manually create a new version of the workflow.  For more information, see [Edit the properties of a workflow using Microsoft Graph](#edit-the-properties-of-a-workflow-using-microsoft-graph).

## Edit the properties of a workflow using the Microsoft Entra admin center

To edit the properties of a workflow using the Microsoft Entra admin center, you do the following steps:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Lifecycle Workflows Administrator](../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#lifecycle-workflows-administrator).

1. Browse to **Identity governance** > **Lifecycle workflows** > **workflows**.

1. Here you see a list of all of your current workflows. Select the workflow that you want to edit.

6. To change the display name or description, select **Properties**.

7. Update the display name or description how you want. 
> [!NOTE]
> Display names can not be the same as other existing workflows. They must have their own unique name.

8. Select **save**.

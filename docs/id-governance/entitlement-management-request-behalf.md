# Request access package on-behalf-of other users (Preview)

Entitlement Management enables admins to create access packages to manage their organization’s resources. Admins can either directly assign users to an access package, or configure an access package policy that allows users and group members to request access. This option to create self-service processes is useful, especially as organizations scale and hire more employees. However, new employees joining an organization might not always know what they need access to, or how they can request access. In this case, a new employee would likely rely on their manager to guide them through the access request process.

Instead of having new employees navigate the request process, managers can request access packages for their employees, making onboarding faster and more seamless. To enable this functionality for managers, admins can select an option when setting up an access package policy that allows managers to request access on their employees' behalf.

Expanding self-service request flows to allow requests on behalf of employees ensures that users have timely access to necessary resources, and increases productivity.


## Scenarios for managers requesting on behalf of employees

Imagine your organization hires hundreds of new employees each year, and you're being tasked with training new hires on IT processes, including how to request access for resources in My Access. Training sessions are only at the beginning of each month, so managers of new hires who start later in the month often reach out for ad-hoc training. This is becoming increasingly common.

Instead of conducting numerous ad-hoc training sessions to ensure new hires know how to request access in their first week or weeks at the organization, you can set up access package policies that allow managers to request access on behalf of their employees.

Now, managers are empowered to request access on behalf of new hires who haven't gone through the IT training. This ensures that employees have the tools and resources necessary to start on day one, and increases new hire satisfaction as they don’t need to wait for access or navigate the request process on their own.

## Approve access on behalf of employee requested by manager

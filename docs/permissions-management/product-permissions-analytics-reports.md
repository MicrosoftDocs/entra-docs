## Terminology and definitions

This list of terms and definitions are here to assist you in understanding the different types of identities and their privileges while viewing analytics reports. 

| Term | Definition | 
| ------ | ------ | 
| Granted permissions | The number of permissions granted due to directly attached policies, policies inherited from a group, and policies attached to a role that are assumed by an identity. |
| High-risk permission | Permissions that have the potential to cause data leakage, service disruption and degradation, or changes in security posture. |
| Identity | An identity is a human identity (user) or workload identity. There are different names and types of workload identities for each cloud. AWS: Lambda function (serverless function), role, resource. Azure: Azure function (serverless function), service principal. GCP: Cloud function (serverless function), service account. |
| Inactive group | Inactive groups have members who haven't used their granted permissions in the current environment (I.e. AWS Account)  in the last 90 days.    |
| Inactive identity | Inactive identities haven't used their granted permissions in the current environment (i.e. AWS Account) the last 90 days. |
| Over-provisioned active identity | Over-provisioned active identities aren't using all the permissions they've been granted in the current environment. |  
| Permission | A permission is an action an identity can perform on a resource. |
| Privilege escalation | Identities with privilege escalation can increase the number of permissions they've been granted. They can do this to potentially acquire full administrative control of the AWS account or GCP project. |
| Super identity | Super identities are granted permissions to all actions and resources in the current environment (i.e. AWS account). |
| Used permissions | The number of permissions used by an identity in the last 90 days. |

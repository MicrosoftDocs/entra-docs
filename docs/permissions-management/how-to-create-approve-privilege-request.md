# Create or approve a request for permissions

This article describes how to create or approve a request for permissions in the **Remediation** dashboard in Microsoft Entra Permissions Management. You can create and approve requests for the Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) authorization systems.

The **Remediation** dashboard has two privilege-on-demand (POD) workflows you can use:
- **New Request**: The workflow used by a user to create a request for permissions for a specified duration.
- **Approver**: The workflow used by an approver to review and approve or reject a user's request for permissions.


> [!NOTE]
> To view the **Remediation** dashboard, you must have **Viewer**, **Controller**, or **Administrator** permissions. To make changes on this tab, you must have **Controller** or **Administrator** permissions. If you don't have these permissions, contact your system administrator.

## Create a request for permissions

1. On the Permissions Management home page, select the **Remediation** tab, and then select the **My Requests** subtab.

    The **My Requests** subtab displays the following options:
    - **Pending**: A list of requests you've made but haven't yet been reviewed.
    - **Approved**: A list of requests that have been reviewed and approved by the approver. These requests have either already been activated or are in the process of being activated.
    - **Processed**: A summary of the requests you've created that have been approved (**Done**), **Rejected**, and requests that have been **Canceled**.

1. To create a request for permissions, select **New Request**.
1. In the **Roles/Tasks** page:
    1. From the **Authorization System Type** dropdown, select the authorization system type you want to access: **AWS**, **Azure** or **GCP**.
    1. From the **Authorization System** dropdown, select the accounts you want to access.
    1. From the **Identity** dropdown, select the identity on whose behalf you're requesting access.

        - If the identity you select is a Security Assertions Markup Language (SAML) user, and since a SAML user accesses the system through assumption of a role, select the user's role in **Role**.

        - If the identity you select is a local user, to select the policies you want:
            1. Select **Request Policy(s)**.
            1. In **Available Policies**, select the policies you want.
            1. To select a specific policy, select the plus sign, and then find and select the policy you want.

            The policies you've selected appear in the **Selected policies** box.

        - If the identity you select is a local user, to select the tasks you want:
            1. Select **Request Task(s)**.
            1. In **Available Tasks**, select the tasks you want.
            1. To select a specific task, select the plus sign, and then select the task you want.

            The tasks you've selected appear in the **Selected Tasks** box.

    If the user already has existing policies, they're displayed in **Existing Policies**.
1. Select **Next**.

1. If you selected **AWS**, the **Scope** page appears.

    1. In **Select Scope**, select:
        - **All Resources**
        - **Specific Resources**, and then select the resources you want.
        - **No Resources**
    1. In **Request Conditions**:
        1. Select **JSON** to add a JSON block of code.
        1. Select **Done** to accept the code you've entered, or **Clear** to delete what you've entered and start again.
    1. In **Effect**, select **Allow** or **Deny.**
    1. Select **Next**.

1. The **Confirmation** page appears.
1. In **Request Summary**, enter a summary for your request.
1. Optional: In **Note**, enter a note for the approver.
1. In **Schedule**, select when (how quickly) you want your request to be processed:
    - **ASAP**
    - **Once**
        - In **Create Schedule**, select the **Frequency**, **Date**, **Time**, and **For** the required duration, then select **Schedule**.
    - **Daily**
    - **Weekly**
    - **Monthly**
1. Select **Submit**.

    The following message appears: **Your Request Has Been Successfully Submitted.**

    The request you submitted is now listed in **Pending Requests**.


## Following are the time limits per frequency type while creating the request.

|Once                        |    2160                |
|Daily                        |    23                  |
|Weekly                        |    23                |

# Create a role/policy in the Remediation dashboard

This article describes how you can use the **Remediation** dashboard in Microsoft Entra Permissions Management to create roles/policies for the Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) authorization systems.

> [!NOTE]
> To view the **Remediation** tab, you must have **Viewer**, **Controller**, or **Administrator** permissions. To make changes on this tab, you must have **Controller** or **Administrator** permissions. If you don't have these permissions, contact your system administrator.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Azure uses the term *role* for what other cloud providers call *policy*. Permissions Management automatically makes this terminology change when you select the authorization system type. In the user documentation, we use *role/policy* to refer to both.

## Create a policy for AWS

> [!NOTE]
> For information on AWS service quotas, and to request an AWS service quota increase, visit [the AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html).

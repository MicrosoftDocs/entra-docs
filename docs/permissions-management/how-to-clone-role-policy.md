# Clone a role/policy in the Remediation dashboard

This article describes how you can use the **Remediation** dashboard in Microsoft Entra Permissions Management to clone roles/policies for the Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) authorization systems.

> [!NOTE]
> To view the **Remediation** tab, you must have **Viewer**, **Controller**, or **Administrator** permissions. To make changes on this tab, you must have **Controller** or **Administrator** permissions. If you don't have these permissions, contact your system administrator.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Azure uses the term *role* for what other Cloud providers call *policy*. Permissions Management automatically makes this terminology change when you select the authorization system type. In the user documentation, we use *role/policy* to refer to both.

## Clone a role/policy

1. On the Permissions Management home page, select the **Remediation** tab, and then select the **Role/Policies** tab.
1. Select the role/policy you want to clone, and from the **Actions** column, select **Clone**.
1. **(AWS Only)** In the **Clone** box, the **Clone Resources** and **Clone Conditions** checkboxes are automatically selected.
    Deselect the boxes if the resources and conditions are different from what is displayed.
1. Enter a name for each authorization system that was selected in the **Policy Name** boxes, and then select **Next**.
1. If the data collector hasn't been given controller privileges, the following message displays: **Only online/controller-enabled authorization systems can be submitted for cloning.**

   To clone this role manually, download the script and JSON file.

1. Select **Submit**.
1. Refresh the **Role/Policies** tab to see the role/policy you cloned.

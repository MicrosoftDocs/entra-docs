# View privileged role assignments in your organization

The **Microsoft Entra Insights** tab shows you who is assigned to privileged roles in your organization. You can review a list of identities assigned to a privileged role and learn more about each identity.

> [!NOTE] 
> Microsoft recommends that you keep two break glass accounts permanently assigned to the global administrator role. Make sure that these accounts don't require the same multi-factor authentication mechanism to sign in as other administrative accounts. This is described further in [Manage emergency access accounts in Microsoft Entra](~/identity/role-based-access-control/security-emergency-access.md). 

> [!NOTE] 
> Keep role assignments permanent if a user has an additional Microsoft account (for example, an account they use to sign in to Microsoft services like Skype or Outlook.com). If you require multi-factor authentication to activate a role assignment, a user with an additional Microsoft account will be locked out.  

## Prerequisite
To view information on the Microsoft Entra Insights tab, you must have Permissions Management Administrator role permissions.

# View system reports in the Reports dashboard

Permissions Management has various types of system report types available that capture specific sets of data. These reports allow management to:

- Make timely decisions.
- Analyze trends and system/user performance.
- Identify trends in data and high risk areas so that management can address issues more quickly and improve their efficiency.

## Explore the Reports dashboard

The **Reports** dashboard provides a table of information with both system reports and custom reports. The **Reports** dashboard defaults to the **System Reports** tab, which has the following details:

- **Report Name**: The name of the report.
- **Category**: The type of report. For example, **Permission**.
- **Authorization Systems**: Displays which authorizations the custom report applies to.
- **Format**: Displays the output format the report can be generated in. For example, comma-separated values (CSV) format, portable document format (PDF), or Microsoft Excel Open XML Spreadsheet (XLSX) format.

    - To download a report, select the down arrow to the right of the report name, or from the ellipses **(...)** menu, select **Download**.

      The following message displays across the top of the screen in green if the download is successful: **Successfully Started To Generate On Demand Report**.

# Configure Okta as an identity provider (preview)

This article describes how to integrate Okta as an identity provider (IdP) for an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account in Microsoft Entra Permissions Management. 

Permissions Required:


| **Account**                  | **Permissions Required**                                         |**Why?**                   |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Permissions Management   | Permissions Management Administrator     | Admin can create and edit the AWS authorization system onboarding configuration.   | 
| Okta                 | API Access Management Administrator     | Admin can add the application in the Okta portal and add or edit the API scope.    |
| AWS   | AWS permissions explicitly     |  Admin should be able to run the cloudformation stack to create  1. AWS Secret in Secrets Manager; 2. Managed policy to allow the role to read the AWS secret. | 

> [!NOTE]
> While configuring the Amazon Web Services (AWS) app in Okta, the suggested AWS role group syntax is (```aws#{account alias]#{role name}#{account #]```).
> Sample RegEx pattern for the group filter name are:
> - ```^aws\#\S+\#?{{role}}[\w\-]+)\#(?{{accountid}}\d+)$```
> - ```aws_(?{{accountid}}\d+)_(?{{role}}[a-zA-Z0-9+=,.@\-_]+)```
> Permissions Management reads default suggested filters. Custom RegEx expression for group syntax is not supported.

## How to configure Okta as an identity provider

1. Log in to the Okta portal with API Access Management Administrator. 
2. Create a new **Okta API Services Application**. 
3. In the Admin Console, go to Applications. 
4. On the Create a new app integration page, select **API Services**.
5. Enter a name for your app integration and click **Save**. 
6. Copy the **Client ID** for future use.  
7. In the **Client Credentials** section of the General tab, click **Edit** to change the client authentication method. 
8. Select **Public key/Private key** as the Client authentication method. 
9. Leave the default **Save keys in Okta**, then click **Add key**. 
10. Click **Add** and in the **Add a public key** dialog, either paste your own public key or click **Generate new key** to autogenerate a new 2048-bit RSA key. 
11. Copy **Public Key Id** for future use.  
12. Click **Generate new key** and the public and private keys appear in JWK format. 
13. Click **PEM**. The private key appears in PEM format. 
    This is your only opportunity to save the private key. Click **Copy to clipboard** to copy the private key and store it somewhere safe. 
14. Click **Done**. The new public key is now registered with the app and appears in a table in the **PUBLIC KEYS** section of the **General** tab. 
15. From the Okta API scopes tab, grant these scopes:
    - okta.users.read
    - okta.groups.read
    - okta.apps.read
16. Optional. Click the **Application rate limits** tab to adjust the rate-limit capacity percentage for this service application. By default, each new application sets this percentage at 50 percent. 

### Convert public key to a Base64 string

1. See instructions for [using a personal access token (PAT)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2249174).

### Find your Okta URL (also called an Okta domain)

This Okta URL/Okta domain is saved in the AWS secret.

1. Sign in to your Okta organization with your administrator account.
2. Look for the Okta URL/Okta domain in the global header of the dashboard. 
Once located, note the Okta URL in an app such as Notepad. You'll need this URL for your next steps. 

### Configure AWS stack details

1. Fill in the following fields on the **CloudFormation Template Specify stack details** screen using the information from your Okta application:
    - **Stack name** - A name of our choosing
    - **Or URL** Your organization's Okta URL, example: *https://companyname.okta.com*
    - **Client Id** - From the **Client Credentials** section of your Okta application
    - **Public Key Id** - Click **Add > Generate new key**. The public key is generated 
    - **Private Key (in PEM format)** - Base64 encoded string of the PEM format of the **Private key**
     > [!NOTE]
     > You must copy all text in the field before converting to a Base64 string, including the dash before BEGIN PRIVATE KEY and after END PRIVATE KEY.
2. When the **CloudFormation Template Specify stack details** screen is complete, click **Next**.
3. On the **Configure stack options** screen, click **Next**.
4. Review the information you've entered, then click **Submit**.
5. Select the **Resources** tab, then copy the **Physical ID** (this ID is the Secret ARN) for future use.

### Configure Okta in Microsoft Entra Permissions Management

> [!NOTE]
> Integrating Okta as an identity provider is an optional step. You can return to these steps to configure an IdP at any time. 

1. If the **Data Collectors** dashboard isn't displayed when Permissions Management launches, select **Settings** (gear icon), and then select the **Data Collectors** subtab.
2. On the **Data Collectors** dashboard, select **AWS**, and then select **Create Configuration**.
    Complete the **Manage Authorization System** steps.
    > [!NOTE]
    > If a Data Collector already exists in your AWS account and you want to add Okta integration, follow these steps:
    >  1. Select the Data Collector for which you want to add Okta integration.
    >  1. Click on the ellipsis next to the **Authorization System Status**.
    >  1. Select **Integrate Identity Provider**.

3. On the **Integrate Identity Provider (IdP)** page, select the box for **Okta**.
4. Select **Launch CloudFormation Template**. The template opens in a new window.
   > [!NOTE]
   > Here you'll fill in information to create a secret Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that you'll enter on the **Integrate Identity Provider (IdP)** page. Microsoft does not read or store this ARN.
5. Return to the Permissions Management **Integrate Identity Provider (IdP)** page and paste the **Secret ARN** in the field provided.
6. Click **Next** to review and confirm the information you've entered.
7. Click **Verify Now & Save**.
   The system returns the populated AWS CloudFormation Template.

# Define and manage users, roles, and access levels

In Permissions Management, a key component of the interface is the User management dashboard. This topic describes how system administrators can define and manage users, their roles, and their access levels in the system.

## The User management dashboard

The Permissions Management User management dashboard provides a high-level overview of:

- Registered and invited users.
- Permissions allowed for each user within a given system.
- Recent user activity.

It also provides the functionality to invite or delete a user, edit, view, and customize permissions settings.


## Manage users for customers without SAML integration

Follow this process to invite users if the customer hasn't enabled SAML integration with the Permissions Management application.

### Invite a user to Permissions Management

Inviting a user to Permissions Management adds the user to the system and allows system administrators to assign permissions to those users. Follow the steps to invite a user to Permissions Management.

1. To invite a user to Permissions Management, select the down caret icon next to the **User** icon on the right of the screen, and then select **User Management**.
2. From the **Users** tab, select **Invite User**.

        2. Select **Requestor for User** for each authorization system, if applicable.

           A user must have an account with a valid email address in the authorization system to select **Requestor for User**. If a user doesn't exist in the authorization system, **Requestor for User** is grayed out.
        3. Optional: To request access for multiple other identities, under **Requestor for Other Users**, select **Add**, and then select **Users**.

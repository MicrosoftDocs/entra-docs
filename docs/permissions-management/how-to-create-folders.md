# Create folders to organize your authorization systems

> [!NOTE]
> Effective April 1, 2025, Microsoft Entra Permissions Management will no longer be available for purchase, and on October 1, 2025, we'll retire and discontinue support of this product. More information can be found [here](https://aka.ms/MEPMretire).

After onboarding your cloud environment to Permissions Management, you might have multiple authorization systems (AWS accounts, Azure subscriptions, or GCP projects) that you need to manage. You can create folders to organize and group together your list of accounts, subscriptions, or projects to manage your workflow more efficiently. 

## Create a folder

1. On the Permissions Management home page, select the **Data Collectors** tab and make sure that the **Status** for your cloud environment is **Onboarded**.
1. Select the **Authorization Systems** subtab, then **Folders**.
1. Click **Create Folder**.
1. In the **Folder Name** field, enter a name for the folder you want to create.
1. From the list of names, select all Authorization Systems (accounts, subscriptions, or projects) you want to add to this folder.
1. Click **Save**. Your folder is created. 
1. Repeat these steps to create as many folders as you need.

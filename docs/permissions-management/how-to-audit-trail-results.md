# Generate an on-demand report from a query

> [!NOTE]
> Effective April 1, 2025, Microsoft Entra Permissions Management will no longer be available for purchase, and on October 1, 2025, we'll retire and discontinue support of this product. More information can be found [here](https://aka.ms/MEPMretire).

This article describes how you can generate an on-demand report from a query in the **Audit** dashboard in Permissions Management. You can:

- Run a report on-demand.
- Schedule and run a report as often as you want.
- Share a report with other members of your team and management.

## Generate a custom report on-demand

1. In the Permissions Management home page, select the **Audit** tab.

    Permissions Management displays the query options available to you.
1. In the **Audit** dashboard, select **Search** to run the query.
1. Select **Export**.

    Permissions Management generates the report and exports it in comma-separated values (**CSV**) format, portable document format (**PDF**), or Microsoft Excel Open XML Spreadsheet (**XLSX**) format.

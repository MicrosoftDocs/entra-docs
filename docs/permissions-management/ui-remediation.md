# View roles/policies and requests for permission in the Remediation dashboard

The **Remediation** dashboard in Permissions Management provides an overview of roles/policies, permissions, a list of existing requests for permissions, and requests for permissions you have made.

This article provides an overview of the components of the **Remediation** dashboard.

> [!NOTE]
> To view the **Remediation** dashboard, you must have **Viewer**, **Controller**, or **Approver** permissions. To make changes on this dashboard, you must have **Controller** or **Approver** permissions. If you don't have these permissions, contact your system administrator.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Azure uses the term *role* for what other cloud providers call *policy*. Permissions Management automatically makes this terminology change when you select the authorization system type. In the user documentation, we use *role/policy* to refer to both.

    The **Remediation** dashboard includes six subtabs:

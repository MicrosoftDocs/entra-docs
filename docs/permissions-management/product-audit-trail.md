# Filter and query user activity

The **Audit** dashboard in Permissions Management details all user activity performed in your authorization system. It captures all high risk activity in a centralized location, and allows system administrators to query the logs. The **Audit** dashboard enables you to:

- Create and save new queries so you can access key data points easily.
- Query across multiple authorization systems in one query.

## Filter information by authorization system

If you haven't used filters before, the default filter is the first authorization system in the filter list.

If you have used filters before, the default filter is last filter you selected.

1. To display the **Audit** dashboard, on the Permissions Management home page, select **Audit**.

1. To select your authorization system type, in the **Authorization System Type** box, select Amazon Web Services (**AWS**), Microsoft Azure (**Azure**), Google Cloud Platform (**GCP**), or Platform (**Platform**).

1. To select your authorization system, in the **Authorization System** box:

    - From the **List** subtab, select the accounts you want to use.
    - From the **Folders** subtab, select the folders you want to use.

1. To view your query results, select **Apply**.

## Create, view, modify, or delete a query

There are several different query parameters you can configure individually or in combination. The query parameters and corresponding instructions are listed in the following sections.

- To create a new query, select **New Query**.
- To view an existing query, select **View** (the eye icon).
- To edit an existing query, select **Edit** (the pencil icon).
- To delete a function line in a query, select **Delete** (the minus sign **-** icon).
- To create multiple queries at one time, select **Add New Tab** to the right of the **Query** tabs that are displayed.

  You can open a maximum number of six query tab pages at the same time. A message appears when you've reached the maximum.

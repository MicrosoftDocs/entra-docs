# Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

This article answers frequently asked questions (FAQs) about Microsoft Entra Permissions Management.

## What's Microsoft Entra Permissions Management?

Microsoft Entra Permissions Management (Permissions Management) is a cloud infrastructure entitlement management (CIEM) solution that provides comprehensive visibility into permissions assigned to all identities. For example, over-privileged workload and user identities, actions, and resources across multicloud infrastructures in Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Permissions Management detects, automatically right-sizes, and continuously monitors unused and excessive permissions. It deepens the Zero Trust security strategy by augmenting the least privilege access principle.

## What are the prerequisites to use Permissions Management?

Permissions Management supports data collection from AWS, GCP, and/or Microsoft Azure. For data collection and analysis, customers are required to have a Microsoft Entra account to use Permissions Management.

## Can a customer use Permissions Management if they have other identities with access to their IaaS platform that aren't yet in Microsoft Entra ID?

Yes, a customer can detect, mitigate, and monitor the risk for AWS IAM or GCP accounts, or from other identity providers such as Okta or AWS IAM.

## Where can customers access Permissions Management?

Customers can access the Permissions Management interface from the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/) .

## Can noncloud customers use Permissions Management on-premises?

No, Permissions Management is a hosted cloud offering.

## Can non-Azure customers use Permissions Management?

Yes, non-Azure customers can use our solution. Permissions Management is a multicloud solution so even customers who have no subscription to Azure can benefit from it.

## Is Permissions Management available for tenants hosted in the European Union (EU)?

Yes, Permissions Management is currently for tenants hosted in the European Union (EU).

## If I'm already using Microsoft Entra ID  Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for Azure, what value does Permissions Management provide?

Permissions Management complements Microsoft Entra PIM. Microsoft Entra PIM provides just-in-time access for admin roles in Azure and Microsoft Online Services and apps that use groups. Permissions Management allows multicloud discovery, remediation, and monitoring of privileged access across Azure, AWS, and GCP.

## What public cloud infrastructures does Permissions Management support?

Permissions Management currently supports the three major public clouds: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure.

## Does Permissions Management support hybrid environments?

Permissions Management currently doesn't support hybrid environments.

## What types of identities does Permissions Management support?

Permissions Management supports user identities (for example, employees, customers, external partners) and workload identities (for example, virtual machines, containers, web apps, serverless functions).

## Is Permissions Management available in Government Cloud?

No, Permissions Management is currently not available in Government clouds.

## Is Permissions Management available for sovereign clouds?

No, Permissions Management is currently not available in sovereign Clouds.

## How does Permissions Management collect insights about permissions usage?

Permissions Management has a data collector that collects access permissions that are assigned to various identities, activity logs, and resources metadata. The data collector provides full visibility into permissions granted to all identities to access the resources and details on usage of granted permissions.

## How does Permissions Management evaluate cloud permissions risk?

Permissions Management offers granular visibility into all identities and their permissions granted versus used, across cloud infrastructures to uncover any action performed by any identity on any resource. The visibility isn't limited to just user identities, but also workload identities such as virtual machines, access keys, containers, and scripts. The dashboard gives an overview of permission profile to locate the riskiest identities and resources.

## What is the Permissions Creep Index?

The Permissions Creep Index (PCI) is a quantitative measure of risk associated with an identity or role determined by comparing permissions granted versus permissions exercised. It allows users to instantly evaluate the level of risk associated with the number of unused or over-provisioned permissions across identities and resources. It measures how much damage identities can cause based on the permissions they have.

## How can customers use Permissions Management to delete unused or excessive permissions?

Permissions Management allows users to right-size excessive permissions and automate least privilege policy enforcement with just a few clicks. The solution continuously analyzes historical permission usage data for each identity and gives customers the ability to right-size the permissions of that identity to permissions that are only being used for day-to-day operations. All unused and other risky permissions can be automatically removed.

## Why is a user I deleted still visible in the Analytics tab?

Check to see if the user was assigned a *Classic Administrator* role. Classic admin roles don't go away when a user is deleted. To resolve this, go to the [Classic admin page](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2268264) and delete that role assignment separately for the user.

## How can customers grant permissions on-demand with Permissions Management?

For any break-glass or one-off scenarios where an identity needs to perform a specific set of actions on a set of specific resources, the identity can request those permissions on-demand for a limited period with a self-service workflow. Customers can either use the built-in workflow engine or their IT service management (ITSM) tool. The user experience is the same for any identity type, identity source (local, enterprise directory, or federated) and cloud.

## What is the difference between permissions on-demand and just-in-time access?

Just-in-time (JIT) access is a method used to enforce the principle of least privilege to ensure identities are given the minimum level of permissions to perform the task at hand. Permissions on-demand are a type of JIT access that allows the temporary elevation of permissions, enabling identities to access resources on a by-request, timed basis.

## How can customers monitor permissions usage with Permissions Management?

Customers only need to track the evolution of their Permission Creep Index (PCI) to monitor permissions usage. Customers can monitor PCI in the **Analytics** tab from their Permissions Management dashboard.

## Can customers generate permissions usage reports?

Yes, Permissions Management has various types of system report available that capture specific data sets. These reports allow customers to:
- Make timely decisions.
- Analyze usage trends and system/user performance.
- Identify high-risk areas.

For information about permissions usage reports, see [Generate and download the Permissions analytics report](product-permissions-analytics-reports.md).

## Does Permissions Management integrate with third-party ITSM (Information Technology Service Management) tools?

Integration with ITMS tools, such as ServiceNow, is in the future roadmap.

## How is Permissions Management being deployed?

Customers with Global Administrator role have first to onboard Permissions Management on their Microsoft Entra tenant, and then onboard their AWS accounts, GCP projects, and Azure subscriptions. More details about onboarding can be found in our product documentation.

## How long does it take to deploy Permissions Management?

It depends on each customer and how many AWS accounts, GCP projects, and Azure subscriptions they have.

## Once Permissions Management is deployed, how fast can I get permissions insights?

Once fully onboarded with data collection setup, customers can access permissions usage insights within hours. Our machine-learning engine refreshes the Permission Creep Index every hour so that customers can start their risk assessment right away.

## Is Permissions Management collecting and storing sensitive personal data?

No, Permissions Management doesn't have access to sensitive personal data.

## Where can I find more information about Permissions Management?

You can read our [blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/bg-p/Identity) and visit our [web page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-permissions-management). You can also get in touch with your Microsoft point of contact to schedule a demo.

## What is the data destruction/decommission process?

If a customer initiates a free Permissions Management 45-day trial and does not convert to a paid license within 45 days of the trial expiration, all collected data is deleted within 30 days of the trial expiration date.  

If a customer decides to discontinue licensing the service, all previously collected data is deleted within 30 days of license termination.

Customers can also remove, export or modify specific data if a Global Administrator using the Permissions Management service files an official Data Subject Request. To file a request:

If you're an enterprise customer, you can contact your Microsoft representative, account team, or tenant admin to file a high-priority IcM support ticket requesting a Data Subject Request. Do not include details or any personally identifiable information in the IcM request. We'll reach out to you for these details only after an IcM is filed.

If you're a self-service customer (you set up a trial or paid license in the Microsoft 365 admin center) you can contact the Permissions Management privacy team by selecting your profile drop-down menu, then **Account Settings** in Permissions Management. Follow the instructions to make a Data Subject Request.

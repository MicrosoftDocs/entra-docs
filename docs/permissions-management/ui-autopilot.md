# View information about rules in the Autopilot dashboard

The **Autopilot** dashboard in Permissions Management provides a table of information about Autopilot rules for administrators. Creating Autopilot rules allows you to automate right-sizing policies so you can automatically remove unused roles and permissions assigned to identities in your authorization system. From the Autopilot dashboard, you can view information on all current rules, including names, rule type, rule notification settings, and more. 


> [!NOTE]
> Only users with **Administrator** permissions can view and make changes on the Autopilot tab.

## View a list of rules

1. From the Permissions Management home page, select the **Autopilot** tab.
1. In the **Autopilot** dashboard, from the **Authorization system types** dropdown, select the authorization system types you want: Amazon Web Services (**AWS**), Microsoft **Azure**, or Google Cloud Platform (**GCP**).
1. From the **Authorization System** dropdown, in the **List** and **Folders** box, select the account and folder names that you want.
1. Select **Apply**.

    The following information displays in the **Autopilot Rules** table:

    - **Rule Name**: The name of the rule.
    - **State**: The status of the rule: idle (not in use) or active (in use).
    - **Rule Type**: The type of rule that's applied.
    - **Mode**: The status of the mode: on-demand or not.
    - **Last Generated**: The date and time the rule was last generated.
    - **Created By**: The email address of the user who created the rule.
    - **Last Modified**: The date and time the rule was last modified.
    - **Subscription**: Provides an **On** or **Off** subscription that allows you to receive email notifications when recommendations are generated, applied, or unapplied.

## View notification settings for a rule

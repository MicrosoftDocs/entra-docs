# Delete a role/policy in the Remediation dashboard

This article describes how you can use the **Remediation** dashboard in Microsoft Entra Permissions Management to delete roles/policies for the Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) authorization systems.

> [!NOTE]
> To view the **Remediation** dashboard, you must have **Viewer**, **Controller**, or **Administrator** permissions. To make changes on this tab, you must have **Controller** or **Administrator** permissions. If you don't have these permissions, contact your system administrator.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Azure uses the term *role* for what other Cloud providers call *policy*. Permissions Management automatically makes this terminology change when you select the authorization system type. In the user documentation, we use *role/policy* to refer to both.

## Delete a role/policy

1. On the Permissions Management home page, select the **Remediation** tab, and then select the **Role/Policies** subtab.
1. Select the role/policy you want to delete, and from the **Actions** column, select **Delete**.

    You can only delete a role/policy if it isn't assigned to an identity.

    You can't delete system roles/policies.

1. On the **Preview** page, review the role/policy information to make sure you want to delete it, and then select **Submit**.

## Next steps


- To view existing roles/policies, requests, and permissions, see [View roles/policies, requests, and permission in the Remediation dashboard](ui-remediation.md).

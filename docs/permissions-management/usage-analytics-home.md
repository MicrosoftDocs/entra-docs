# View analytic information with the Analytics dashboard

This article provides a brief overview of the Analytics dashboard in Permissions Management, and the type of analytic information it provides for Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

## Display the Analytics dashboard

- From the Permissions Management home page, select the **Analytics** tab.

    The **Analytics** dashboard displays detailed information about:

    - **Users**: Tracks assigned permissions and usage by users. For more information, see [View analytic information about users](usage-analytics-users.md).

    - **Groups**: Tracks assigned permissions and usage of the group and the group members.  For more information, see [View analytic information about groups](usage-analytics-groups.md).

    - **Active Resources**: Tracks resources that have been used in the last 90 days.  For more information, see [View analytic information about active resources](usage-analytics-active-resources.md).

    - **Active Tasks**: Tracks tasks that have been performed in the last 90 days.  For more information, see [View analytic information about active tasks](usage-analytics-active-tasks.md).

    - **Access Keys**: Tracks the permission usage of access keys for a given user.  For more information, see [View analytic information about access keys](usage-analytics-access-keys.md).

    - **Serverless Functions**: Tracks assigned permissions and usage of the serverless functions for AWS only.  For more information, see [View analytic information about serverless functions](usage-analytics-serverless-functions.md).

    System administrators can use this information to make decisions about granting permissions and reducing risk on unused permissions.

    The **Alerts** dashboard has four tabs:

    - **Statistical Anomaly**
    - **Permission Analytics**

    Each tab has two subtabs:

    - **Alerts**
    - **Alert Triggers**
      
- Select the **Authorization system**(s) and/or **folder**(s) to display alerts and alert triggers in scope of the selected view. 
- Alert triggers are based on data collected. All alerts, if triggered, are shown every hour under the Alerts subtab.

# View analytic information about users

The **Analytics** dashboard in Permissions Management collects detailed information, analyzes, reports on, and visualizes data about all identity types. System administrators can use the information to make informed decisions about granting permissions and reducing risk on unused permissions for:

- **Users**: Tracks assigned permissions and usage of various identities.
- **Groups**: Tracks assigned permissions and usage of the group and the group members.
- **Active Resources**: Tracks active resources (used in the last 90 days).
- **Active Tasks**: Tracks active tasks (performed in the last 90 days).
- **Access Keys**: Tracks the permission usage of access keys for a given user.
- **Serverless Functions**: Tracks assigned permissions and usage of the serverless functions.

This article describes how to view usage analytics about users.

## Create a query to view users

When you select **Users**, the **Analytics** dashboard provides a high-level overview of tasks used by various identities.

1. On the main **Analytics** dashboard, select **Users** from the  drop-down list at the top of the screen.

    The following components make up the **Users** dashboard:

    - **Authorization System Type**: Select the authorization you want to use: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
    - **Authorization System**: Select from a **List** of accounts and **Folders***.
    - **Identity Type**: Select **All** identity types, **User**, **Role/App/Service a/c** or **Resource**.
    - **Search**: Enter criteria to find specific tasks.
1. Select **Apply** to display the criteria you've selected.

    Select **Reset filter** to discard your changes.


## View the results of your query

The **Identities** table displays the results of your query.

- **Name**: Provides the name of the group.
    - To view details about the group, select the down arrow.
- The **Domain/Account** name.
- The **Permission Creep Index (PCI)**: Provides the following information:
    - **Index**: A numeric value assigned to the PCI.
    - **Since**: How many days the PCI value has been at the displayed level.

-  The ellipses **(...)**: Select **Tags** to add a tag.

    If you're using AWS, another selection is available from the ellipses menu: **Auto Remediate**. You can use this option to remediate your results automatically.

## Add a tag to a user

1. To add the tag to the serverless function, select **Add Tag**.

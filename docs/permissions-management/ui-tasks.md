# View information about active and completed tasks

This article describes the usage of the **Permissions Management Tasks** pane in Permissions Management.

## Display active and completed tasks
You can display both active and completed tasks in Permissions Management. This section will show you how to access the Tasks pane, view details about active and completed tasks, and understand the status of each task.

1. In the Permissions Management home page, select **Tasks** (the timer icon).

    The **Permissions Management Tasks** pane appears on the right of the Permissions Management home page. It has two tabs:
    - **Active**: Displays a list of active tasks, a description of each task, and when the task was started.

         If there are no active tasks, the following message displays: **There are no active tasks**.
    - **Completed**: Displays a list of completed tasks, a description of each task, when the task was started and ended, and whether the task **Failed** or **Succeeded**.

         If there are no completed activities, the following message displays: **There are no recently completed tasks**.
1. To close the **Permissions Management Tasks** pane, click outside the pane.

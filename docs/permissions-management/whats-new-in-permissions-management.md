# What's new in Microsoft Entra Permissions Management

This article provides the latest Public Preview and General Availability of features in Microsoft Entra Permissions Management. 

## March 2023

### Public Preview - Support for PIM-enabled Groups 
**Type:** Changed feature   
**Service category:**                      
**Product capability:** Permissions Management  

As multiple customers embrace PIM for groups as a popular feature, Microsoft Entra Permissions Management adds the support to read the just-in-time membership impact on the eligible granted Azure RBAC permissions and Permissions Creep Index (PCI). The feature enables the complete visibility into RBAC permissions assigned to the identities in different ways.  
 
In the Permissions Management console, admins can see the membership eligibility status as well as role eligibility status for Groups. For each identity, admins can get the visibility into the membership eligibility status as well as roles eligibility status. 


## December 2023

### General availability - Permissions Analytics Report PDF

**Type:** Changed feature   
**Service category:**                      
**Product capability:** Permissions Management  

The [Permissions Analytics Report (PAR)](product-permissions-analytics-reports.md) lists findings relating to permissions risks across identities and resources in Permissions Management. The PAR is an integral part of the risk assessment process where customers discover areas of highest risk in their cloud infrastructure. This report can be directly viewed in the Permissions Management UI, downloaded in Excel (XSLX) format, and exported as a PDF. The report is available for all supported cloud environments: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). 

The PAR PDF is one part of the overall reporting redesign effort led by the engineering team. As part of this feature release, customers can download all reports (system or custom) with no row limitations in CSV and XSLX formats.

### General availability - ServiceNow app for Permissions Management

**Type:** New feature   
**Service category:**                        
**Product capability:** Permissions Management

The ServiceNow Application for Microsoft Entra Permissions Management enables users to request time-bound, on-demand permissions for multicloud environments (Azure, AWS, GCP) through the ServiceNow portal. This integration aids organizations in enhancing their Zero Trust posture by enforcing the principle of least privilege for multicloud permissions. The ServiceNow app streamlines access permission requests within existing approval workflows.  

Get the ServiceNow app in the [ServiceNow app store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/24073ae31bfca9100e564082b24bcb56/1.0.1?referer=%2Fstore%2Fsearch%3Flistingtype%3Dallintegrations%25253Bancillary_app%25253Bcertified_apps%25253Bcontent%25253Bindustry_solution%25253Boem%25253Butility%25253Btemplate%25253Bgenerative_ai%25253Bsnow_solution%26q%3Dentra%2520permissions%2520management&sl=sh). 

### Public preview - Okta and AWS Identity Center identity provider integrations

**Type:** New feature   
**Service category:**                        
**Product capability:** Permissions Management

Permissions Management supports third party identity providers (IdP) integration to get more insight of single sign-on data of permissions assigned in cloud environments. With this information, Permissions Management can provide more accurate analytics. By reading role assignments and user data from the IdP side, Permissions Management more effectively calculates permissions granted, and as a result, reads more precise data on permissions creep. 

For [Okta Identity Provider integration](how-to-configure-okta-as-an-identity-provider.md), an admin needs to configure the API application to give the access to read Okta users, groups, and apps via Okta APIs. Permissions Management reads Okta users, groups, and apps via Okta APIs. 

For [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Identity Center integration](how-to-configure-aws-iam.md), an admin can provide Permissions Management access to read user and role access configuration data from the management account by running the CloudFormation template (CFT) in their AWS environment. After successful configuration, Permissions Management can read the data to calculate the analytics.

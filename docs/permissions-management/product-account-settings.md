# View personal and organization information

> [!NOTE]
> Effective April 1, 2025, Microsoft Entra Permissions Management will no longer be available for purchase, and on October 1, 2025, we'll retire and discontinue support of this product. More information can be found [here](https://aka.ms/MEPMretire).

The **Account settings** dashboard in Permissions Management allows you to view personal information, passwords, and account preferences.
This information can't be modified because the user information is pulled from Microsoft Entra-only **User Session Time(min)**.

## View personal information

- From the Permissions Management home page, select the down arrow to the right of the **User** (your initials) menu, then select **Account Settings**.

    The **Personal Information** box displays your **First Name**, **Last Name**, and the **Email Address** used to register your account with Permissions Management.

## View current organization information

1. From the Permissions Management home page, select the down arrow to the right of the **User** (your initials) menu, then select **Account Settings**.

    The **Current Organization Information** displays the **Name** of your organization, the **Tenant ID** box, and the **User Session Timeout (min)**.

1. To change duration of the **User Session Timeout (min)**, select **Edit** (the pencil icon), then enter the number of minutes before you want a user session to time out.
1. Select the checkmark to confirm your new setting.

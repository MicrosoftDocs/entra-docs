# Modify a role/policy in the Remediation dashboard

This article describes how you can use the **Remediation** dashboard in Microsoft Entra Permissions Management to modify roles/policies for the Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) authorization systems.

> [!NOTE]
> To view the **Remediation** tab, you must have **Viewer**, **Controller**, or **Administrator** permissions. To make changes on this tab, you must have **Controller** or **Administrator** permissions. If you don't have these permissions, contact your system administrator.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Azure uses the term *role* for what other cloud providers call *policy*. Permissions Management automatically makes this terminology change when you select the authorization system type. In the user documentation, we use *role/policy* to refer to both.

## Modify a role/policy

1. On the Permissions Management home page, select the **Remediation** tab, and then select the **Role/Policies** tab.
1. Select the role/policy you want to modify, and from the **Actions** column, select **Modify**.

     You can't modify **System** policies and roles.

1. On the **Statements** page, make your changes to the **Tasks**, **Resources**, **Request conditions**, and **Effect** sections as required, and then select **Next**.

1. Review the changes to the JSON or script on the **Preview** page, and then select **Submit**.

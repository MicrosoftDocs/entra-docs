# View billable resources listed in your authorization system

Gain insight into current billable resources listed in your authorization system. In Microsoft Entra Permissions Management, a billable resource is defined as a cloud service that uses compute or memory and requires a license. The Permissions Management Billable Resources tab shows you which resources are in your authorization system, and how many of them you're being billed for.

Here's the current list of resources per cloud provider. This list is subject to change as cloud providers add more services in the future.

    The **Triggers** table in the **Alert Triggers** subtab displays your alert trigger.

## View an activity alert

1. In the **Activity** tab, select the **Alerts** subtab.
1. From the **Alert Name** dropdown, select an alert.

    If you select **Custom Range**, select date and time settings, and then select **Apply**.

    The **Alerts** table displays information about your alert.

    Select the alert name to view the individual activities and further details about the **resources**, **tasks**, and **identities** involved.


## View activity alert triggers

1. In the Permissions Management home page, select **Activity triggers** (the bell icon).
1. In the **Activity** tab, select the **Alert Triggers** subtab.
1. From the **Status** dropdown, select **All**, **Activated** or **Deactivated**, then select **Apply**.

    The **Triggers** table displays the following information:

    - **Alerts**: The name of the alert trigger.
    - **# of users subscribed**: The number of users who have subscribed to a specific alert trigger.

        - Select a number in this column to view information about the user.

    - **Created By**: The email address of the user who created the alert trigger.
    - **Modified By**: The email address of the user who last modified the alert trigger.
    - **Last Updated**: The date and time the alert trigger was last updated.
    - **Subscription**: A switch that displays if the alert is **On** or **Off**.

         - If the column displays **Off**, the current user isn't subscribed to that alert. Switch the toggle to **On** to subscribe to the alert.
         - The user who creates an alert trigger is automatically subscribed to the alert, and receives emails about the alert.

1. To see only activated or only deactivated triggers, from the **Status** dropdown, select **Activated** or **Deactivated**, and then select **Apply**.

1. To view other options available to you, select the ellipses (**...**), and then select from the available options.

    If the **Subscription** is **On**, the following options are available:

    - **Edit**: Enables you to modify alert parameters

       > [!NOTE]
         > Only the user who created the alert can perform the following actions: edit the trigger screen, rename an alert, deactivate an alert, and delete an alert. Changes made by other users aren't saved.

    - **Duplicate**: Create a duplicate of the alert called "**Copy of XXX**".
    - **Rename**: Enter the new name of the query, and then select **Save.**
    - **Deactivate**: The alert is listed, but no longer sends emails to subscribed users.
    - **Activate**: Activate the alert trigger and start sending emails to subscribed users.
    - **Notification Settings**: View the **Email** of users who are subscribed to the alert trigger and their **User Status**.
    - **Delete**: Delete the alert.

    If the **Subscription** is **Off**, the following options are available:
    - **View**: View  details of the alert trigger.
    - **Notification Settings**: View the **Email** of users who are subscribed to the alert trigger and their **User Status**.
    - **Duplicate**: Create a duplicate copy of the selected alert trigger.

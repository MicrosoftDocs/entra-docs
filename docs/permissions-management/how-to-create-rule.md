# Create a rule in the Autopilot dashboard

This article describes how to create a rule in the Permissions Management **Autopilot** dashboard.

> [!NOTE]
> Only users with **Administrator** permissions can view and make changes on the Autopilot tab. If you don't have these permissions, contact your system administrator.

## Create a rule

1. In the Permissions Management home page, select the **Autopilot** tab.
1. In the **Autopilot** dashboard, from the **Authorization system types** dropdown, select Amazon Web Services (**AWS**), Microsoft **Azure**, or Google Cloud Platform (**GCP**).
1. From the **Authorization System** dropdown, in the **List** and **Folders** box, select the account and folder names that you want, and then select **Apply**.
1. In the **Autopilot** dashboard, select **New Rule**.
1. In the **Rule Name** box, enter a name for your rule.
1. Select **AWS**, **Azure**, **GCP**, and then select **Next**.

1. Select **Authorization Systems**, and then select **All** or the account names that you want.
1. From the **Folders** dropdown, select a folder, and then select **Apply**.

    To change your folder settings, select **Reset**.

    - The **Status** column displays if the authorization system is **Online** or **Offline**.
    - The **Controller** column displays if the controller is **Enabled** or **Not Enabled**.


1. Select **Configure** , and then select the following parameters for your rule:

    - **Role Created On Is**: Select the duration in days.
    - **Role Last Used On Is**: Select the duration in days when the role was last used.

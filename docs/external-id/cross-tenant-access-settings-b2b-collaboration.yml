  Configure cross-tenant access settings for B2B collaboration
introduction: |
  [!INCLUDE [applies-to-workforce-only](./includes/applies-to-workforce-only.md)]

  Use External Identities cross-tenant access settings to manage how you collaborate with other Microsoft Entra organizations through B2B collaboration. These settings determine both the level of *inbound* access users in external Microsoft Entra organizations have to your resources, and the level of *outbound* access your users have to external organizations. They also let you trust multifactor authentication (MFA) and device claims ([compliant claims and Microsoft Entra hybrid joined claims](~/identity/conditional-access/policy-alt-all-users-compliant-hybrid-or-mfa.md)) from other Microsoft Entra organizations. For details and planning considerations, see [Cross-tenant access in Microsoft Entra External ID](cross-tenant-access-overview.md).

  **Collaboration across clouds:** Partner organizations in different Microsoft clouds can set up B2B collaboration with each other. First, both organizations must enable collaboration with each other as described in [Configure Microsoft cloud settings](cross-cloud-settings.md). Then each organization can optionally modify their [inbound access settings](#modify-inbound-access-settings) and [outbound access settings](#modify-outbound-access-settings), as described below.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Microsoft is beginning to move customers using cross-tenant access settings to a new storage model on August 30, 2023. You may notice an entry in your audit logs informing you that your cross-tenant access settings were updated as our automated task migrates your settings. For a brief window while the migration processes, you will be unable to make changes to your settings. If you are unable to make a change, you should wait a few moments and try the change again. Once the migration completes, [you will no longer be capped with 25kb of storage space](./faq.yml#how-many-organizations-can-i-add-in-cross-tenant-access-settings-) and there will be no more limits on the number of partners you can add.

  summary: |
    > [!CAUTION]
    > Changing the default inbound or outbound settings to **Block access** could block existing business-critical access to apps in your organization or partner organizations. Be sure to use the tools described in [Cross-tenant access in Microsoft Entra External ID](cross-tenant-access-overview.md) and consult with your business stakeholders to identify the required access.

    - Review the [Important considerations](cross-tenant-access-overview.md#important-considerations) section in the [cross-tenant access overview](cross-tenant-access-overview.md) before configuring your cross-tenant access settings.
    - Use the tools and follow the recommendations in [Identify inbound and outbound sign-ins](cross-tenant-access-overview.md#identify-inbound-and-outbound-sign-ins) to understand which external Microsoft Entra organizations and resources users are currently accessing.
    - Decide on the default level of access you want to apply to all external Microsoft Entra organizations.
    - Identify any Microsoft Entra organizations that need customized settings so you can configure **Organizational settings** for them.
    - If you want to apply access settings to specific users, groups, or applications in an external organization, you need to contact the organization for information before configuring your settings. Obtain their user object IDs, group object IDs, or application IDs (*client app IDs* or *resource app IDs*) so you can target your settings correctly.
    - If you want to set up B2B collaboration with a partner organization in an external Microsoft Azure cloud, follow the steps in [Configure Microsoft cloud settings](cross-cloud-settings.md). An admin in the partner organization needs to do the same for your tenant.
    - Both allow/block list and cross-tenant access settings are checked at the time of invitation. If a user's domain is on the allowlist, they can be invited, unless the domain is explicitly blocked in the cross-tenant access settings. If a user's domain is on the blocklist, they can't be invited regardless of the cross-tenant access settings. If a user isn't on either list, we check the cross-tenant access settings to determine whether they can be invited.

    summary: |
      With inbound settings, you select which external users and groups are able to access the internal applications you choose. Whether you're configuring default settings or organization-specific settings, the steps for changing inbound cross-tenant access settings are the same. As described in this section, you navigate to either the **Default** tab or an organization on the **Organizational settings** tab, and then make your changes.

      1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Security Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#security-administrator).

      2. Browse to **Identity** > **External Identities** > **Cross-tenant access settings**.

          - **Default settings**: To modify default inbound settings, select the **Default settings** tab, and then under **Inbound access settings**, select **Edit inbound defaults**.
          - **Organizational settings**: To modify settings for a specific organization, select the **Organizational settings** tab, find the organization in the list (or [add one](#add-an-organization)), and then select the link in the **Inbound access** column.

      4. Follow the detailed steps for the inbound settings you want to change:

          - [To change inbound B2B collaboration settings](#to-change-inbound-b2b-collaboration-settings)
          - [To change inbound trust settings for accepting MFA and device claims](#to-change-inbound-trust-settings-for-mfa-and-device-claims)
            
      > [!NOTE]
      > If you are using the native sharing capabilities in Microsoft SharePoint and [Microsoft OneDrive with Microsoft Entra B2B integration](/sharepoint/sharepoint-azureb2b-integration) enabled, you must add the external domains to the [external collaboration settings](/entra/external-id/external-collaboration-settings-configure). Otherwise, invitations from these applications might fail, even if the external tenant has been added in the cross-tenant access settings.

      ### To change inbound B2B collaboration settings

      1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Security Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#security-administrator).

      2. Browse to **Identity** > **External Identities** > **Cross-tenant access settings**, then select **Organizational settings** 

      3. Select the link in the **Inbound access** column and the **B2B collaboration** tab.

      4. If you're configuring inbound access settings for a specific organization, select an option:

          - **Default settings**: Select this option if you want the organization to use the default inbound settings (as configured on the **Default** settings tab). If customized settings were already configured for this organization, you need to select **Yes** to confirm that you want all settings to be replaced by the default settings. Then select **Save**, and skip the rest of the steps in this procedure.

          - **Customize settings**: Select this option if you want to customize the settings to enforce for this organization instead of the default settings. Continue with the rest of the steps in this procedure.

      5. Select **External users and groups**.

      6. Under **Access status**, select one of the following:

          - **Allow access**: Allows the users and groups specified under **Applies to** to be invited for B2B collaboration.
          - **Block access**: Blocks the users and groups specified under **Applies to** from being invited to B2B collaboration.

      14. Select **Save**.

      ### Considerations for allowing Microsoft applications

      If you want to configure **Cross-tenant access settings** to allow only a designated set of applications, consider adding the Microsoft applications shown in the following table. For example, if you configure an allow list and only allow SharePoint Online, the user can't access My Apps or register for MFA in the resource tenant. To ensure a smooth end user experience, include the following applications in your inbound and outbound collaboration settings.

      |Application|Resource ID|Available in portal|Details|
      |----|----|----|----|
      |My Apps|2793995e-0a7d-40d7-bd35-6968ba142197|Yes|Default landing page after redeemed invitation. Defines access to `myapplications.microsoft.com`.|
      |Microsoft App Access Panel|0000000c-0000-0000-c000-000000000000|No|Used in some late-bound calls when loading certain pages within My Sign ins. For example, the Security Info blade or the Organizations switcher.|
      |My Profile|8c59ead7-d703-4a27-9e55-c96a0054c8d2|Yes|Defines access to `myaccount.microsoft.com` including My Groups and My Access portals. Some tabs within My Profile require the other apps listed here in order to work.|
      |My Sign ins|19db86c3-b2b9-44cc-b339-36da233a3be2|No|Defines access to `mysignins.microsoft.com` including access to Security Info. Allow this app if you require users to register for and use MFA in the resource tenant (for example, MFA isn't trusted from the home tenant).|

      Some of the applications in the previous table don't allow selection from the Microsoft Entra admin center. To allow them, add them with Microsoft Graph API as shown in the following example:

      ```json
      PATCH https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/policies/crossTenantAccessPolicy/partners/<insert partner’s tenant id> 
      { 
          "b2bCollaborationInbound": { 
              "applications": { 
                  "accessType": "allowed", 
                  "targets": [ 
                      { 
                          "target": "2793995e-0a7d-40d7-bd35-6968ba142197", 
                          "targetType": "application" 
                      }, 
                      { 
                          "target": "0000000c-0000-0000-c000-000000000000", 
                          "targetType": "application" 
                      }, 
                      { 
                          "target": "8c59ead7-d703-4a27-9e55-c96a0054c8d2", 
                          "targetType": "application" 
                      }, 
                      { 
                          "target": "19db86c3-b2b9-44cc-b339-36da233a3be2", 
                          "targetType": "application" 
                      } 
                  ] 
              } 
          } 
      }
      ```
      > [!NOTE]
      > Be sure to include any additional applications you want to allow in the PATCH request as this will overwrite any previously configured applications. Applications that are already configured can be retrieved manually from the portal or by running a GET request on the partner policy. For example, `GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/policies/crossTenantAccessPolicy/partners/<insert partner's tenant id>`

      > [!NOTE]
      > Applications added via Microsoft Graph API that do not map to an application available in the Microsoft Entra admin center will be displayed as the app ID.

      You can't add the Microsoft Admin Portals app to the inbound and outbound cross-tenant access settings in the Microsoft Entra admin center. To allow external access to Microsoft admin portals, use the Microsoft Graph API to individually add the following apps that are part of the Microsoft Admin Portals app group: 
      - Azure portal (c44b4083-3bb0-49c1-b47d-974e53cbdf3c) 
      - Microsoft Entra admin center (c44b4083-3bb0-49c1-b47d-974e53cbdf3c) 
      - Microsoft 365 Defender Portal (80ccca67-54bd-44ab-8625-4b79c4dc7775) 
      - Microsoft Intune Admin Center (80ccca67-54bd-44ab-8625-4b79c4dc7775) 
      - Microsoft Purview Compliance Portal (80ccca67-54bd-44ab-8625-4b79c4dc7775)

      ### Configure redemption order

      To customize the order of identity providers that your guest users can use to sign in when they accept your invitation, follow these steps.

      1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/) as at least a [Security Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#security-administrator). Then open the **Identity** service on the left hand side.

      2. Select **External Identities** > **Cross-tenant access settings**.

      3. On the **Default settings** tab, under **Inbound access settings**, select **Edit inbound defaults**.

      4. On the **B2B collaboration** tab, select the **Redemption order** tab.

      5. Move the identity providers up or down to change the order in which your guest users can sign in when they accept your invitation. You can also reset the redemption order to the default settings here.

          :::image type="content" source="media/cross-tenant-access-overview/redemption-order-tab-entra.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the redemption order tab." lightbox="media/cross-tenant-access-overview/redemption-order-tab-entra.png":::

      6. Select **Save**.

        You can also customize the redemption order via the Microsoft Graph API.

      1. Open the [Microsoft Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/graph-explorer).

      2. Sign in as at least a [Security Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#security-administrator) to your resource tenant.

      3. Run the following query to get the current redemption order:

        ```http
        GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/policies/crossTenantAccessPolicy/default
        ```

      4. In this example, we'll move the SAML/WS-Fed IdP federation to the top of the redemption order above Microsoft Entra identity provider. Patch the same URI with this request body:

        ```http
        {
          "invitationRedemptionIdentityProviderConfiguration":
          {
          "primaryIdentityProviderPrecedenceOrder": ["ExternalFederation ","AzureActiveDirectory"],
          "fallbackIdentityProvider": "defaultConfiguredIdp "
          }
        }
        ```

      5. To verify the changes run the GET query again.

      6. To reset the redemption order to the default settings, run the following query:

        ```http
            {
            "invitationRedemptionIdentityProviderConfiguration": {
            "primaryIdentityProviderPrecedenceOrder": [
            "azureActiveDirectory",
            "externalFederation",
            "socialIdentityProviders"
            ],
            "fallbackIdentityProvider": "defaultConfiguredIdp"
            }
            }
        ```

      <a name='samlws-fed-federation-direct-federation-for-azure-ad-verified-domains-preview'></a>

      ### SAML/WS-Fed federation (Direct federation) for Microsoft Entra ID verified domains

      You can now add your enlisted Microsoft Entra ID verified domain to set up the direct federation relationship. First you need to set up the Direct federation configuration in the [admin center](direct-federation.md) or via the [API](/graph/api/resources/samlorwsfedexternaldomainfederation). Make sure that the domain isn't verified in the same tenant. 
      Once the configuration is set up, you can customize the redemption order. The SAML/WS-Fed IdP is added to the redemption order as the last entry. You can move it up in the redemption order to set it above Microsoft Entra identity provider.

      ### Prevent your B2B users from redeeming an invite using Microsoft accounts

      To prevent your B2B guest users from redeeming their invite using their existing Microsoft accounts or creating a new one to accept the invitation, follow the steps below.

      1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/) as at least a [Security Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#security-administrator). Then open the **Identity** service on the left hand side.

      2. Select **External Identities** > **Cross-tenant access settings**.

      3. Under **Organizational settings**, select the link in the **Inbound access** column and the **B2B collaboration** tab.

      4. Select the **Redemption order** tab.

      5. Under **Fallback identity providers** disable Microsoft service account (MSA).

          :::image type="content" source="media/cross-tenant-access-overview/fallback-idp.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the fallback identity providers option." lightbox="media/cross-tenant-access-overview/fallback-idp.png":::

      6. Select **Save**.

      You need to have at least one fallback identity provider enabled at any given time. If you want to disable Microsoft accounts, you have to enable email one-time passcode. You can't disable both fallback identity providers. Any existing guest users signed in with Microsoft accounts continue using it during subsequent sign-ins. You need to [reset their redemption status](reset-redemption-status.md) for this setting to apply.

      ### To change inbound trust settings for MFA and device claims

      1. Select the **Trust settings** tab.

      2. (This step applies to **Organizational settings** only.) If you're configuring settings for an organization, select one of the following:

          - **Default settings**: The organization uses the settings configured on the **Default** settings tab. If customized settings were already configured for this organization, select **Yes** to confirm that you want all settings to be replaced by the default settings. Then select **Save**, and skip the rest of the steps in this procedure.

          - **Customize settings**: You can customize the settings to enforce for this organization instead of the default settings. Continue with the rest of the steps in this procedure.

      3. Select one or more of the following options:

          - **Trust multifactor authentication from Microsoft Entra tenants**: Select this checkbox to allow your Conditional Access policies to trust MFA claims from external organizations. During authentication, Microsoft Entra ID checks a user's credentials for a claim that the user completed MFA. If not, an MFA challenge is initiated in the user's home tenant. This setting isn't applied if an external user signs in using [granular delegated admin privileges (GDAP)](/partner-center/customers/gdap-introduction), such as used by a technician at a Cloud Service Provider that administers services in your tenant. When an external user signs in using GDAP, MFA is always required in the user's home tenant, and always trusted in the resource tenant. MFA registration of a GDAP user isn't supported outside of the user's home tenant. If your organization has a requirement to disallow access to service provider technicians based on MFA in the user's home tenant, you can remove the GDAP relationship in [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home#/partners).

          - **Trust compliant devices**: Allows your Conditional Access policies to trust [compliant device claims](~/identity/conditional-access/policy-alt-all-users-compliant-hybrid-or-mfa.md) from an external organization when their users access your resources.

          - **Trust Microsoft Entra hybrid joined devices**: Allows your Conditional Access policies to trust Microsoft Entra hybrid joined device claims from an external organization when their users access your resources.

      4. (This step applies to **Organizational settings** only.) Review the **Automatic redemption** option:

          - **Automatically redeem invitations with the tenant** &lt;tenant&gt;: Check this setting if you want to automatically redeem invitations. If so, users from the specified tenant won't have to accept the consent prompt the first time they access this tenant using cross-tenant synchronization, B2B collaboration, or B2B direct connect. This setting only suppresses the consent prompt if the specified tenant also checks this setting for outbound access.

          :::image type="content" source="~/media/external-identities/inbound-consent-prompt-setting.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the inbound Automatic redemption check box.":::

      5. Select **Save**.

      ### Allow users to sync into this tenant

      If you select **Inbound access** of the added organization, you see the **Cross-tenant sync** tab and the **Allow users sync into this tenant** check box. Cross-tenant synchronization is a one-way synchronization service in Microsoft Entra ID that automates creating, updating, and deleting B2B collaboration users across tenants in an organization. For more information, see [Configure cross-tenant synchronization](~/identity/multi-tenant-organizations/cross-tenant-synchronization-configure.md) and the [Multitenant organizations documentation](~/identity/multi-tenant-organizations/index.yml).

      ## Modify outbound access settings

      With outbound settings, you select which of your users and groups are able to access the external applications you choose. Whether you're configuring default settings or organization-specific settings, the steps for changing outbound cross-tenant access settings are the same. As described in this section, you navigate to either the **Default** tab or an organization on the **Organizational settings** tab, and then make your changes.

      1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Security Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#security-administrator).

      2. Browse to **Identity** > **External Identities** > **Cross-tenant access settings**.

      3. Navigate to the settings you want to modify:

          - To modify default outbound settings, select the **Default settings** tab, and then under **Outbound access settings**, select **Edit outbound defaults**.

          - To modify settings for a specific organization, select the **Organizational settings** tab, find the organization in the list (or [add one](#add-an-organization)) and then select the link in the **Outbound access** column.

      4. Select the **B2B collaboration** tab.

      5. (This step applies to **Organizational settings** only.) If you're configuring settings for an organization, select an option:

          - **Default settings**: The organization uses the settings configured on the **Default** settings tab. If customized settings were already configured for this organization, you need to select **Yes** to confirm that you want all settings to be replaced by the default settings. Then select **Save**, and skip the rest of the steps in this procedure.

          - **Customize settings**: You can customize the settings to enforce for this organization instead of the default settings. Continue with the rest of the steps in this procedure.

      6. Select **Users and groups**.

      7. Under **Access status**, select one of the following:

          - **Allow access**: Allows your users and groups specified under **Applies to** to be invited to external organizations for B2B collaboration.
          - **Block access**: Blocks your users and groups specified under **Applies to** from being invited to B2B collaboration. If you block access for all users and groups, this also blocks all external applications from being accessed via B2B collaboration.

      8. Under **Applies to**, select one of the following:

          - **All \<your organization\> users**: Applies the action you chose under **Access status** to all your users and groups.
          - **Select \<your organization\> users and groups** (requires a Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 subscription): Lets you apply the action you chose under **Access status** to specific users and groups.

          > [!NOTE]
          > If you block access for all of your users and groups, you also need to block access to all external applications (on the **External applications** tab).

          :::image type="content" source="media/cross-tenant-access-settings-b2b-collaboration/generic-outbound-external-users-groups-target.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing selecting the target users for b2b collaboration.":::

      9. If you chose **Select \<your organization\> users and groups**, do the following for each user or group you want to add:

          - Select **Add \<your organization\> users and groups**.
          - In the **Select** pane, type the user name or group name in the search box.
          - Select the user or group in the search results.
          - When you're done selecting the users and groups you want to add, choose **Select**.

          > [!NOTE]
          > When targeting your users and groups, you won't be able to select users who have configured [SMS-based authentication](~/identity/authentication/howto-authentication-sms-signin.md). This is because users who have a "federated credential" on their user object are blocked to prevent external users from being added to outbound access settings. As a workaround, you can use the [Microsoft Graph API](/graph/api/resources/crosstenantaccesspolicy-overview) to add the user's object ID directly or target a group the user belongs to.

      10. Select the **External applications** tab.

      11. Under **Access status**, select one of the following:

          - **Allow access**: Allows the external applications specified under **Applies to** to be accessed by your users via B2B collaboration.
          - **Block access**: Blocks the external applications specified under **Applies to** from being accessed by your users via B2B collaboration.

      12. Under **Applies to**, select one of the following:

          - **All external applications**: Applies the action you chose under **Access status** to all external applications.
          - **Select external applications**: Applies the action you chose under **Access status** to all external applications.

          > [!NOTE]
          > If you block access to all external applications, you also need to block access for all of your users and groups (on the **Users and groups** tab).

      13. If you chose **Select external applications**, do the following for each application you want to add:

          - Select **Add Microsoft applications** or **Add other applications**.
          - In the search box, type the application name or the application ID (either the *client app ID* or the *resource app ID*). Then select the application in the search results. Repeat for each application you want to add.
          - When you're done selecting applications, choose **Select**.

      14. Select **Save**.

      ### To change outbound trust settings

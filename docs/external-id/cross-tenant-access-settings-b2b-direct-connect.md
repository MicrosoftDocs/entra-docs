# Configure cross-tenant access settings for B2B direct connect

Use cross-tenant access settings to manage how you collaborate with other Microsoft Entra organizations through [B2B direct connect](b2b-direct-connect-overview.md). These settings let you determine the level of outbound access your users have to external organizations. They also let you control the level of inbound access that users in external Microsoft Entra organizations have to your internal resources.

- **Default settings**: The default cross-tenant access settings apply to all external Microsoft Entra organizations, except organizations for which you configure individual settings. You can change these default settings. For B2B direct connect, you typically leave the default settings as-is and enable B2B direct connect access with organization-specific settings. Initially, your default values are as follows:

  - **B2B direct connect initial default settings** - By default, outbound B2B direct connect is blocked for your entire tenant, and inbound B2B direct connect is blocked for all external Microsoft Entra organizations.
  - **Organizational settings** - No organizations are added by default.

- **Organization-specific settings**: You can configure organization-specific settings by adding an organization and modifying the inbound and outbound settings for that organization. Organizational settings take precedence over default settings.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft is beginning to move customers using cross-tenant access settings to a new storage model on August 30, 2023. You may notice an entry in your audit logs informing you that your cross-tenant access settings were updated as our automated task migrates your settings. For a brief window while the migration processes, you will be unable to make changes to your settings. If you are unable to make a change, you should wait a few moments and try the change again. Once the migration completes, [you will no longer be capped with 25kb of storage space](./faq.yml#how-many-organizations-can-i-add-in-cross-tenant-access-settings-) and there will be no more limits on the number of partners you can add.

## Before you begin

- Review the [Important considerations](cross-tenant-access-overview.md#important-considerations) section in the [cross-tenant access overview](cross-tenant-access-overview.md) before configuring your cross-tenant access settings.
- Decide on the default level of access you want to apply to all external Microsoft Entra organizations.
- Identify any Microsoft Entra organizations that need customized settings.
- Contact organizations with which you want to set up B2B direct connect. Because B2B direct connect is established through mutual trust, both you and the other organization need to enable B2B direct connect with each other in your cross-tenant access settings.
- Obtain any required information from external organizations. If you want to apply access settings to specific users, groups, or applications within an external organization, you need to obtain these IDs from the organization before you can configure access settings.
- To configure cross-tenant access settings in the Microsoft Entra admin center, you need an account with a Global Administrator or Security Administrator role. Teams administrators can read cross-tenant access settings, but they can't update these settings.

## Configure default settings

[!INCLUDE [portal updates](~/includes/portal-update.md)]

### To change inbound trust settings for MFA and device state

1. Select the **Trust settings** tab.

1. *If you're configuring settings for an organization*, select one of these options:

   - **Default settings**: The organization uses the settings configured on the **Default** settings tab. If customized settings were already configured for this organization, you need to select **Yes** to confirm that you want all settings to be replaced by the default settings. Then select **Save**, and skip the rest of the steps in this procedure.

   - **Customize settings**: You can customize the settings to enforce for this organization instead of the default settings. Continue with the rest of the steps in this procedure.

1. Select one or more of the following options:

   - **Trust multi-factor authentication from Microsoft Entra tenants**: Select this checkbox if your Conditional Access policies require multifactor authentication (MFA). This setting allows your Conditional Access policies to trust MFA claims from external organizations. During authentication, Microsoft Entra ID checks a user's credentials for a claim that the user completed MFA. If not, an MFA challenge is initiated in the user's home tenant.  

   - **Trust compliant devices**: Allows your Conditional Access policies to trust compliant device claims from an external organization when their users access your resources.

   - **Trust Microsoft Entra hybrid joined devices**: Allows your Conditional Access policies to trust Microsoft Entra hybrid joined device claims from an external organization when their users access your resources.

    ![Screenshot showing inbound trust settings.](media/cross-tenant-access-settings-b2b-direct-connect/inbound-trust-settings.png)

1. (This step applies to **Organizational settings** only.) Review the **Automatic redemption** option:

   - **Automatically redeem invitations with the tenant** &lt;tenant&gt;: Check this setting if you want to automatically redeem invitations. If so, users from the specified tenant won't have to accept the consent prompt the first time they access this tenant using cross-tenant synchronization, B2B collaboration, or B2B direct connect. This setting only suppresses the consent prompt if the specified tenant checks this setting for outbound access as well.

    ![Screenshot that shows the inbound Automatic redemption check box.](~/media/external-identities/inbound-consent-prompt-setting.png)

1. Select **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> When configuring settings for an organization, you'll notice a **Cross-tenant sync** tab. This tab doesn't apply to your B2B direct connect configuration. Instead, this feature is used by multi-tenant organizations to enable B2B collaboration across their tenants. For more information, see the [multi-tenant organization documentation](~/identity/multi-tenant-organizations/index.yml).

## Modify outbound access settings

With outbound settings, you select which of your users and groups are able to access the external applications you choose. The detailed steps for modifying outbound cross-tenant access settings are the same whether you're configuring default or organization-specific settings. As described in this section, navigate to the **Default** tab or an organization on the **Organizational settings** tab, and then make your changes.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Security Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#security-administrator).

1. Browse to **Identity** > **External Identities** > **Cross-tenant access settings**.

1. Navigate to the settings you want to modify:

   - To modify default outbound settings, select the **Default settings** tab, and then under **Outbound access settings**, select **Edit outbound defaults**.

   - To modify settings for a specific organization, select the **Organizational settings** tab, find the organization in the list (or [add one](#add-an-organization)) and then select the link in the **Outbound access** column.

### To change the outbound access settings

1. Select the **B2B direct connect** tab.

1. *If you're configuring settings for an organization,* select one of these options:

   - **Default settings**: The organization uses the settings configured on the **Default** settings tab. If customized settings were already configured for this organization, you need to select **Yes** to confirm that you want all settings to be replaced by the default settings. Then select **Save**, and skip the rest of the steps in this procedure.

   - **Customize settings**: You can customize the settings for this organization, which will be enforced for this organization instead of the default settings. Continue with the rest of the steps in this procedure.

1. Select **Users and groups**.

1. Under **Access status**, select one of the following:

   - **Allow access**: Allows your users and groups specified under **Applies to** to access B2B direct connect.
   - **Block access**: Blocks your users and groups specified under **Applies to** from accessing B2B direct connect. Blocking access for all your users and groups  also blocks all external applications from being shared via B2B direct connect.

    ![Screenshot showing users and groups access status for outbound b2b direct connect](media/cross-tenant-access-settings-b2b-direct-connect/generic-outbound-external-users-groups-access.png)


1. Under **Applies to**, select one of the following:

   - **All \<your organization\> users**: Applies the action you chose under **Access status** to all your users and groups.
   - **Select \<your organization\> users and groups** (requires a Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 subscription): Lets you apply the action you chose under **Access status** to specific users and groups.

   ![Screenshot showing selecting target users for b2b direct connect outbound access](media/cross-tenant-access-settings-b2b-direct-connect/generic-outbound-external-users-groups-target.png)

   - Select **Add \<your organization\> users and groups**.
   - In the **Select** pane, type the user name or the group name in the search box.
   - When you're done selecting users and groups, choose **Select**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > When targeting your users and groups, you won't be able to select users who have configured [SMS-based authentication](~/identity/authentication/howto-authentication-sms-signin.md). This is because users who have a "federated credential" on their user object are blocked to prevent external users from being added to outbound access settings. As a workaround, you can use the [Microsoft Graph API](/graph/api/resources/crosstenantaccesspolicy-overview) to add the user's object ID directly or target a group the user belongs to.

1. Select **Save**.
1. Select the **External applications** tab.
1. Under **Access status**, select one of the following:

   - **Allow access**: Allows the applications specified under **Applies to** to be accessed by B2B direct connect users.
   - **Block access**: Blocks the applications specified under **Applies to** from being accessed by B2B direct connect users.

### To change outbound trust settings

(This section applies to **Organizational settings** only.)

1. Select the **Trust settings** tab.

1. Review the **Automatic redemption** option:

   - **Automatically redeem invitations with the tenant** &lt;tenant&gt;: Check this setting if you want to automatically redeem invitations. If so, users from this tenant don't have to accept the consent prompt the first time they access the specified tenant using cross-tenant synchronization, B2B collaboration, or B2B direct connect. This setting will only suppress the consent prompt if the specified tenant checks this setting for inbound access as well.

    ![Screenshot that shows the outbound Automatic redemption check box.](~/media/external-identities/outbound-consent-prompt-setting.png)

1. Select **Save**.

## Remove an organization

When you remove an organization from your Organizational settings, the default cross-tenant access settings go into effect for that organization.

> [!NOTE]
> If the organization is a cloud service provider for your organization (the isServiceProvider property in the Microsoft Graph [partner-specific configuration](/graph/api/resources/crosstenantaccesspolicyconfigurationpartner) is true), you won't be able to remove the organization.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Security Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#security-administrator).

1. Browse to **Identity** > **External Identities** > **Cross-tenant access settings**.

1. Select the **Organizational settings** tab.

# Federation with SAML/WS-Fed identity providers

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-workforce-external](./includes/applies-to-workforce-external.md)]

Your Microsoft Entra tenant can be directly federated with external organizations that use a SAML or WS-Fed identity provider (IdP). Users from the external organization can then use their IdP-managed account to sign in to your tenant, without having to create new Microsoft Entra credentials. For newly invited users, SAML/WS-Fed IdP federation takes precedence as the primary sign-in method. The user is redirected to their IdP when signing up or signing in to your app, and then returned to Microsoft Entra once they successfully sign in.

You can associate multiple domains with a single federation configuration. The partner's domain can be either Microsoft Entra verified or nonverified.

Setting up SAML/WS-Fed IdP federation requires configuration both in your tenant and in the external organization's IdP. In some cases, the partner needs to update their DNS text records. They also need to update their IdP with the required claims and relying party trusts.

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is currently in preview for external tenants and is generally available for workforce tenants.

## When is a user authenticated with SAML/WS-Fed IdP federation?

After setting up federation, the sign-in experience for the external user depends on your sign-in settings and whether the partner's domain is Microsoft Entra verified.

### Federation with verified and nonverified domains

You can set up SAML/WS-Fed IdP federation with:

- **Nonverified domains**: These domains aren’t DNS-verified in Microsoft Entra ID. For nonverified domains, users from the external organization are authenticated using the federated SAML/WS-Fed IdP.
- **Microsoft Entra ID verified domains**: These domains have been verified within Microsoft Entra ID, including domains where the tenant has undergone an [admin takeover](~/identity/users/domains-admin-takeover.md). For verified domains, Microsoft Entra ID is the primary identity provider used during invitation redemption. For B2B collaboration in a workforce tenant, you can [change the redemption order](cross-tenant-access-overview.md#configurable-redemption) to make the federated IdP the primary method. 

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, redemption order settings aren’t supported in external tenants or across clouds.

### Federation with unmanaged (email-verified) tenants

You can set up SAML/WS-Fed IdP federation with domains that aren't DNS-verified in Microsoft Entra ID, including unmanaged (email-verified or "viral") Microsoft Entra tenants. Such tenants are created when a user redeems a B2B invitation or performs self-service sign-up for Microsoft Entra ID using a domain that doesn’t currently exist.

### How federation affects current external users

Setting up federation doesn't change the authentication method for users who have already redeemed an invitation. For example:

- Users who redeemed invitations before federation setup continue using their original authentication method. For example, users who redeemed invitations with one-time passcode authentication before you set up federation continue using one-time passcodes.
- Users who redeemed invitations with the federated IdP continue using that method, even if their organization later moves to Microsoft Entra.
- Users who are currently using the SAML/WS-Fed IdP are prevented from signing in if federation is deleted.

You don't need to send new invitations to existing users because they continue using their current sign-in method. But for B2B collaboration in a workforce tenant, you can [reset a user's redemption status](reset-redemption-status.md). The next time the user accesses your app, they repeat the redemption steps and switch to federation. Currently, redemption order settings aren't supported in external tenants or across clouds.

### Sign-in endpoints in workforce tenants

When federation is set up in your workforce tenant, users from the federated organization can sign in to your multitenant or Microsoft first-party apps by using a [common endpoint](redemption-experience.md#redemption-process-and-sign-in-through-a-common-endpoint) (in other words, a general app URL that doesn't include your tenant context). During the sign-in process, the user chooses **Sign-in options**, and then selects **Sign in to an organization**. They type the name of your organization and continue signing in using their own credentials.

SAML/WS-Fed IdP federation users can also use application endpoints that include your tenant information, for example:

- `https://myapps.microsoft.com/?tenantid=<your tenant ID>`
- `https://myapps.microsoft.com/<your verified domain>.onmicrosoft.com`
- `https://portal.azure.com/<your tenant ID>`

You can also give users a direct link to an application or resource by including your tenant information, for example `https://myapps.microsoft.com/signin/X/<application ID?tenantId=<your tenant ID>`.

## Considerations for setting up federation

Setting up federation involves configuring both your Microsoft Entra tenant and the external organization's IdP. 

### Partner IdP requirements

Depending on the partner's IdP, the partner might need to update their DNS records to enable federation with you. See [Step 1: Determine if the partner needs to update their DNS text records](#step-1-determine-if-the-partner-needs-to-update-their-dns-text-records).

The Issuer URL in the SAML request sent by Microsoft Entra ID for external federations is now a tenanted endpoint, whereas previously it was a global endpoint. Existing federations with the global endpoint continue to work. But for new federations, set the audience of the external SAML or WS-Fed IdP to a tenanted endpoint. See the [SAML 2.0 section](#required-saml-20-attributes-and-claims) and the [WS-Fed section](#required-ws-fed-attributes-and-claims) for required attributes and claims.

### Signing certificate expiration

If you specify the metadata URL in the IdP settings, Microsoft Entra ID automatically renews the signing certificate when it expires. However, if the certificate is rotated for any reason before the expiration time, or if you don't provide a metadata URL, Microsoft Entra ID is unable to renew it. In this case, you need to update the signing certificate manually.

### Session expiration

If the Microsoft Entra session expires or becomes invalid, and the federated IdP has SSO enabled, the user experiences SSO. If the federated user's session is valid, the user isn't prompted to sign in again. Otherwise, the user is redirected to their IdP for sign-in.

### Other considerations

The following are other considerations when federating with a SAML/WS-Fed identity provider.

- Federation doesn't resolve sign-in issues caused by a partially synced tenancy, where a partner’s on-premises user identities aren't fully synced to Microsoft Entra in the cloud. These users can’t sign in with a B2B invitation, so they need to use the [email one-time passcode](one-time-passcode.md) feature instead. The SAML/WS-Fed IdP federation feature is for partners with their own IdP-managed organizational accounts but no Microsoft Entra presence.

- Federation doesn't replace the need for B2B guest accounts in your directory. With B2B collaboration, a guest account is created for the user in your workforce tenant directory regardless of the authentication or federation method used. This user object allows you to grant access to applications, assign roles, and define membership in security groups.  

- Currently, the Microsoft Entra SAML/WS-Fed federation feature doesn't support sending a signed authentication token to the SAML identity provider.  

## Configure SAML/WS-Fed IdP federation

### Step 1: Determine if the partner needs to update their DNS text records

Use the following steps to determine if the partner needs to update their DNS records to enable federation with you. 

1. Check the partner's IdP passive authentication URL to see if the domain matches the target domain or a host within the target domain. In other words, when setting up federation for `fabrikam.com`:

   - If the passive authentication endpoint is `https://fabrikam.com` or `https://sts.fabrikam.com/adfs` (a host in the same domain), no DNS changes are needed.
   - If the passive authentication endpoint is `https://fabrikamconglomerate.com/adfs` or `https://fabrikam.co.uk/adfs`, the domain doesn't match the fabrikam.com domain, so the partner needs to add a text record for the authentication URL to their DNS configuration.

1. If DNS changes are needed based on the previous step, ask the partner to add a TXT record to their domain's DNS records, like the following example:

   `fabrikam.com.  IN   TXT   DirectFedAuthUrl=https://fabrikamconglomerate.com/adfs`

### Step 2: Configure the partner organization’s IdP

Next, your partner organization needs to configure their IdP with the required claims and relying party trusts.

> [!NOTE]
> To illustrate how to configure a SAML/WS-Fed IdP for federation, we use Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) as an example. See the article [Configure SAML/WS-Fed IdP federation with AD FS](direct-federation-adfs.md), which gives examples of how to configure AD FS as a SAML 2.0 or WS-Fed IdP in preparation for federation.

#### SAML 2.0 configuration

Microsoft Entra B2B can be configured to federate with IdPs that use the SAML protocol with specific requirements listed in this section. For more information about setting up a trust between your SAML IdP and Microsoft Entra ID, see  [Use a SAML 2.0 Identity Provider (IdP) for SSO](~/identity/hybrid/connect/how-to-connect-fed-saml-idp.md).  

> [!NOTE]
> You can now set up SAML/WS-Fed IdP federation with other Microsoft Entra ID verified domains. [Learn more](#federation-with-verified-and-nonverified-domains)

##### Required SAML 2.0 attributes and claims
The following tables show requirements for specific attributes and claims that must be configured at the third-party IdP. To set up federation, the following attributes must be received in the SAML 2.0 response from the IdP. These attributes can be configured by linking to the online security token service XML file or by entering them manually.

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure the value matches the cloud for which you're setting up external federation.

**Table 1. Required attributes for the SAML 2.0 response from the IdP.**

|Attribute  |Value  |
|---------|---------|
|AssertionConsumerService     |`https://login.microsoftonline.com/login.srf`         |
|Audience     |`https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant ID>/` (Recommended) Replace `<tenant ID>` with the tenant ID of the Microsoft Entra tenant you're setting up federation with.<br></br> In the SAML request sent by Microsoft Entra ID for external federations, the Issuer URL is a tenanted endpoint (for example, `https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant ID>/`). For any new federations, we recommend that all our partners set the audience of the SAML or WS-Fed based IdP to a tenanted endpoint. Any existing federations configured with the global endpoint (for example, `urn:federation:MicrosoftOnline`) continue to work, but new federations stop working if your external IdP is expecting a global issuer URL in the SAML request sent by Microsoft Entra ID.|
|Issuer     |The issuer URI of the partner's IdP, for example `http://www.example.com/exk10l6w90DHM0yi...`         |

#### WS-Fed configuration

Microsoft Entra B2B can be configured to federate with IdPs that use the WS-Fed protocol. This section discusses the requirements. Currently, the two WS-Fed providers that have been tested for compatibility with Microsoft Entra ID are AD FS and Shibboleth. For more information about establishing a relying party trust between a WS-Fed compliant provider with Microsoft Entra ID, see the "STS Integration Paper using WS Protocols" available in the [Microsoft Entra identity Provider Compatibility Docs](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=56843).

> [!NOTE]
> You can now set up SAML/WS-Fed IdP federation with other Microsoft Entra ID verified domains. [Learn more](#federation-with-verified-and-nonverified-domains)

##### Required WS-Fed attributes and claims

The following tables show requirements for specific attributes and claims that must be configured at the third-party WS-Fed IdP. To set up federation, the following attributes must be received in the WS-Fed message from the IdP. These attributes can be configured by linking to the online security token service XML file or by entering them manually.

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure the value matches the cloud for which you're setting up external federation.

**Table 3. Required attributes in the WS-Fed message from the IdP.**

### Step 3: Configure SAML/WS-Fed IdP federation in Microsoft Entra External ID

Next, configure federation with the IdP configured in step 1 in Microsoft Entra External ID. You can use either the Microsoft Entra admin center or the [Microsoft Graph API](/graph/api/resources/samlorwsfedexternaldomainfederation?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true). It might take 5-10 minutes before the federation policy takes effect. During this time, don't attempt to redeem an invitation for the federation domain. The following attributes are required:

- Issuer URI of the partner's IdP
- Passive authentication endpoint of partner IdP (only https is supported)
- Certificate

#### To configure federation in the Microsoft Entra admin center


1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least an [External Identity Provider Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#external-identity-provider-administrator).
1. If you have access to multiple tenants, use the **Settings** icon :::image type="icon" source="media/common/admin-center-settings-icon.png" border="false"::: in the top menu and switch to your tenant from the **Directories** menu.
1. Browse to **Identity** > **External Identities** > **All identity providers**.
1. Select the **Custom** tab, and then select **Add new** > **SAML/WS-Fed**.

## Configure redemption order (B2B collaboration in workforce tenants)

If you're configuring federation in your workforce tenant for B2B collaboration with a verified domain, make sure the federated IdP is used first during invitation redemption. [Configure the **Redemption order** settings](cross-tenant-access-settings-b2b-collaboration.yml) in your cross-tenant access settings for inbound B2B collaboration. Move **SAML/WS-Fed identity providers** to the top of the **Primary identity providers** list to prioritize redemption with the federated IdP. For B2B collaboration with a verified domain, make the federated IdP the primary identity provider for invitation redemption. over other identity providers during invitation redemption.  

You can test your federation setup by inviting a new B2B guest user. For details, see [Add Microsoft Entra B2B collaboration users in the Microsoft Entra admin center](add-users-administrator.yml).

> [!NOTE]
> The Microsoft Entra admin center settings for the configurable redemption feature are currently rolling out to customers. Until the settings are available in the admin center, you can configure the invitation redemption order using the Microsoft Graph REST API (beta version). See [Example 2: Update default invitation redemption configuration](/graph/api/crosstenantaccesspolicyconfigurationdefault-update?view=graph-rest-beta&tabs=http#example-2-update-default-invitation-redemption-configuration&preserve-view=true) in the Microsoft Graph reference documentation.
 
## How do I update the certificate or configuration details?

On the **All identity providers** page, you can view the list of SAML/WS-Fed identity providers configured and their certificate expiration dates. From this list, you can renew certificates and modify other configuration details.

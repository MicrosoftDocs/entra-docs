#customer intent: As a developer building an application with B2B collaboration user flows, I want to add a self-service sign-up user flow to my app, so that users can sign up for the app and create a new guest account.

  Add self-service sign-up user flows for B2B collaboration
introduction: |
  [!INCLUDE [applies-to-workforce-only](./includes/applies-to-workforce-only.md)]

  > [!TIP]
  > This article applies to B2B collaboration user flows in workforce tenants. For information about external tenants, see [Create a sign-up and sign-in user flow](customers/how-to-user-flow-sign-up-sign-in-customers.md).

  For applications you build, you can create user flows that allow a user to sign up for an app and create a new guest account. A self-service sign-up user flow defines the series of steps the user follows during sign-up, the [identity providers](identity-providers.md) you allow them to use, and the user attributes you want to collect. You can associate one or more applications with a single user flow.

  > [!NOTE]
  > You can associate user flows with apps built by your organization. User flows can't be used for Microsoft apps, like SharePoint or Teams.
prerequisites:
  summary: |
    Before you begin you may need to add identity providers and define custom attributes.

    ### Add identity providers (optional)

    Microsoft Entra ID is the default identity provider for self-service sign-up. This means that users are able to sign up by default with a Microsoft Entra account. In your self-service sign-up user flows, you can also include social identity providers like Google and Facebook, Microsoft Account, and the email one-time passcode feature. For more information, see these articles:

    - [Add Google to your list of social identity providers](google-federation.md)
    - [Add Facebook to your list of social identity providers](facebook-federation.md)
    - [Add Microsoft account as an identity provider](microsoft-account.md)
    - [Email one-time passcode authentication](one-time-passcode.md)

    ### Define custom attributes (optional)

    User attributes are values collected from the user during self-service sign-up. Microsoft Entra External ID comes with a built-in set of attributes, but you can create custom attributes for use in your user flow. You can also read and write these attributes by using the Microsoft Graph API. See [Define custom attributes for user flows](user-flow-add-custom-attributes.md).

      Enable self-service sign-up for your tenant
    summary: |
      [!INCLUDE [portal updates](~/includes/portal-update.md)]

      Before you can add a self-service sign-up user flow to your applications, you need to enable the feature for your tenant. Then controls become available that let you associate the user flow with an application.

      > [!NOTE]
      > This setting can also be configured with the [authenticationFlowsPolicy](/graph/api/resources/authenticationflowspolicy?view=graph-rest-1.0&preserve-view=true) resource type in the Microsoft Graph API.
    steps: 
      - |
        Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [User Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#user-administrator).
      - |  
        Browse to **Identity** > **External Identities** > **External collaboration settings**.
      - |  
        Set the **Enable guest self-service sign up via user flows** toggle to **Yes**.

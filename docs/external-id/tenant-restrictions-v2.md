> [!NOTE]
> Certain features described in this article are preview features. For more information about previews, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

To enhance security, you can limit what your users can access when they use an external account to sign in from your networks or devices. The *tenant restrictions* settings, included with [cross-tenant access settings](cross-tenant-access-overview.md), let you create a policy to control access to external apps.

For example, suppose a user in your organization created a separate account in an unknown tenant, or an external organization gave your user an account that lets them sign in to their organization. You can use tenant restrictions to prevent the user from using some or all external apps while they're signed in with the external account on your network or devices.

The following diagram shows the steps that an example organization takes to prevent user access by using tenant restrictions v2.

:::image type="content" source="media/tenant-restrictions-v2/authentication-flow.png" alt-text="Diagram that illustrates tenant restrictions v2.":::

| Step  | Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**1**     | Contoso configures tenant restrictions in its cross-tenant access settings to block all external accounts and external apps. Contoso adds enforcement signaling with the tenant restrictions v2 header via either [universal tenant restrictions v2](#option-1-use-universal-tenant-restrictions-v2-as-part-of-microsoft-entra-global-secure-access) or a [corporate proxy](#option-2-set-up-tenant-restrictions-v2-on-your-corporate-proxy). Microsoft Entra ID enforces the tenant restrictions v2 policy when the header is present on the request.      |
|**2**     |  The user of a Contoso-managed device tries to sign in to an external app by using an account from an unknown tenant. The tenant restrictions v2 HTTP header, with Contoso's tenant ID and the policy ID for tenant restrictions, is added to the authentication request.        |
|**3**     | *Authentication plane protection:* Microsoft Entra ID enforces Contoso's tenant restrictions v2 policy and blocks external accounts from accessing external tenants during the authentication.        |
|**4**     | *Data plane protection (preview):* Microsoft Entra ID blocks any anonymous access to Microsoft Forms, SharePoint files, or Microsoft Teams meetings. Microsoft Entra ID also blocks user access to the resource with an infiltrated token.       |
|||

Tenant restrictions v2 provides options for both of these protection types:

- *Authentication plane protection* refers to using a tenant restrictions v2 policy to block sign-ins that use external identities. For example, you can prevent a malicious insider from leaking data over external email by preventing the attacker from signing in to their malicious tenant. Authentication plane protection in tenant restrictions v2 is generally available.

- *Data plane protection* refers to preventing attacks that bypass authentication. For example, an attacker might try to allow access to a malicious tenant's apps by anonymously joining a Teams meeting or anonymously accessing SharePoint files. Or the attacker might copy an access token from a device in a malicious tenant and import it to your organizational device. Data plane protection in tenant restrictions v2 forces the user to authenticate for attempts to access a resource. Data plane protection blocks access if authentication fails.

[Tenant restrictions v1](~/identity/enterprise-apps/tenant-restrictions.md) provides authentication plane protection through a tenant allowlist configured on your corporate proxy. Tenant restrictions v2 gives you options for granular authentication and data plane protection, with or without a corporate proxy. If you're using a corporate proxy for header injection, options include only authentication plane protection.

## Tenant restrictions v2 overview

In your organization's [cross-tenant access settings](cross-tenant-access-overview.md), you can configure a tenant restrictions v2 policy. After you create the policy, there are three ways to apply the policy in your organization:

- **Universal tenant restrictions**. This option provides authentication plane protection without a corporate proxy. [Universal tenant restrictions](/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-universal-tenant-restrictions) use Global Secure Access to tag all traffic no matter the operating system, browser, or device form factor. This option allows support for both client and remote network connectivity.
- **Authentication plane**. You can deploy a corporate proxy in your organization and [configure the proxy to set tenant restrictions v2 signals](#option-2-set-up-tenant-restrictions-v2-on-your-corporate-proxy) on all traffic to Microsoft Entra ID and Microsoft accounts.
- **Windows**. For your corporate-owned Windows devices, you can enforce both authentication plane and data plane protection by enforcing tenant restrictions directly on devices. Tenant restrictions are enforced upon resource access to provide data path coverage and protection against token infiltration. A corporate proxy isn't required for policy enforcement. Devices can be Microsoft Entra ID managed, or they can be domain joined and managed via Group Policy.

> [!NOTE]
> This article describes how to configure tenant restrictions v2 by using the Microsoft Entra admin center. You can also use the [Microsoft Graph API for cross-tenant access settings](/graph/api/resources/crosstenantaccesspolicy-overview?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) to create these same tenant restrictions policies.

### Supported scenarios

You can scope tenant restrictions v2 to specific users, groups, organizations, or external apps. Apps built on the networking stack for the Windows operating system are protected. The following scenarios are supported:

- All Office apps (all versions/release channels)
- Universal Windows Platform (UWP) .NET applications
- Authentication plane protection for all applications that authenticate with Microsoft Entra ID, including all Microsoft applications and any partner applications that use Microsoft Entra ID for authentication
- Data plane protection for SharePoint Online, Exchange Online, and Microsoft Graph
- Anonymous access protection for Forms, SharePoint Online, OneDrive, and Teams (with federation controls configured)
- Authentication and data plane protection for Microsoft tenant or consumer accounts
- When you use universal tenant restrictions in Global Secure Access, all browsers and platforms
- When you use Windows Group Policy, Microsoft Edge and all websites in Microsoft Edge
- Scenarios with device-based authentication (including custom applications integrated with Microsoft Graph)
  
### Unsupported scenarios

- Anonymous blocking to consumer OneDrive accounts. You can work around this limitation at a proxy level by blocking `https://onedrive.live.com/`.
- When a user accesses a partner app, like Slack, by using an anonymous link or non-Microsoft Entra account.
- When a user copies a Microsoft Entra ID-issued token from a home machine to a work machine and uses it to access a third-party app like Slack.
- Per-user tenant restrictions for Microsoft accounts.

## Compare tenant restrictions v1 and v2

The following table compares the features in each version.

| Feature |Tenant restrictions v1  |Tenant restrictions v2  |
|----------------------|---------|---------|
|**Policy enforcement**    | The corporate proxy enforces the tenant restrictions policy on the Microsoft Entra ID control plane.         |     Options: <br></br>- Universal tenant restrictions in Global Secure Access provide authentication plane support on all platforms. <br></br>- In corporate proxy header injection, the corporate proxy sets tenant restrictions v2 signals on all traffic. <br></br>- Windows device management provides both authentication plane and data plane protection. Devices are configured to point Microsoft traffic to the tenant restrictions policy. The policy is enforced in the cloud.     |
|**Policy enforcement limitation**    | You can manage corporate proxies by adding tenants to the Microsoft Entra traffic allowlist. The character limit of the header value in `Restrict-Access-To-Tenants: <allowed-tenant-list>` limits the number of tenants that you can add. |     This feature is managed by a cloud policy in the cross-tenant access policy. A default policy is created at the tenant level, and a partner policy is created for each external tenant.  |
|**Malicious tenant requests** | Microsoft Entra ID blocks malicious tenant authentication requests to provide authentication plane protection.         |    Microsoft Entra ID blocks malicious tenant authentication requests to provide authentication plane protection.     |
|**Granularity**           | This feature is limited to tenants and all Microsoft accounts.        |   This feature includes tenant, user, group, and application granularity. (User-level granularity isn't supported with Microsoft accounts.)      |
|**Anonymous access**      | Anonymous access to Teams meetings and file sharing is allowed.         |   Anonymous access to Teams meetings is blocked. Access to anonymously shared resources (anyone with the link) is blocked. Anonymous access to Forms is blocked.     |
|**Microsoft accounts**          |This feature uses a `Restrict-MSA` header to block access to consumer accounts.         |  This feature allows control of Microsoft account authentication on both the identity and data planes.<br></br>For example, if you enforce tenant restrictions by default, you can create a policy that allows users to access the following specific apps with their Microsoft accounts: <br> Microsoft Learn (app ID `18fbca16-2224-45f6-85b0-f7bf2b39b3f3`) or <br> Microsoft Enterprise Skills Initiative (app ID `195e7f27-02f9-4045-9a91-cd2fa1c2af2f`).       |
|**Proxy management**      | You can manage corporate proxies by adding tenants to the Microsoft Entra traffic allowlist.         |   For authentication plane protection on a corporate proxy, configure the proxy to set tenant restrictions v2 signals on all traffic.      |
|**Platform support**      |This feature is supported on all platforms. It provides only authentication plane protection.        |     Universal tenant restrictions in Global Secure Access support any operating system, browser, or device form factor.<br></br>Authentication plane protection on a corporate proxy supports macOS, Chrome browser, and .NET applications.<br></br>Windows device management supports Windows operating systems and Microsoft Edge.     |
|**Portal support**        |There's no user interface in the Microsoft Entra admin center for configuring the policy.         |   A user interface is available in the Microsoft Entra admin center for setting up the cloud policy.      |
|**Unsupported apps**      |     Not applicable.    |   Block unsupported app use with Microsoft endpoints by using App Control for Business in Windows (formerly Windows Defender Application Control [WDAC]) or Windows Firewall (for example, for Chrome or Firefox). See [Block Chrome, Firefox, and .NET applications like PowerShell](#block-chrome-firefox-and-net-applications-like-powershell) later in this article.      |

## Migrate tenant restrictions v1 policies to v2 on the proxy

Migrating tenant restrictions policies from v1 to v2 is a one-time operation. After migration, no client-side changes are required. You can make any subsequent server-side policy changes via the Microsoft Entra admin center.

When you enable tenant restrictions v2 on a proxy, you can enforce tenant restrictions v2 only on the authentication plane. To enable tenant restrictions v2 on both the authentication and data planes, you should enable client-side signaling for tenant restrictions v2 by using a Windows Group Policy Object (GPO).

### Step 1: Configure an allowed list of partner tenants

Tenant restrictions v1 lets you create an allowlist of tenant IDs and/or Microsoft sign-in endpoints to ensure that users access external tenants that your organization authorizes. Tenant restrictions v1 achieved the allowlist by adding the `Restrict-Access-To-Tenants: <allowed-tenant-list>` header on the proxy. For example: `Restrict-Access-To-Tenants: "contoso.com, fabrikam.com, northwindtraders.com"`. [Learn more about tenant restrictions v1](~/identity/enterprise-apps/tenant-restrictions.md).
  
With tenant restrictions v2, the configuration is moved to the server-side cloud policy. There's no need for the tenant restrictions v1 header, so remove this header from your corporate proxy. For each tenant in the `allowed-tenant-list` header, create a partner tenant policy. Follow these guidelines:
  
- Keep the tenant restrictions v2 default policy that blocks all external tenant access from foreign identities (for example, `user@<externaltenant>.com`).
- Create a partner tenant policy for each tenant listed in your tenant restrictions v1 allowlist by following the steps at [Step 2: Configure tenant restrictions v2 for specific partners](#step-2-configure-tenant-restrictions-v2-for-specific-partners) later in this article.
- Allow only specific users to access specific applications. This design increases your security posture by limiting access to necessary users only.

### Step 2: Block consumer account or Microsoft account tenants

To not allow users to sign in to consumer applications, tenant restrictions v1 needs the `sec-Restrict-Tenant-Access-Policy` header to be injected into traffic visiting login.live.com, like `sec-Restrict-Tenant-Access-Policy: restrict-msa`.

With tenant restrictions v2, the configuration is moved to the server-side cloud policy. There's no need for the tenant restrictions v1 header. On your corporate proxy, remove tenant the restrictions v1 header `sec-Restrict-Tenant-Access-Policy: restrict-msa`.

Create a partner tenant policy for the Microsoft account tenant by following [Step 2: Configure tenant restrictions v2 for specific partners](#step-2-configure-tenant-restrictions-v2-for-specific-partners) later in this article. Because user-level assignment isn't available for Microsoft account tenants, the policy applies to all users of Microsoft accounts. However, application-level granularity is available. You should limit the applications that Microsoft accounts or consumer accounts can access to only necessary applications.

> [!NOTE]
> Blocking the Microsoft account tenant doesn't block device traffic from sources other than users, including:
>
>- Traffic for Autopilot, Windows Update, and organizational data collection.
>- Business-to-business (B2B) authentication of consumer accounts, or passthrough authentication, where Azure apps and Office.com apps use Microsoft Entra ID to sign in consumer users in a consumer context.

### Step 3: Enable tenant restrictions v2 on the corporate proxy

You can configure the corporate proxy to enable client-side tagging of the tenant restrictions v2 header by using the following corporate proxy setting: `sec-Restrict-Tenant-Access-Policy: <DirectoryID>:<policyGUID>`.

In that setting, replace `<DirectoryID>` with your Microsoft Entra tenant ID. Replace `<policyGUID>` with the object ID for your cross-tenant access policy.

## Tenant restrictions vs. inbound and outbound settings

Although tenant restrictions are configured along with your cross-tenant access settings, they operate separately from inbound and outbound access settings. Cross-tenant access settings give you control when users sign in with an account from your organization. By contrast, tenant restrictions give you control when users are using an external account. Your inbound and outbound settings for B2B collaboration and B2B direct connections don't affect (and are unaffected by) your tenant restrictions settings.

Think of the access settings this way:

- Inbound settings control *external* account access to your *internal* apps.
- Outbound settings control *internal* account access to *external* apps.
- Tenant restrictions control *external* account access to *external* apps.

## Tenant restrictions vs. B2B collaboration

When your users need access to external organizations and apps, we recommend that you enable tenant restrictions to block external accounts and use B2B collaboration instead. B2B collaboration gives you the ability to:

- Use Conditional Access and force multifactor authentication for B2B collaboration users.
- Manage inbound and outbound access.
- Terminate sessions and credentials when a B2B collaboration user's employment status changes or their credentials are breached.
- Use sign-in logs to view details about B2B collaboration users.

## Prerequisites

To configure tenant restrictions, you need:

- Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2.
- An account with a role of at least Security Administrator to configure a tenant restrictions v2 policy.
- For Windows GPO configuration, Windows devices running Windows 10 or Windows 11 with the latest updates.

## Configure a server-side cloud policy for tenant restrictions v2

### Step 1: Configure default tenant restrictions

Settings for tenant restrictions v2 are located in the Microsoft Entra admin center, under **Cross-tenant access settings**. First, configure the default tenant restrictions that you want to apply to all users, groups, apps, and organizations. If you need partner-specific configurations, you can add a partner's organization and customize any settings that differ from your defaults.

To configure default tenant restrictions:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Security Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#security-administrator).

1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **External Identities** > **Cross-tenant access settings**.

1. Select the **Default settings** tab.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tenant-restrictions-v2/tenant-restrictions-default-section.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the tenant restrictions section on the tab for default settings.":::

1. Scroll to the **Tenant restrictions** section.

1. Select the **Edit tenant restrictions defaults** link.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tenant-restrictions-v2/tenant-restrictions-default-section-edit.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the link for editing default settings for tenant restrictions.":::

1. If a default policy doesn't exist yet in the tenant, a **Create policy** link appears next to **Policy ID**. Select this link.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tenant-restrictions-v2/create-tenant-restrictions-policy.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the link for creating a policy.":::

1. The **Tenant restrictions** pane displays both your **Tenant ID** value and your **Policy ID** value for tenant restrictions. Use the copy icons to copy both of these values. You'll use them later when you configure Windows clients to enable tenant restrictions.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tenant-restrictions-v2/tenant-policy-id.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the tenant ID and policy ID for tenant restrictions.":::

1. Select the **External users and groups** tab. Under **Access status**, choose one of the following options:

   - **Allow access**: Allows all users who are signed in with external accounts to access external apps (specified on the **External applications** tab).
   - **Block access**: Blocks all users who are signed in with external accounts from accessing external apps (specified on the **External applications** tab).

   :::image type="content" source="media/tenant-restrictions-v2/tenant-restrictions-default-external-users-block.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows settings for access status on the tab for external users and groups.":::

   > [!NOTE]
   > Default settings can't be scoped to individual accounts or groups, so **Applies to** always equals **All &lt;your tenant&gt; users and groups**. Be aware that if you block access for all users and groups, you also need to block access to all external applications (on the **External applications** tab).

1. Select the **External applications** tab. Under **Access status**, choose one of the following options:

   - **Allow access**: Allows all users who are signed in with external accounts to access the apps specified in the **Applies to** section.
   - **Block access**: Blocks all users who are signed in with external accounts from accessing the apps specified in the **Applies to** section.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tenant-restrictions-v2/tenant-restrictions-default-applications.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows options for access status on the tab for external applications.":::

1. Under **Applies to**, select one of the following options:

   - **All external applications**: Applies the action that you chose under **Access status** to all external applications. If you block access to all external applications, you also need to block access for all of your users and groups (on the **External users and groups** tab).
   - **Select external applications**: Lets you choose the external applications that you want the action under **Access status** to apply to.

     To select applications, choose **Add Microsoft applications** or **Add other applications**. Then search by the application name or the application ID (either the *client app ID* or the *resource app ID*), and select the app. ([See a list of IDs for commonly used Microsoft applications.](/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/verify-first-party-apps-sign-in)) If you want to add more apps, use the **Add** button. When you finish, select **Submit**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tenant-restrictions-v2/tenant-restrictions-default-applications-applies-to.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the tab for external applications.":::

1. Select **Save**.

### Step 2: Configure tenant restrictions v2 for specific partners

Suppose you use tenant restrictions to block access by default, but you want to allow users to access certain applications by using their own external accounts. For example, you want users to be able to access Microsoft Learn with their own Microsoft accounts. The instructions in this section describe how to add organization-specific settings that take precedence over the default settings.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Security Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#security-administrator) or a [Conditional Access Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#conditional-access-administrator).

1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **External Identities** > **Cross-tenant access settings**.

1. Select  **Organizational settings**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If the organization that you want to add was already added to the list, you can skip adding it and go directly to modifying the settings.

1. Select **Add organization**.

1. On the **Add organization** pane, enter the full domain name (or tenant ID) for the organization.

   For example, search for the following tenant ID for a Microsoft account:

   ```
   9188040d-6c67-4c5b-b112-36a304b66dad
   ```

   :::image type="content" source="media/tenant-restrictions-v2/add-organization-microsoft-accounts.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows adding an organization.":::

1. Select the organization in the search results, and then select **Add**.

1. Modify the settings. Find the organization in the **Organizational settings** list, and then scroll horizontally to see the **Tenant restrictions** column. At this point, all tenant restrictions settings for this organization are inherited from your default settings. To change the settings for this organization, select the **Inherited from default** link.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tenant-restrictions-v2/tenant-restrictions-edit-link.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows an organization added with default settings.":::

1. The **Tenant restrictions** pane for the organization appears. Copy the values for **Tenant ID** and **Policy ID**. You'll use them later when you configure Windows clients to enable tenant restrictions.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tenant-restrictions-v2/org-tenant-policy-id.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a tenant ID and policy ID.":::

1. Select **Customize settings**, and then select the **External users and groups** tab. Under **Access status**, choose an option:

   - **Allow access**: Allows users and groups specified under **Applies to** who are signed in with external accounts to access external apps (specified on the **External applications** tab).
   - **Block access**: Blocks users and groups specified under **Applies to** who are signed in with external accounts from accessing external apps (specified on the **External applications** tab).

   For the Microsoft accounts example in this article, we select **Allow access**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tenant-restrictions-v2/tenant-restrictions-external-users-organizational.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows selecting the option to allow access for external users.":::

## Configure tenant restrictions v2 on the client side

There are three options for enforcing tenant restrictions v2 for clients:

- [Use universal tenant restrictions v2 as part of Microsoft Entra Global Secure Access](#option-1-use-universal-tenant-restrictions-v2-as-part-of-microsoft-entra-global-secure-access)
- [Set up tenant restrictions v2 on your corporate proxy](#option-2-set-up-tenant-restrictions-v2-on-your-corporate-proxy)
- [Enable tenant restrictions on Windows-managed devices (preview)](#option-3-enable-tenant-restrictions-on-windows-managed-devices-preview)

### Option 1: Use universal tenant restrictions v2 as part of Microsoft Entra Global Secure Access

Universal tenant restrictions v2 as part of [Microsoft Entra Global Secure Access](/entra/global-secure-access/overview-what-is-global-secure-access) provides authentication plane protection for all devices and platforms.

### Option 2: Set up tenant restrictions v2 on your corporate proxy

To ensure that sign-ins are restricted on all devices and apps in your corporate network, configure your corporate proxy to enforce tenant restrictions v2. Although configuring tenant restrictions on your corporate proxy doesn't provide data plane protection, it does provide authentication plane protection.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you previously set up tenant restrictions, you need to stop sending `restrict-msa` to login.live.com. Otherwise, the new settings will conflict with your existing instructions to the Microsoft account's sign-in service.

1. Configure the tenant restrictions v2 header as follows:

   |Header name  |Header value  | Sample value |
   |---------|---------|-----------------|
   |`sec-Restrict-Tenant-Access-Policy`     |  `<TenantId>:<policyGuid>`       | `aaaabbbb-0000-cccc-1111-dddd2222eeee:1aaaaaa1-2bb2-3cc3-4dd4-5eeeeeeeeee5`|

   - `TenantID` is your Microsoft Entra tenant ID. Find this value by signing in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) and browsing to **Entra ID** > **Overview** > **Properties**.
   - `policyGUID` is the object ID for your cross-tenant access policy. Find this value by calling `/crosstenantaccesspolicy/default` and using the returned `id` field.

1. On your corporate proxy, send the tenant restrictions v2 header to the following Microsoft sign-in domains:

   - login.live.com
   - login.microsoft.com
   - login.microsoftonline.com
   - login.windows.net

   This header enforces your tenant restrictions v2 policy on all sign-ins on your network. This header doesn't block anonymous access to Teams meetings, SharePoint files, or other resources that don't require authentication.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Tenant restrictions v1 and v2 on the proxy require decryption of requests to sign-in URLs such as login.microsoftonline.com. Microsoft supports the decryption of traffic for those sign-in domains for the purpose of header insertion for tenant restrictions. This decryption is a valid exception to the policies at [Use third-party network devices or solutions with Microsoft 365](/microsoft-365/troubleshoot/miscellaneous/office-365-third-party-network-devices).

#### Tenant restrictions v2 with no support for break and inspect

For non-Windows platforms, you can break and inspect traffic to add the tenant restrictions v2 parameters into the header via proxy. However, some platforms don't support break and inspect, so tenant restrictions v2 doesn't work. For these platforms, the following features of Microsoft Entra ID can provide protection:

- [Conditional Access: Allow use of only managed or compliant devices](/mem/intune/protect/conditional-access-intune-common-ways-use#device-based-conditional-access)

### Option 3: Enable tenant restrictions on Windows-managed devices (preview)

After you create a tenant restrictions v2 policy, you can enforce the policy on each Windows 10 or Windows 11 device by adding your tenant ID and the policy ID to the device's **Tenant restrictions** configuration.

When you enable tenant restrictions on a Windows device, corporate proxies aren't required for policy enforcement. Devices don't need to be Microsoft Entra ID managed to enforce tenant restrictions v2. Domain-joined devices that are managed with Group Policy are also supported.

> [!NOTE]
> Tenant restrictions v2 on Windows is a partial solution that helps protect the authentication and data planes for some scenarios. It works on managed Windows devices. It doesn't protect the .NET stack, Chrome, or Firefox.

#### Use Group Policy to deploy tenant restrictions

You can use Group Policy to deploy the tenant restrictions configuration to Windows devices. Refer to these resources:

- [Administrative Templates for Windows 10 November 2021 Update (21H2)](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=104042)
- [Group Policy Settings Reference Spreadsheet for Windows 10 November 2021 Update (21H2)](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=104043)

#### Test the policy on a device

To test the tenant restrictions v2 policy on a device, follow these steps.

> [!NOTE]
> The device must be running Windows 10 or Windows 11 with the latest updates.

1. On the Windows computer, select the Windows logo key, enter **gpedit**, and then select **Edit group policy (Control panel)**.

1. Go to **Computer Configuration** > **Administrative Templates** > **Windows Components** > **Tenant Restrictions**.

1. Right-click **Cloud Policy Details** on the right pane, and then select **Edit**.

1. Retrieve the **Tenant ID** and **Policy ID** values that you recorded earlier (in step 7 under [Step 1: Configure default tenant restrictions](#step-1-configure-default-tenant-restrictions)) and enter them in the following fields. Leave all other fields blank.

   - **Microsoft Entra Directory ID**: Enter the **Tenant ID** value that you recorded earlier by signing in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) and browsing to **Entra ID** > **Overview** > **Properties**.
   - **Policy GUID**: The ID for your cross-tenant access policy. It's the **Policy ID** value that you recorded earlier.

     :::image type="content" source="media/tenant-restrictions-v2/windows-cloud-policy-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Cloud Policy Details for Windows.":::

1. Select **OK**.

#### View tenant restrictions v2 events

View events related to tenant restrictions in Event Viewer:

1. In Event Viewer, open **Applications and Services Logs**.
1. Go to **Microsoft** > **Windows** > **TenantRestrictions** > **Operational** and look for events.

## Block Chrome, Firefox, and .NET applications like PowerShell

To block applications, you need to set up App Control for Business in Windows (formerly Windows Defender Application Control [WDAC]) and enable a Windows Firewall setting.

### Set up App Control for Business to control access to Microsoft resources

App Control for Business is a policy engine built into Windows that allows you to control which applications can run on your user's devices. For tenant restrictions v2, you need to use App Control for Business to block *unenlightened apps* (apps that don't provide tenant restrictions v2 protection) from accessing Microsoft resources.  This requirement allows you to keep using the browsers and apps of your choice, while knowing that data protected by Microsoft Entra can be accessed only through secure means.  

Unenlightened apps don't use the Windows networking stack, so they don't benefit from the tenant restrictions v2 features added to Windows. They can't send the signal to login.live.com for Microsoft Entra, or to Microsoft resources that indicate that tenant restrictions v2 protection is required. As such, you can't rely on unenlightened apps to provide data plane protection.  

You can use App Control for Business in two ways to help protect against unenlightened apps:

- Prevent the use of unenlightened apps entirely (that is, block PowerShell or Chrome entirely from running). You can use a standard App Control for Business policy that controls which apps can run.  
- Allow the use of unenlightened apps, but block them from accessing Microsoft resources. For this method, you use a special App Control for Business policy called an *app ID tagging policy* (`AppIdTaggingPolicy`).

For both options, you must first create an App Control for Business policy. Then, optionally, convert it to an app ID tagging policy. Finally, apply it to your devices after testing it on a test machine.

For more information, see [Creating your App Control AppId tagging policies](/windows/security/application-security/application-control/app-control-for-business/appidtagging/design-create-appid-tagging-policies).

> [!NOTE]
> The following steps require an up-to-date Windows device for access to the latest PowerShell cmdlets needed to create the policy.  

#### Step 1: Use the App Control Policy Wizard to create a policy

1. Install the [App Control Policy Wizard](/windows/security/application-security/application-control/app-control-for-business/design/appcontrol-wizard).

1. Select **Create a policy** and choose your policy format. The default is **Multiple policy, base policy**.

1. Choose your base template (recommended: **Default Windows** or **Allow Microsoft**). For detailed steps, see [Template base policies](/windows/security/application-security/application-control/app-control-for-business/design/appcontrol-wizard-create-base-policy#template-base-policies).

1. When you convert the policy into an app ID tagging policy, the wizard assumes that policy rules are set. You can set them here, but it's not required. These policy rules include **Advanced Boot Options Menu**, **Disable Script Enforcement**, **Enforce Store Applications**, **Audit Mode**, and **User Mode Code Integrity**.

1. Choose the save location of your policy XML and create your policy.

#### Step 2: Convert the policy into an app ID tagging policy

After you create your policy in the wizard, or create your own by using PowerShell, convert the .xml output to an app ID tagging policy. The tagging policy marks the apps for which you want to allow access to Microsoft resources. The GUID output is your new policy ID.

```powershell
   Set-CIPolicyIdInfo -ResetPolicyID .\policy.xml -AppIdTaggingPolicy -AppIdTaggingKey "M365ResourceAccessEnforced" -AppIdTaggingValue "True" 
```

#### Step 3: Compile and deploy the policy for testing

After you edit the policy and convert it to an app ID tagging policy, compile it with the policy ID that matches the file name:

```powershell
   ConvertFrom-CIPolicy .\policy.xml ".\{PolicyID}.cip"
```

Then deploy the policy to your `CiPolicies\Active` directory:

```powershell
   copy ".\{Policy ID}.cip" c:\windows\system32\codeintegrity\CiPolicies\Active\ 
```

Refresh the policies on your system by calling [RefreshPolicy.exe](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=102925).

### Enable the Windows Firewall setting

You can use the Windows Firewall feature to block unprotected apps from accessing Microsoft resources via Chrome, Firefox, and .NET applications like PowerShell. These applications would be blocked or allowed in accordance with the tenant restrictions v2 policy.

For example, if you add PowerShell to your Customer Identification Program (CIP) policy for tenant restrictions v2, and you have graph.microsoft.com in your tenant restrictions v2 policy's endpoint list, PowerShell should be able to access it with the firewall enabled.

1. On the Windows computer, select the Windows logo key, enter **gpedit**, and then select **Edit group policy (Control panel)**.

1. Go to **Computer Configuration** > **Administrative Templates** > **Windows Components** > **Tenant Restrictions**.

1. Right-click **Cloud Policy Details** on the right pane, and then select **Edit**.

1. Select the **Enable firewall protection of Microsoft endpoints** checkbox, and then select **OK**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tenant-restrictions-v2/cloud-policy-block.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the option to enable a firewall policy.":::

1. Refresh Group Policy on your device by running `gpudate`:

   ```powershell
      gupdate /force
   ```

1. Restart the device.

### Test that tenant restrictions v2 blocks access

After you enable the firewall and the App Control for Business setting, try signing in by using a Chrome browser and access office.com. Sign-in should fail with the following message.

:::image type="content" source="media/tenant-restrictions-v2/end-user-access-blocked.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a message that says internet access is blocked.":::

## Tenant restrictions and data plane support (preview)

The following resources enforce tenant restrictions v2. These resources address token infiltration scenarios where a bad actor accesses the resource directly with an infiltrated token or anonymously.

- Teams
- SharePoint Online, like a OneDrive app
- Exchange Online, like an Outlook app
- Office.com and Office apps

## Tenant restrictions and Microsoft Forms (preview)

When tenant restrictions v2 is enforced, it automatically blocks all anonymous or unauthenticated identity access to externally hosted forms from Microsoft Forms.

## Tenant restrictions and Microsoft Teams (preview)

Teams, by default, has open federation. It doesn't block anyone from joining a meeting that an external tenant hosts. For greater control over access to Teams meetings, you can use [federation controls](/microsoftteams/trusted-organizations-external-meetings-chat) in Teams to allow or block specific tenants. You can also use these federation controls along with tenant restrictions v2 to block anonymous access to Teams meetings.

To enforce tenant restrictions for Teams, you need to configure tenant restrictions v2 in your Microsoft Entra cross-tenant access settings. You also need to set up federation controls in the Teams admin portal and restart Teams. Tenant restrictions v2 implemented on the corporate proxy doesn't block anonymous access to Teams meetings, SharePoint files, and other resources that don't require authentication.

If you're considering using tenant restrictions for Teams, keep the following points about identity in mind:

- Teams currently allows users to join *any* externally hosted meeting by using their corporate-provided or home-provided identity. You can use outbound cross-tenant access settings to control which users with a corporate-provided or home-provided identity can join externally hosted Teams meetings.
- Tenant restrictions prevent users from using an externally issued identity to join Teams meetings.

> [!NOTE]
> The Microsoft Teams app has a dependency on SharePoint Online and Exchange Online apps. We recommend setting the tenant restrictions v2 policy on the Office 365 app instead of setting the policy on Microsoft Teams services, SharePoint Online, or Exchange Online separately. If you allow or block one of the applications (SharePoint Online, Exchange Online, and so on) that are part of Office 365, it will also affect apps like Microsoft Teams. Similarly, if the Microsoft Teams app is allowed or blocked, SharePoint Online and Exchange Online within the Teams app will be affected.

### Pure anonymous meeting join

Tenant restrictions v2 automatically blocks all unauthenticated and externally issued identity access to externally hosted Teams meetings.

For example, suppose Contoso uses Teams federation controls to block the Fabrikam tenant. If someone with a Contoso device uses a Fabrikam account to join a Contoso Teams meeting, they're allowed into the meeting as an anonymous user. If Contoso also enables tenant restrictions v2, Teams blocks anonymous access, and the user can't join the meeting.

### Meeting join through an externally issued identity

You can configure the tenant restrictions v2 policy to allow specific users or groups with externally issued identities to join specific externally hosted Teams meetings. With this configuration, users can sign in to Teams with their externally issued identities and join the specified tenant's externally hosted Teams meetings.

| Authentication identity | Authenticated session  | Result |
|----------------------|---------|---------|
|Tenant member user<br></br> Example: A user uses their home identity as a member user (such as `user@<mytenant>.com`). | Authenticated |  Tenant restrictions v2 allows access to the Teams meeting. Tenant restrictions v2 isn't applied to tenant member users. The inbound/outbound policy for cross-tenant access applies.  |
|Anonymous <br></br> Example: A user tries to use an unauthenticated session in an InPrivate browser window to access a Teams meeting. | Not authenticated |  Tenant restrictions v2 blocks access to the Teams meeting.  |
|Externally issued identity<br></br> Example: A user uses any identity other than their home identity (such as `user@<externaltenant>.com`). | Authenticated as an externally issued identity |  The tenant restrictions v2 policy allows or blocks access to the Teams meeting. The user can join the meeting if the policy allows it. Otherwise, access is blocked. |

## Tenant restrictions v2 and SharePoint Online (preview)

SharePoint Online supports tenant restrictions v2 on both the authentication plane and the data plane.

### Authenticated sessions

When tenant restrictions v2 is enabled on a tenant, unauthorized access is blocked during authentication. If a user directly accesses a SharePoint Online resource without an authenticated session, they're prompted to sign in. If the tenant restrictions v2 policy allows access, the user can access the resource. Otherwise, access is blocked.

### Anonymous access (preview)

If a user tries to access an anonymous file by using their home tenant or corporate identity, the user can access the file. But if the user tries to access the anonymous file by using any externally issued identity, access is blocked.

For example, assume that a user is using a managed device configured with tenant restrictions v2 for Tenant A. If the user selects an anonymous access link generated for a Tenant A resource, they should be able to access the resource anonymously. But if the user selects an anonymous access link generated for SharePoint Online in Tenant B, they're prompted to sign in. Anonymous access to resources through an externally issued identity is always blocked.

## Tenant restrictions v2 and OneDrive (preview)

### Authenticated sessions

When tenant restrictions v2 is enabled on a tenant, unauthorized access is blocked during authentication. If a user directly accesses a OneDrive resource without an authenticated session, they're prompted to sign in. If the tenant restrictions v2 policy allows access, the user can access the resource. Otherwise, access is blocked.

### Anonymous access (preview)

Like SharePoint, OneDrive supports tenant restrictions v2 on both the authentication plane and the data plane. Blocking anonymous access to OneDrive is also supported. For example, enforcement of the tenant restrictions v2 policy works at the OneDrive endpoint (microsoft-my.sharepoint.com).

### Not in scope

OneDrive for consumer accounts (via onedrive.live.com) doesn't support tenant restrictions v2. Some URLs (such as onedrive.live.com) are unconverged and use the legacy stack. When a user accesses the OneDrive consumer tenant through these URLs, the policy isn't enforced. As a workaround, you can block `https://onedrive.live.com/` at the proxy level.

## Tenant restrictions v2 and service principals

Tenant restrictions v2 blocks access from a service principal. You can enable client signaling by using:

- A firewall or corporate proxy. Sign in by using the service principal:

  ```powershell
      $client_id = "00001111-aaaa-2222-bbbb-3333cccc4444"
      $clientSecret = Get-Credential -Username $client_id
      Connect-MgGraph -TenantId "aaaabbbb-0000-cccc-1111-dddd2222eeee" -ClientSecretCredential $clientSecret
  ```

  The sign-in fails with:

  `Connect-MgGraph : ClientSecretCredential authentication failed: AADSTS5000211: A tenant restrictions policy added to this request by a device or network administrator does not allow access to 'tenant'.`

- A Windows GPO. You need to check **Enable firewall protection of Microsoft endpoints** and App Control for Business enablement. See [Block Chrome, Firefox, and .NET applications like PowerShell](#block-chrome-firefox-and-net-applications-like-powershell) earlier in this article.

## Tenant restrictions with the Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in for Apple devices

The Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in for Apple devices provides single sign-on (SSO) for Microsoft Entra accounts on macOS, iOS, and iPadOS across all applications that support Apple's Enterprise SSO feature. To use the Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in for Apple devices, you need to exclude certain URLs from network proxies, interception, and other enterprise systems.

If your organization uses Apple OS versions released after 2022, there's no need to exclude Microsoft sign-in URLs from TLS inspection. If you're using the tenant restrictions feature, you can do TLS inspection on Microsoft sign-in URLs and add the necessary headers on the request. For more information, see [Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in for Apple devices](/entra/identity-platform/apple-sso-plugin#requirements).

You can [validate the networking configuration on a macOS device](/entra/identity/devices/troubleshoot-mac-sso-extension-plugin?tabs=flowchart-ios#validate-networking-configuration-on-macos-device) to make sure that SSO configuration isn't broken due to TLS inspection.

## Sign-in logs

Microsoft Entra sign-in logs let you view details about sign-ins with a tenant restrictions v2 policy in place. When a B2B user signs in to a resource tenant to collaborate, a sign-in log is generated in both the home tenant and the resource tenant. These logs include information such as the application being used, email addresses, tenant name, and tenant ID for both the home tenant and the resource tenant. The following example shows a successful sign-in.

:::image type="content" source="media/tenant-restrictions-v2/sign-in-details-success.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows activity details for a successful sign-in." lightbox="media/tenant-restrictions-v2/sign-in-details-success-large.png":::

If sign-in fails, the activity details give information about the reason for the failure.

:::image type="content" source="media/tenant-restrictions-v2/sign-in-details-failure.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows activity details for a failed sign-in." lightbox="media/tenant-restrictions-v2/sign-in-details-failure-large.png":::

## Audit logs

Audit logs provide records of system and user activities, including activities that guest users initiated. You can view audit logs for the tenant under **Monitoring**, or you can view audit logs for a specific user by going to the user's profile.

:::image type="content" source="media/tenant-restrictions-v2/audit-logs.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the page for audit logs.":::

To get more details about the event, select the event in the log.

## Known limitations

Tenant restrictions v2 is supported on all clouds. However, tenant restrictions v2 is not enforced with cross-cloud requests.

Tenant restrictions v2 doesn't work with the [macOS Platform SSO](~/identity/devices/troubleshoot-macos-platform-single-sign-on-extension.md) feature with client signaling via corporate proxy. Customers who use tenant restrictions v2 and Platform SSO should use universal tenant restrictions v2 with Global Secure Access client signaling. This is an Apple limitation in which Platform SSO is not compatible with tenant restrictions when an intermediary network solution injects headers. An example of such a solution is a proxy that uses a certificate trust chain outside Apple system root certificates.

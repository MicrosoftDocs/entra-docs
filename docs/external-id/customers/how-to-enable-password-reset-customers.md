# Enable self-service password reset

Self-service password reset (SSPR) in Microsoft Entra External ID gives customers the ability to change or reset their password, with no administrator or help desk involvement. If a customer's account is locked or they forget their password, they can follow prompts to unblock themselves and get back to work.

## How does the password reset process work?

The self-service password uses the email one-time passcode (Email OTP) authentication. When enabled, customer users who forgot their passwords use Email OTP authentication. With one-time passcode authentication, users verify their identity by entering the one-time passcode sent to their email address, and are then prompted to change their password.

The following screenshots show the self-service password rest flow. From the app, the customer chooses to sign-in. On the sign-in page, the user types their email and selects **Next**. If users forgot their password, they choose the **Forgot password?** option. Microsoft Entra ID sends the passcode to email address provided on the first page. The customer needs to type the passcode to continue.

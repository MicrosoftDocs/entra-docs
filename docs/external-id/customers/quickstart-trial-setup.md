# Quickstart: Get started with Microsoft Entra External ID for external-facing apps (preview)

Get started with Microsoft Entra External ID for external-facing apps (Preview), which lets you create secure, customized sign-in experiences for your customer-facing apps and services. With these built-in external configuration features, Microsoft Entra External ID can serve as the identity provider and access management service for your customers.

In this quickstart, you'll learn how to set up an external tenant free trial. If you're a developer using Visual Studio Code, you can also set up a free trial through the Microsoft Entra External ID extension ([learn more](visual-studio-code-extension.md)). If you already have an Azure subscription, you can create a tenant with external configurations in the Microsoft Entra admin center. For more information about how to create a tenant, see [Set up a tenant](quickstart-tenant-setup.md).

Your free trial of a tenant with external configurations provides you with the opportunity to try new features and build applications and processes during the free trial period. Organization (tenant) admins can invite other users. Each user account can only have one active free trial tenant at a time. The free trial isn't designed for scale testing. Trial tenant will support up to 10K resources, learn more about Microsoft Entra service limits [here](~/identity/users/directory-service-limits-restrictions.md). During your free trial, you'll have the option to unlock the full set of features by upgrading to [Azure free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

   > [!NOTE]
   > At the end of the free trial period, your free trial tenant will be disabled and deleted. You can always come back and register for another trial using this link: https://aka.ms/ciam-free-trial. 
    
During the free trial period, you'll have access to all product features with few exceptions. See the following table for comparison:

# Tutorial: Prepare your external tenant to authenticate users in an ASP.NET Core web app

This tutorial series demonstrates how to build an ASP.NET Core web application and prepare it for authentication using the Microsoft Entra admin center. You'll use the [Microsoft Authentication Library for .NET](/entra/msal/dotnet/) and [Microsoft Identity Web](/dotnet/api/microsoft-authentication-library-dotnet/confidentialclient) libraries to authenticate your app with your external tenant. Finally, you'll run the application and test the sign-in and sign-out experiences.

In this tutorial, you'll;

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Register a web application in the Microsoft Entra admin center, and record its identifiers
> - Create a client secret for the web application
> - Define the platform and URLs
> - Grant permissions to the web application to access the Microsoft Graph API
> - Create a sign in and sign out user flow in the Microsoft Entra admin center
> - Associate your web application with the user flow

## Prerequisites

- An external tenant. If you don't have one, [create a trial tenant](https://aka.ms/ciam-free-trial) or a [tenant with a subscription](./quickstart-tenant-setup.md) before you begin.
- This Azure account must have permissions to manage applications. Any of the following Microsoft Entra roles include the required permissions:
    - Application Administrator
    - Application Developer
    - Cloud Application Administrator

## Register the web app and record identifiers

[!INCLUDE [ciam-register-app](./includes/register-app/register-client-app-common.md)]

## Add a platform redirect URL

[!INCLUDE [ciam-register-app](./includes/register-app/add-platform-redirect-url-dotnet.md)]

## Add app client secret

[!INCLUDE [ciam-add-client-secret](./includes/register-app/add-app-client-secret.md)]

## Grant API permissions

[!INCLUDE [ciam-grant-delegated-permissions](./includes/register-app/grant-api-permission-sign-in.md)]

## Create a user flow

[!INCLUDE [ciam-app-integration-add-user-flow](./includes/configure-user-flow/create-sign-in-sign-out-user-flow.md)]

## Associate the web application with the user flow

[!INCLUDE [ciam-app-integration-add-user-flow](./includes/configure-user-flow/add-app-user-flow.md)]

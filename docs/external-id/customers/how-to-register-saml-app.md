# Register a SAML app in your external tenant (preview)

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-external-only](../includes/applies-to-external-only.md)]

In external tenants, you can register applications that use the OpenID Connect (OIDC) or Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) protocol for authentication and single sign-on. The [app registration](how-to-register-ciam-app.md) process is designed specifically for OIDC apps. But you can use the Enterprise applications feature to create and register your SAML app. This process generates a unique application ID (client ID) and adds your app to the App registrations, where you can view and manage its properties.

This article describes how to register your own SAML application in your external tenant by creating a *non-gallery* app in **Enterprise applications**.

> 
> To try out SAML app with External ID for customer identity and access management (CIAM), go to the Woodgrove live demo and select the sign-in option.


> [!NOTE]
> The following capabilities aren't supported for SAML apps in external tenants:
>- Preintegrated SAML applications in the Microsoft Entra gallery aren't supported in external tenants.
>- The availability of the **Provisioning** tab in the SAML app settings is a known issue. Provisioning isn't supported for apps in external tenants.
>- IdP initiated flow isn't supported.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account that has an active subscription. <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F" target="_blank">Create an account for free</a>.
- A Microsoft Entra [external tenant](how-to-create-external-tenant-portal.md).
- [A sign-up and sign-in user flow](how-to-user-flow-sign-up-sign-in-customers.md).

## Create and register a SAML app

1. Sign in to the Microsoft Entra admin center as at least an Application Administrator.
1. If you have access to multiple tenants, use the **Settings** icon :::image type="icon" source="media/common/admin-center-settings-icon.png" border="false"::: in the top menu and switch to your external tenant from the **Directories** menu.
1. Go to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps**.
1. Select **New application**.

1. Select **Create your own application**.

      :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-register-saml-app/create-your-own-application.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Create your own application option in the Microsoft Entra Gallery.":::

1. On the **Create your own application** pane, enter a name for your app.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You might see a gallery app selector, but you can disregard it as gallery apps aren't supported in external tenants.

1. Select "**(Preview) Integrate any other application you don't find in the gallery (Non-gallery)**".

1. Select **Create**.

1. The app **Overview** page opens. In the left menu under **Manage**, select **Properties**. Switch the **Assignment required?** toggle to **No** so that users can use self-service sign-up, and then select **Save**.

      :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-register-saml-app/assignment-toggle-no.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Assignment required toggle.":::

1. In the left menu under **Manage**, select **Single sign-on (Preview)**.
1. Under **Select a single sign-on method**, select **SAML (preview)**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-register-saml-app/select-single-sign-on-method.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Single sign-on method tile.":::

1. On the **SAML-based Sign-on (Preview)** page, do one of the following:

   - Select **Upload metadata file**, browse to the file containing your metadata, and then select **Add**. Select **Save**.
   - Or, use the **Edit** pencil option to update each section, and then select **Save**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Make sure your SAML app uses your `ciamlogin` endpoint, for example `domainname.ciamlogin.com`, instead of `login.microsoft.com`. If you're downloading the federation metadata URL, it should be in the form `domain.ciamlogin.com/<tenantid>/federationmetadata/2007-06/federationmetadata.xml?appid=<appid>`.

1. Select **Test**, and then select the **Test sign-in** button to see if single sign-on is working. This test verifies that your current admin account can sign in using the `https://login.microsoftonline.com` endpoint.  

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-register-saml-app/test-application.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the test single sign-on option.":::

   You can test external user sign-in with these steps:
   - [Create a sign-up and sign-in user flow](~/external-id/customers/how-to-user-flow-sign-up-sign-in-customers.md) if you haven't already.
   - [Add your SAML application to the user flow](~/external-id/customers/how-to-user-flow-add-application.md).
   - Run your application.

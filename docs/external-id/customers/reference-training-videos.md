# Microsoft Entra External ID training, live demo, and videos

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-external-only](../includes/applies-to-external-only.md)]

## Training module

The Microsoft Entra External ID training module serves as a proof of concept for exploring, understanding, and evaluating Microsoft Entra External ID. It guides you through a hypothetical scenario where you work for an online grocery store that uses Microsoft Entra External ID to register and sign in your customers. By the end of the module, a working prototype will be running in your own environment.

In the training module, you'll:

- Create your first Microsoft Entra External ID tenant.
- Build a branded, seamless, and secure sign-up and sign-in experience for your web application.
- Evaluate Microsoft Entra External ID identity provider capabilities against consumer and business customer needs.
- Protect access to your application with conditional access and multifactor authentication.

To start the training, go to [Guided project – Build a sample app to evaluate Microsoft Entra External ID](https://aka.ms/eeid/training-module) and follow the units in order.

## Woodgrove Groceries live demo

The Woodgrove Groceries live demo app is a fictional grocery store that incorporates Microsoft Entra External ID into its online shopping platform. It illustrates several common authentication experiences that can be configured for your apps. To explore the demo environment, visit [Woodgrove Groceries](https://woodgrovedemo.com/). On the right side of the screen, choose the **Select a use case** button, or use [this link](https://woodgrovedemo.com/#usecase=Default). Then, choose from a list of features and use cases related to authentication experiences.

### Authorize access to your application

This video explores the intricacies of role-based control and claims-based authorization for applications using Microsoft Entra ID and Microsoft Entra External ID.

The [second part](https://youtu.be/Sc1y4WBHP2k?si=kDCv0Cts5UUHyM-b) guides you through setting up application role-based access control using Microsoft Entra External ID and shows how to effectively integrate it into your application and web APIs.

### Step-up authentication

The video explains step-up authentication and tenant configuration. In step-up authentication, users sign in with minimal authentication steps, like a username and password, or a social identity. However, upon risky actions, like high-value transactions or accessing sensitive data, the application requires more verification.

### Extending authentication flows with your own business logic

This video explains the concept of a custom claims provider, which enables you to define attributes from external systems via a REST API you create. These attributes then get added to the security token returned to your application.

The second part shows how to [configure Microsoft Entra ID custom claims provider](https://youtu.be/fxQGVIwX8_4?si=vwcYT7wn7OzL6MzK) with the token issuance start event type, which triggers just before a security token is issued.  This event allows you to call a REST API to add claims to the token that's returned to your application.

### Edit user's profile

In this video, we’ll explore the various methods available for accessing and editing user profiles in Microsoft Entra External ID.

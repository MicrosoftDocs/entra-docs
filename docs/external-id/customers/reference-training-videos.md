## Training module

The Microsoft Entra External ID training module serves as a proof of concept for exploring, understanding, and evaluating Microsoft Entra External ID. It guides you through a hypothetical scenario where you work for an online grocery store that uses Microsoft Entra External ID to register and sign in your customers. By the end of the module, a working prototype will be running in your own environment.

In the training module, you'll:

- Create your first Microsoft Entra External ID tenant.
- Build a branded, seamless, and secure sign-up and sign-in experience for your web application.
- Evaluate Microsoft Entra External ID identity provider capabilities against consumer and business customer needs.
- Protect access to your application with Conditional Access and multifactor authentication.

To start the training, go to [Guided project – Build a sample app to evaluate Microsoft Entra External ID](https://aka.ms/eeid/training-module) and follow the units in order.

# Tutorial: Authenticate users in a Node.js CLI application

This tutorial is the final part of a tutorial series that demonstrates building a Node.js command line interface (CLI) app and preparing it for authentication using the Microsoft Entra admin center. In [part 2 of this series](./tutorial-cli-app-node-sign-in-prepare-app.md), you built a Node.js CLI application and prepared it for authentication. This tutorial shows you how to authenticate users in the Node.js CLI application you built.

## Import MSAL and the configuration

The CLI application we're building uses the Microsoft Authentication Library for Node to authenticate users. To import the `MSAL Node` package and the `msalConfig` and `loginRequest` configurations defined in the previous tutorial, add the following code to *index.js*:

```javascript
const { PublicClientApplication, InteractionRequiredAuthError } = require('@azure/msal-node');
const open = require('open');
const { msalConfig, loginRequest } = require('./authConfig');
```

In this code snippet, you import the `PublicClientApplication` and `InteractionRequiredAuthError` classes from the `@azure/msal-node` package. You also import the `open` package that's enables the app to open a browser window for user interaction. 

## Create an instance of a PublicClientApplication object

To use MSAL Node, you must first create an instance of a [`PublicClientApplication`](/javascript/api/@azure/msal-node/publicclientapplication) object using the `msalConfig` object. The initialized `PublicClientApplication` object is used to authenticate the user and obtain an access token. 

In *index.js*, add the following code to initialize the public client application:

```javascript
const pca = new PublicClientApplication(msalConfig);
```

## Launch browser window for user interaction

For users to sign in and consent to the scopes that the app requires, define the `openBrowser` function that opens a browser window for user interaction, as shown:

```javascript
const openBrowser = async (url) => {
    open(url);
};
```

## Create a token request object

Next, create a `tokenRequest` object by combining properties in the `loginRequest` (imported from *authConfig.js*) and the `openBrowser` function by adding the following code to *index.js*:

```javascript
const tokenRequest = {
    ...loginRequest,
    openBrowser,
    successTemplate: '<h1>Successfully signed in!</h1> <p>You can close this window now.</p>',
    errorTemplate:
        '<h1>Oops! Something went wrong</h1> <p>Navigate back to the Electron application and check the console for more information.</p>',
};
```
The `successTemplate` and `errorTemplate` are HTML templates used for displaying messages after authentication.

## Define function to acquire tokens

To create the `acquireToken` function that the application uses to obtain an access token for the user, add the following code to *index.js*:

```javascript
const acquireToken = async () => {
    const accounts = await pca.getTokenCache().getAllAccounts();
    if (accounts.length === 1) {
        // Try to acquire token silently for the single account.
        // If silent acquisition fails, use interactive authentication.
        const silentRequest = {
            account: accounts[0],
        };
        return pca.acquireTokenSilent(silentRequest).catch((e) => {
            if (e instanceof InteractionRequiredAuthError) {
                return pca.acquireTokenInteractive(tokenRequest);
            }
        });
    } else if (accounts.length > 1) {
        // Multiple accounts found. Prompt the user to select an account.
        accounts.forEach((account) => {
            console.log(account.username);
        });
        return Promise.reject('Multiple accounts found. Please select an account to use.');
    } else {
        // No account found. Use interactive authentication.
        return pca.acquireTokenInteractive(tokenRequest);
    }
};
```
In this code snippet, the `acquireToken` function tries to get an access token for a single account silently; if it fails, it uses interactive authentication. If multiple accounts are found, it prompts the user to select an account, and if no account is found, it initiates interactive authentication to prompt the user for sign-in and consent.

## Initiate the authentication flow

Finally, call the `acquireToken()` function to initiate the authentication flow by adding the following code to *index.js*:

```javascript
acquireToken()
    .then((response) => {
        console.log(response);
    })
    .catch((e) => {
        console.error(e);
        process.exit(1);
    });
```

If the call to `acquireToken()` is successful, the response, which contains an access token, is logged to the console. If there's an error during authentication, the error is logged, and the process exits with an error code.

## Run and test the sample Node.js CLI application

To run and test your Node.js CLI application, ensure you've replaced the placeholder values in the *authConfig.js* file with your Microsoft Entra app registration details. You can now test the application you built by following these steps:

1. In your terminal, run the following command:

    ```powershell
   cd 1-Authentication\6-sign-in-node-cli-app\App
    npm start
    ```

1. The browser opens up automatically and you should see a page similar to the following:

     :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-node-cli-app-sign-in/node-cli-app-sign-in-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the sign in page in a node CLI application.":::

1. On the sign-in page, type your **Email address**. If you don't have an account, select **No account? Create one**, which starts the sign-up flow.

1. If you choose the sign-up option, after filling in your email, one-time passcode, new password and more account details, you complete the whole sign-up flow. After completing the sign up flow and signing in, you see a page similar to the following screenshot:

     :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-node-cli-app-sign-in/node-cli-app-signed-in-user.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing a signed-in user in a node CLI application.":::

1. Move back to the terminal and see your authentication information including the ID token claims returned by Microsoft Entra.

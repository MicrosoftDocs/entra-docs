# Add the SAML/WS-Fed identity provider to a user flow

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-external-only](../includes/applies-to-external-only.md)]

Once you've configured federation with a SAML or WS-Fed identity provider by following the steps in [Add federation with SAML/WS-Fed identity providers](../direct-federation.md), the identity provider is set up in your external tenant, but it's not yet available in any of the sign-in pages. 

## Prerequisites

- An [external tenant](how-to-create-external-tenant-portal.md).
- A registered application in the tenant.
- A [federated SAML or WS-Fed identity provider](../direct-federation.md).
- A sign-up and sign-in user flow.

## Add the identity provider to a user flow

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least an [External ID User Flow Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#external-id-user-flow-administrator).

1. Switch to your *external* tenant: Select the **Settings** icon in the top menu, and then switch to your external tenant.

1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **External Identities** > **User flows**.

1. Select the user flow where you want to add the identity provider.

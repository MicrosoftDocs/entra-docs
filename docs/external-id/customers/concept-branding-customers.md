# Customize the look and feel of the authentication experience for the external tenant

After creating a new external tenant, you can customize the appearance of your web-based applications for customers who sign in, sign up, or sign out to personalize their end-user experience. The external tenant comes with a default neutral branding that doesn’t include any existing Microsoft branding. However, this neutral default branding can be customized to meet your company’s specific needs. You have the flexibility to add a custom background image or color, favicon, layout, header, and footer to your authentication experience. You can add each custom branding property individually to the custom sign-in page, or you can upload a custom CSS. For more information, see [Customize the neutral branding in your external tenant](how-to-customize-branding-customers.md).

If the custom company branding fails to load, the sign-in page reverts to the neutral branding. 

The following list and image outline the elements of the neutral branding sign-in experience:

1. Background image and color.
1. Favicon.
1. Banner logo.
1. Footer as a page layout element.
1. Footer hyperlinks, for example,  Privacy & cookies, Terms of use and troubleshooting details also known as ellipsis in the right bottom corner of the screen.

As a comparison, here’s how the [default Microsoft sign-in experience](~/fundamentals/how-to-customize-branding.md) in a Microsoft Entra ID tenant looks:

## Text customization

You might have different requirements for the information you want to collect during sign-up and sign-in. The external tenant comes with a built-in set of information stored in attributes, such as Given Name, Surname, City, and Postal Code. In the external tenant, we have two options to add custom text to the sign-up and sign-in experience. The function is available under each user flow during language customization and also under **Company Branding**. Although we have two ways to customize strings, both ways modify the same JSON file. The most recent change made either via **User flows** or via **Company Branding** will always override the previous one.

## Language customization

You can create a personalized sign-in experience for users who sign in using a specific browser language by customizing the branding elements. If you don't make any changes to the elements, the default elements will be displayed.
In the tenant you can add a custom language to the sign-in experience under **Company Branding** or to a specific user flow under **User flows**. The language customization is available for a list of languages. For more information, see [Customize the language of the authentication experience](how-to-customize-languages-customers.md).

## Microsoft Graph APIs

You can also manage company branding and configure all assets programmatically. 
- For the default branding, use the [organizationalBranding resource type](/graph/api/resources/organizationalbranding) and its associated methods.
- To customize branding based on locale, using the [organizationalBrandingLocalization resource type](/graph/api/resources/organizationalbrandinglocalization) resource type and its associated methods.

# Test your protected API

This tutorial is the final part of a series that demonstrates building and testing a protected web API that is registered in an external tenant. In [Part 1 of this series](./tutorial-protect-web-api-dotnet-core-build-app.md), you created an ASP.NET Core web API and protected its endpoints. In this final step, you'll register the daemon app, and test your API.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

## Prerequisites

[Tutorial: Secure an ASP.NET Core web API registered in an external tenant](./tutorial-protect-web-api-dotnet-core-build-app.md)

## Register the daemon app

[!INCLUDE [Register daemon app](./includes/register-app/register-daemon-app.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Add app client secret](./includes/register-app/add-app-client-secret.md)]

## Assign app role to your daemon app

Apps authenticating by themselves require app permissions.

[!INCLUDE [Add app client secret](./includes/register-app/grant-api-permissions-app-permissions.md)]

## Write code

1. Initialize a .NET console app and navigate to its root folder

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet new console -o MyTestApp
    cd MyTestApp
    ```

1. Install MSAL to help you with handling authentication by running the following command:

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet add package Microsoft.Identity.Client
    ```

1. Run your API project and note the port on which it's running.
1. Open the *Program.cs* file and replace the "Hello world" code with the following code.

    ```csharp
    using System;
    using System.Net.Http;
    using System.Net.Http.Headers;

    HttpClient client = new HttpClient();

    var response = await client.GetAsync("https://localhost:<your-api-port>/api/todolist");
    Console.WriteLine("Your response is: " + response.StatusCode);
    ```

    Navigate to the daemon app root directory and run app using the command `dotnet run`. This code sends a request without an access token. You should see the string: *Your response is: Unauthorized* printed in your console.
1. Remove the code in step 4 and replace with the following to test your API by sending a request with a valid access token.

    ```csharp
    using Microsoft.Identity.Client;
    using System;
    using System.Net.Http;
    using System.Net.Http.Headers;

    HttpClient client = new HttpClient();

    var clientId = "<your-daemon-app-client-id>";
    var clientSecret = "<your-daemon-app-secret>";
    var scopes = new[] {"api://<your-web-api-application-id>/.default"};
    var tenantName= "<your-tenant-name>";
    var authority = $"https://{tenantName}.ciamlogin.com/";

    var app = ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder
        .Create(clientId)
        .WithAuthority(authority)
        .WithClientSecret(clientSecret)
        .Build();

    var result = await app.AcquireTokenForClient(scopes).ExecuteAsync();

    client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", result.AccessToken);
    var response = await client.GetAsync("https://localhost:44351/api/todolist");
    Console.WriteLine("Your response is: " + response.StatusCode);
    ```

    Navigate to the daemon app root directory and run app using the command `dotnet run`. This code sends a request with a valid access token. You should see the string: *Your response is: OK* printed in your console.

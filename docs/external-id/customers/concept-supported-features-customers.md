# Supported features in Microsoft Entra External ID (preview)

Microsoft Entra External ID is designed for businesses that want to make applications available to their customers, using the Microsoft Entra platform for identity and access. With the introduction of this feature, Microsoft Entra ID now offers two different types of tenants that you can create and manage:

- A **workforce tenant** contains your employees and the apps and resources that are internal to your organization. If you've worked with Microsoft Entra ID, this is the type of tenant you're already familiar with. You might already have an existing workforce tenant for your organization.

- A **external tenant** represents your customer-facing app, resources, and directory of customer accounts. an external tenant is distinct and separate from your workforce tenant.

[!INCLUDE [preview-alert](../customers/includes/preview-alert/preview-alert-ciam.md)]

## Compare workforce and external tenant capabilities

Although workforce tenants and external tenants are built on the same underlying Microsoft Entra platform, there are some feature differences. The following table compares the features available in each type of tenant.

> [!NOTE]
> During preview, features or capabilities that require a premium license are unavailable in external tenants.

|Feature  |Workforce tenant  | External tenant |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **External identities scenario** | Allow business partners and other external users to collaborate with your workforce. Guests can securely access your business applications through invitations or self-service sign-up.  | Use External ID to secure your external-facing applications. Consumers and business customers can securely access your consumer apps through self-service sign-up. Invitations are also supported (preview).  |
| **Local accounts** | Local accounts are supported for *internal* members of your organization only.    | Local accounts are supported for:</br>- External users (consumers, business customers) who use self-service sign-up.</br>- Accounts created by admins. |
| **Identity providers for external users** | Self-service sign-up guests:</br>- Microsoft Entra accounts</br>- Microsoft accounts</br>- Email one-time passcode</br>- Google federation</br>- Facebook federation<br></br>Invited guests:</br>- Microsoft Entra accounts</br>- Microsoft accounts</br>- Email one-time passcode</br>- Google federation</br>- SAML/WS-Fed federation | Self-service sign-up users (consumers, business customers):</br>- [Email with password](concept-authentication-methods-customers.md#email-and-password-sign-in)</br>- [Email one-time passcode](./concept-authentication-methods-customers.md#email-with-one-time-passcode-sign-in)</br>- [Google federation](./how-to-google-federation-customers.md)</br>- [Facebook federation](./how-to-facebook-federation-customers.md) |
|   **Authentication methods**  | - Internal users (employees and admins): [How each authentication method works](~/identity/authentication/concept-authentication-methods.md#how-each-authentication-method-works) </br>- Guests (invited or self-service sign-up): [Authentication methods for external users](../authentication-conditional-access.md#table-1-authentication-strength-mfa-methods-for-external-users)  |  Self-service sign-up users (consumers, business customers):</br>- [Email one-time passcode](./concept-authentication-methods-customers.md#email-with-one-time-passcode-sign-in)    |
| **Groups** | [Groups](~/fundamentals/how-to-manage-groups.yml) can be used to manage administrative and user accounts.| Groups can be used to manage administrative accounts. Support for Microsoft Entra groups and [application roles](how-to-use-app-roles-customers.md) is being phased into customer tenants. For the latest updates, see [Groups and application roles support](reference-group-app-roles-support.md). |
| **Roles and administrators**| [Roles and administrators](~/fundamentals/how-subscriptions-associated-directory.yml) are fully supported for administrative and user accounts. | Roles aren't supported with customer accounts. Customer accounts don't have access to tenant resources.|
| **Custom domain names** |  You can use [custom domains](~/fundamentals/add-custom-domain.yml) for administrative accounts only. | Not currently supported. However, the URLs visible to customers in sign-up and sign-in pages are neutral, unbranded URLs. [Learn more](concept-branding-customers.md)|

|   **Identity protection**    |   Provides ongoing risk detection for your Microsoft Entra tenant. It allows organizations to discover, investigate, and remediate identity-based risks.    |   A subset of the Microsoft Entra ID Protection risk detections is available. [Learn more](how-to-identity-protection-customers.md).    |
|   **Custom authentication extension**    |   Add claims from external systems.    |   [Add claims from external systems](./concept-custom-extensions.md).    |

[Learn more](how-to-enable-password-reset-customers.md).     |  
|   **Company branding**    |   Microsoft Entra tenant supports Microsoft look and feel as a default state for authentication experience. Administrators can customize the default Microsoft sign-in experience.    |   Microsoft provides a neutral branding as the default for the external tenant, which can be customized to meet the specific needs of your company. The default branding for the external tenant is neutral and doesn't include any existing Microsoft branding. [Learn more](concept-branding-customers.md).    |  
|   **Language customization**    | Customize the sign-in experience based on browser language when users authenticate into your corporate intranet or web-based applications.     |   Use languages to modify the strings displayed to your customers as part of the sign-in and sign-up process. [Learn more](concept-branding-customers.md).   |
|   **Custom attributes**    |    Use directory extension attributes to store more data in the Microsoft Entra directory for user objects, groups, tenant details, and service principals.    |   Use directory extension attributes to store more data in the customer directory for user objects. Create custom user attributes and add them to your sign-up user flow. [Learn more](how-to-define-custom-attributes.md).    |

| **API permissions** | Add, remove, and replace permissions to an application. After permissions are added to your application, users or admins need to grant consent to the new permissions. Learn more about [updating an app's requested permissions in Microsoft Entra ID](../../identity-platform/howto-update-permissions.md).  | For customer-facing applications, the following are the allowed permissions: Microsoft Graph `offline_access`, `openid`, and `User.Read` and your **My APIs** delegated permissions. Only an admin can consent on behalf of the organization.  |
| **Expose an API** | [Define custom scopes](../../identity-platform/quickstart-configure-app-expose-web-apis.md) to restrict access to data and functionality protected by the API.

An application that requires access to parts of this API can request that admin consent to one or more of these scopes. |

This role grants the ability to create and manage all aspects of application registrations and enterprise applications.  |
|**Assigning users and groups to an app**| When user assignment is required, only those users you assign to the application (either through direct user assignment or based on group membership) are able to sign in. For more information, see [manage users and groups assignment to an application](~/identity/enterprise-apps/assign-user-or-group-access-portal.md)| Not available |

## OpenID Connect and OAuth2 flows

The following table compares the features available for OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect authorization flows in each type of tenant.

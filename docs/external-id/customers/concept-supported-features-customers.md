# Supported features in workforce and external tenants

There are two ways to configure a Microsoft Entra tenant, depending on how the organization intends to use the tenant and the resources they want to manage:

- A **workforce** tenant configuration is for your employees, internal business apps, and other organizational resources. B2B collaboration is used in a workforce tenant to collaborate with external business partners and guests.
- An **external** tenant configuration is used exclusively for External ID scenarios where you want to publish apps to consumers or business customers.

This article gives a detailed comparison of the features and capabilities available in [workforce and external tenants](../tenant-configurations.md).

> [!NOTE]
> During preview, features or capabilities that require a premium license are unavailable in external tenants.

## General feature comparison

The following table compares the general features and capabilities available in workforce and external tenants.

|Feature  |Workforce tenant  | External tenant |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **External identities scenario** | Allow business partners and other external users to collaborate with your workforce. Guests can securely access your business applications through invitations or self-service sign-up.  | Use External ID to secure your applications. Consumers and business customers can securely access your consumer apps through self-service sign-up. Invitations are also supported.  |
| **Local accounts** | Local accounts are supported for *internal* members of your organization only.    | Local accounts are supported for:<ul><li> Consumers and business customers who use self-service sign-up. </li><li>Admin-created internal accounts (with or without an admin role).</li></ul> **Note:** All users in an external tenant have [default permissions](reference-user-permissions.md) unless they’re [assigned an admin role](how-to-manage-admin-accounts.md).  |
| **Groups** | [Groups](/entra/fundamentals/how-to-manage-groups) can be used to manage administrative and user accounts.| Groups can be used to manage administrative accounts. Support for Microsoft Entra groups and [application roles](how-to-use-app-roles-customers.md) is being phased into customer tenants. For the latest updates, see [Groups and application roles support](reference-group-app-roles-support.md). |
| **Roles and administrators**| [Roles and administrators](~/fundamentals/how-subscriptions-associated-directory.yml) are fully supported for administrative and user accounts. | Roles are supported for all users. All users in an external tenant have [default permissions](reference-user-permissions.md) unless they’re assigned an [admin role](how-to-manage-admin-accounts.md).|
| **ID Protection**    |   Provides ongoing risk detection for your Microsoft Entra tenant. It allows organizations to discover, investigate, and remediate identity-based risks.    |   Not available    |
| **ID Governance**    |   Enables organizations to govern identity and access lifecycles, and secure privileged access. [Learn more](~/id-governance/identity-governance-overview.md).    |   Not available    |
| **Self-service password reset**    |   Allow users to reset their password using up to two authentication methods (see the next row for available methods).    |   Allow users to reset their password using email with one time passcode. [Learn more](how-to-enable-password-reset-customers.md).     |  
| **Language customization**    | Customize the sign-in experience based on browser language when users authenticate into your corporate intranet or web-based applications.     |   Use languages to modify the strings displayed to your customers as part of the sign-in and sign-up process. [Learn more](concept-branding-customers.md).   |
| **Custom attributes**    |    Use directory extension attributes to store more data in the Microsoft Entra directory for user objects, groups, tenant details, and service principals.    |   Use directory extension attributes to store more data in the customer directory for user objects. Create custom user attributes and add them to your sign-up user flow. [Learn more](how-to-define-custom-attributes.md).    |
| **Pricing**    | [Monthly active users (MAU) pricing](../external-identities-pricing.md) for B2B collaboration external guests (UserType=Guest).      | [Monthly active users (MAU) pricing](../external-identities-pricing.md) for all users in the external tenant regardless of role or UserType.    |


## Look and feel customization

The following table compares the features available for look and feel customization in workforce and external tenants.

|Feature  |Workforce tenant  | External tenant |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Company branding** | You can add [company branding](~/fundamentals/how-to-customize-branding.md) that applies to all these experiences to create a consistent sign-in experience for your users. | Same as workforce. [Learn more](how-to-customize-branding-customers.md) |
| **Language customization** | [Customize the sign-in experience by browser language](~/fundamentals/how-to-customize-branding.md). | Same as workforce. [Learn more](how-to-customize-languages-customers.md) |

| **Native authentication** for mobile apps| Not available |Microsoft Entra’s [native authentication](concept-native-authentication.md) allows you to have full control over the design of your mobile application sign-in experiences.|


## Adding your own business logic

Custom authentication extensions allow you to customize the Microsoft Entra authentication experience by integrating with external systems. A custom authentication extension is essentially an event listener that, when activated, makes an HTTP call to a REST API endpoint where you define your own business logic. The following table compares the [custom authentication extensions](./concept-custom-extensions.md) events available in workforce and external tenants.

|Event  |Workforce tenant  | External tenant |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **TokenIssuanceStart**    |  [Add claims from external systems](~/identity-platform/custom-extension-overview.md).    |   [Add claims from external systems](./concept-custom-extensions.md).    |  
| **OnAttributeCollectionStart**|Not available| Occurs at the beginning of the sign-up's attribute collection step, before the attribute collection page renders. You can add actions such as prefilling values and displaying a blocking error. [Learn more](~/identity-platform/custom-extension-attribute-collection.md?toc=%2Fentra%2Fexternal-id%2Ftoc.json&bc=%2Fentra%2Fexternal-id%2Fbreadcrumb%2Ftoc.json&tabs=start-continue%2Csubmit-continue) |
| **OnAttributeCollectionSubmit**|Not available| Occurs during the sign-up flow, after the user enters and submits attributes. You can add actions such as validating or modifying the user's entries.

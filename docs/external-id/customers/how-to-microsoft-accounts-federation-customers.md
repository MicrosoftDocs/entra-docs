# Add Microsoft account (live.com) as an OpenID Connect identity provider

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-external-only](../includes/applies-to-external-only.md)]

By setting up federation with Microsoft account (live.com) using OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider, you enable users to sign up and sign in to your applications using their existing Microsoft accounts (MSA).
After you add the MSA (live.com) as one of your user flow's sign-in options, customers can sign up and sign in to your application with their Microsoft account.

>
> To try out this feature, go to the Woodgrove Groceries demo and start the “Microsoft personal account (live.com)” use case.

## Prerequisites

- An [external tenant](how-to-create-external-tenant-portal.md).
- A [sign-up and sign-in user flow](how-to-user-flow-sign-up-sign-in-customers.md).
- A Microsoft account (live.com). If you don't already have one, sign up at https://www.live.com/.

## Create a Microsoft account application

To enable sign-in for users with a Microsoft account, you need to create an application in a Microsoft Entra ID tenant. The resource tenant for the application can be any Microsoft Entra ID tenant, like your workforce or external tenant.  

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **App registrations** then select **New registration**.
1. Name the application, for example *ContosoApp*.
1. Under **Supported account types**, select _Personal Microsoft accounts only_.
1. Under **Redirect URI**, select **Web** and enter your populated redirect URI explained [here](/entra/external-id/customers/how-to-custom-oidc-federation-customers#set-up-your-openid-connect-identity-provider)
1. Select **Register**.

   When registration finishes, the Microsoft Entra admin center displays the app registration's **Overview** pane. You see the **Application (client) ID**. Record this value, as you need it later.

7. Under **Manage** browse to **Certificate & secrets** then select **New client secret**.
8. Name the secret, for example *Key 1* and select **Add**.
9. Record the **Value** of the secret, as you need it later. Make sure to save the secret before leaving the page. Client secret values cannot be viewed, except for immediately after creation.

### Configure optional claims

You can also configure optional claims to be provided for your application such as *family_name* and *given_name*.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator). 
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **App registrations**.
1. Select your MSA application that you created earlier.
1. Under **Manage**, select **Token configuration**.
1. Select **Add optional claim**.
1. Select the token type you want to configure, such as *ID*.
1. Select the optional claims to add.
1. Select **Add**.

## Configure the Microsoft account (live.com) as an OpenID connect identity provider

Once you have configured your Microsoft account (live.com) as an application, you can proceed to set it up as an OIDC identity provider in your external tenant.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least an [External Identity Provider Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#external-identity-provider-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **External Identities** > **All identity providers**.
1. Select the **Custom** tab, and then select **Add new** > **Open ID Connect**.

      :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-custom-oidc-federation-customers/add-new.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot of adding a new custom identity provider.":::

1. Enter the following details for your identity provider on the **Basics** tab:
      - **Display name**: Enter a name for your identity provider, for example *Microsoft account* This name is displayed to your users during the sign-in and sign-up flows. For example, *Sign in with Microsoft account* or *Sign up with your Microsoft account*.
      - **Well-known endpoint**: Enter the endpoint URI as `https://login.microsoftonline.com/consumers/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration`, which is the discovery URI of the common authority URL for Microsoft accounts.
      - **OpenID Issuer URI**: Enter the Issuer URI as `https://login.live.com`.
      - **Client ID** and **Client Secret**: Enter the **Application (client) ID** and **Value** of the client secret you created earlier.
      - **Client Authentication**:  Select **client_secret** and add	`openid profile email` to **Scope**.
      - **Response type**: Select **code**.
1. You can select **Next: Claims mapping** to configure [claims mapping](reference-oidc-claims-mapping-customers.md) or **Review + create** to add your identity provider.

## Add OIDC identity provider to a user flow

At this point, the MSA identity provider has been set up in your Microsoft Entra ID, but it's not yet available in any of the sign-in pages. To add the OIDC identity provider to a user flow:

1. In your external tenant, browse to **Entra ID** > **External Identities** > **User flows**.
1. Select the user flow where you want to add the OIDC identity provider.
1. Under Settings, select **Identity providers.**
1. Under **Other Identity Providers**, select the identity provider you created, which is **Microsoft Account**.

1. Select **Save**.

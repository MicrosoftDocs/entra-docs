# Add multifactor authentication (MFA) to an app

[Multifactor authentication](~/identity/authentication/concept-mfa-howitworks.md) (MFA) adds a layer of security to your applications. With MFA, customers who sign in with a username and password are prompted for a one-time passcode as a second verification method. This article describes how to enforce MFA for your customers by creating a Microsoft Entra Conditional Access policy and adding MFA to your sign-up and sign-in user flow.

## Prerequisites

- A Microsoft Entra external tenant (if you don't have a tenant, you can start a <a href="https://aka.ms/ciam-free-trial?wt.mc_id=ciamcustomertenantfreetrial_linkclick_content_cnl" target="_blank">free trial</a>.
- A [sign-up and sign-in user flow](how-to-user-flow-sign-up-sign-in-customers.md).
- An app that's registered in your external tenant, added to the sign-up and sign-in user flow, and updated to point to the user flow for authentication.
- An account with Conditional Access Administrator, Security Administrator, or Global Administrator privileges to configure Conditional Access policies and MFA.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to enable MFA, set your local account authentication method to **Email with password**. If you set your local account option to **Email with one-time passcode**, customers who use this method won't be able to sign in because the one-time passcode is already their first-factor sign-in method and can't be used as a second factor. Currently, one-time passcode is the only method available for MFA in external tenants.

## Create a Conditional Access policy

Create a Conditional Access policy in your external tenant that prompts users for MFA when they sign up or sign in to your app. (For more information, see [Common Conditional Access policy: Require MFA for all users](~/identity/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-all-users-mfa.md)).

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as a Conditional Access Administrator, Security Administrator, or Global Administrator.

1. If you have access to multiple tenants, use the **Settings** icon :::image type="icon" source="media/common/admin-center-settings-icon.png" border="false"::: in the top menu to switch to your external tenant from the **Directories + subscriptions** menu.

1. Browse to **Identity** > **Protection** > **Security Center**.

1. Select **Conditional Access** > **Policies**, and then select **New policy**.

1. Give your policy a name. We recommend that organizations create a meaningful standard for the names of their policies.

1. Under **Assignments**, select the link under **Users**.

   a. On the **Include** tab, select **All users**.

   b. On the **Exclude** tab, select **Users and groups** and choose your organization's emergency access or break-glass accounts.

1. Select the link under **Cloud apps or actions**. 

   a. On the Include tab, choose one of the following options:

      - Choose **All cloud apps**.

      - Choose **Select apps** and select the link under **Select**. Find your app, select it, and then choose **Select**.

   b. Under **Exclude**, select any applications that don't require multifactor authentication.

1. Under **Access controls** select the link under **Grant**. Select **Grant access**, select **Require multifactor authentication**, and then choose **Select**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-multifactor-authentication-customers/new-policy-grant-require-mfa.png" alt-text="Screenshot of requiring MFA." lightbox="media/how-to-multifactor-authentication-customers/new-policy-grant-require-mfa.png":::

1. Confirm your settings and set **Enable policy** to **On**.

1. Select **Create** to create to enable your policy.

## Enable email one-time passcode as an MFA method

Enable the email one-time passcode authentication method in your external tenant for all users.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com).

1. Browse to **Identity** > **Protection** > **Authentication methods**.

1. In the **Method** list, select **Email OTP**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-multifactor-authentication-customers/auth-methods-eotp.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the email one-time passcode option." lightbox="media/how-to-multifactor-authentication-customers/auth-methods-eotp.png":::

1. Under **Enable and Target**, turn the **Enable** toggle on.

1. Under **Include**, next to **Target**, select **All users**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-multifactor-authentication-customers/enable-eotp.png" alt-text="Screenshot of enabling email one-time passcode." lightbox="media/how-to-multifactor-authentication-customers/enable-eotp.png":::

1. Select **Save**.

## Test the sign-in

In a private browser, open your application and select **Sign-in**. You should be prompted for another authentication method.

# Integrate Microsoft Entra External ID with Arkose Labs and HUMAN Security for fraud protection (preview)

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-external-only](../includes/applies-to-external-only.md)]

Microsoft Entra External ID supports integration with third-party fraud protection providers, such as [Arkose Labs](https://www.arkoselabs.com/solutions/fake-account-creation/) and [HUMAN](https://www.humansecurity.com/), to help prevent fake account sign-ups and bot attacks. These providers offer comprehensive fraud protection solutions that enable organizations to detect and block automated attacks, such as bot-driven registrations, during the user sign-up process.  

By integrating Arkose Labs, HUMAN, or both with Microsoft Entra External ID, you can leverage their advanced risk assessment capabilities to ensure that only legitimate users create accounts.  

This article explains how to integrate fraud protection providers with Microsoft Entra External ID.

## How Arkose Labs works

When a user attempts to sign up, the Arkose Labs service evaluates the request and determines if it's likely to be fraudulent. If the request is flagged as suspicious, the user is presented with a challenge (like a CAPTCHA) to verify that they're human. If the user successfully completes the challenge, they can proceed with the sign-up process. Once this feature is enabled, you'll be able to view Arkose challenge metrics in the Arkose Labs dashboard. Additionally, you can fine-tune risk policies by coordinating with Arkose Labs support.

You can complete the integration in both the Microsoft Entra admin center and the Microsoft Graph API. This article provides instructions for the Microsoft Entra admin center.

## Prerequisites

- An [external tenant](how-to-create-external-tenant-portal.md).
- A [registered application](/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app) in the tenant.
- An account with at least an [Authentication Extensibility Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#authentication-extensibility-administrator) or [Application Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#application-administrator) role in the external tenant.
- An Arkose Labs account. Go to arkoselabs.com to [request a demo](https://www.arkoselabs.com/bot-management-demo/)
- The following configuration values from Arkose:
    - Public key (GUID format).
    - Private key (GUID format).
    - Client subdomain: use only the subdomain prefix (for example, "client-api"), not the full domain. 
    - Verify subdomain: use only the subdomain prefix (for example, "verify-api"), not the full domain.

## Configure Arkose Labs using Microsoft Graph API

Configure Arkose Labs fraud protection by using the Microsoft Graph API. This approach is useful if you want to automate the configuration or if you prefer using APIs over the Microsoft Entra admin center.

### Step 1: Sign in to the tenant

To configure Arkose Labs fraud protection, you need to sign in to your external tenant and consent to the required permissions.

1. Start [Microsoft Graph Explorer tool](https://aka.ms/ge).

1. Sign in to your external tenant: `https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer?tenant=<your-tenant-name.onmicrosoft.com>`.

1. Select your profile and then select **Consent to permissions**.

1. Consent to the following required permission.

    - `RiskPreventionProviders.ReadWrite.All`

### Step 2: Register Arkose Labs as a fraud protection provider

To register Arkose Labs as a fraud protection provider, you [create a fraudProtectionProvider policy](/graph/api/riskpreventioncontainer-post-fraudprotectionproviders) in your external tenant. This policy contains the Arkose configuration values that you received from Arkose Labs.

1. In the Microsoft Graph Explorer, select the **POST** method and enter the following URL:

    ```http
    https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/identity/riskPrevention/fraudProtectionProviders
    ```

2. In the **Request Body** section, enter the following JSON payload, replacing the placeholders with your Arkose configuration values:

    ```json
    {
        "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.arkoseFraudProtectionProvider",
        "displayName": "<your-arkose-configuration-name>",
        "publicKey": "<your-arkose-public-key>",
        "privateKey": "<your-arkose-private-key>",
        "clientSubDomain": "<your-client-api>",
        "verifySubDomain": "<your-verify-api>"
    }
    ```

3. Select **Run Query** to create the fraud protection provider.
4. If the request is successful, a **201 Created** response is returned. Copy the `id` value from the response for the next step.

### Step 3: Link Arkose protection to your application

In this step, you link the Arkose fraud protection provider to your application by creating a new [authenticationEventListener](/graph/api/identitycontainer-post-authenticationeventlisteners) that triggers the Arkose challenge during the sign-up flow. Make sure that you have the appId for the application where you want to enable fraud protection. Replace `<your-app-id>` with your application's ID, and replace `<id-from-previous-step>` with the Arkose provider ID from the previous step.

1. In the Microsoft Graph Explorer, select the **POST** method and enter the following URL:

    ```http
    https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/identity/authenticationEventListeners
    ```

1. In the **Request Body** section, enter the following JSON payload:

    ```json
    { 
      "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.onFraudProtectionLoadStartListener", 
      "conditions": { 
        "applications": { 
          "includeApplications": [ 
            { 
              "appId": "<your-app-id>" 
            } 
          ] 
        } 
      }, 
      "handler": { 
        "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.onFraudProtectionLoadStartExternalUsersAuthHandler", 
        "signUp": { 
          "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.fraudProtectionProviderConfiguration", 
          "fraudProtectionProvider": { 
            "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.arkoseFraudProtectionProvider", 
            "id": "<id-from-previous-step>" 
          } 
        } 
      } 
    }
    ```

1. Select **Run Query**.
1. If the request is successful, a **201 Created** response is returned. Test the sign-up flow in your application to verify that the Arkose challenge appears when a suspicious sign-up is detected.

### Troubleshooting tips

| Issue                        | Possible Cause                   | Resolution                                              |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Challenge doesn't appear.   | Event listener not linked to app. | Verify app ID and listener configuration.              |
| Users blocked on challenge. | Strict Arkose thresholds.         | Work with Arkose to adjust challenge behavior.         |

## How HUMAN Security works

When a user initiates the sign-up process, it is critical to prevent automated bots and malicious actors from creating fraudulent accounts. To address this, Entra External ID supports integration with third-party fraud detection providers such as HUMAN Security. This integration enables real-time analysis of sign-up attempts, leveraging HUMAN Security’s advanced detection algorithms to identify and block suspicious activity before account creation is completed. The solution is natively integrated with Microsoft identity infrastructure, allowing for streamlined deployment and management. By implementing this approach, organizations can access detailed data and actionable insights to monitor sign-up flows, fine-tune detection thresholds, and respond proactively to emerging threats, thereby maintaining the integrity of their user base.

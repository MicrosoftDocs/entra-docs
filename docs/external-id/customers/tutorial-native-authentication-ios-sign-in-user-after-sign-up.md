# Tutorial: Sign in user automatically after sign-up in an iOS app

This tutorial demonstrates how to sign in user automatically after sign-up in an iOS app by using native authentication.

## Prerequisites 

- [Sign in users in a sample native iOS mobile application](how-to-run-native-authentication-sample-ios-app.md) 
- [Tutorial: Add built-in attributes to sign up with email one-time passcode](tutorial-native-authentication-ios-sign-up-with-email-one-time-passcode.md) 

## Sign in after sign-up 

The `Sign in after sign up` is an enhancement functionality of the sign in user flows, which has the effect of automatically signing in after successfully signing up. The SDK provides developers the ability to sign in a user after signing up, without having to supply the username, or to verify the email address through a one-time passcode. 

To sign in a user after successful sign-up use the `signIn(delegate)` method from the new state `SignInAfterSignUpState` returned in the `onSignUpCompleted(newState)`: 

```swift
extension ViewController: SignUpVerifyCodeDelegate {
    func onSignUpVerifyCodeError(error: MSAL.VerifyCodeError, newState: MSAL.SignUpCodeRequiredState?) {
        resultTextView.text = "Error verifying code: \(error.errorDescription ?? "no description")"
    }

    func onSignUpCompleted(newState: SignInAfterSignUpState) {
        resultTextView.text = "Signed up successfully!"
        newState.signIn(delegate: self)
    }
}
```

The `signIn(delegate)` accepts a delegate parameter and we must implement the required methods in the `SignInAfterSignUpDelegate` protocol. 

In the most common scenario, we receive a call to `onSignInCompleted(result)` indicating that the user has signed in. The result can be used to retrieve the `access token`.

```swift
extension ViewController: SignInAfterSignUpDelegate {
    func onSignInAfterSignUpError(error: SignInAfterSignUpError) {
        resultTextView.text = "Error signing in after sign up"
    }

    func onSignInCompleted(result: MSAL.MSALNativeAuthUserAccountResult) {
        // User successfully signed in
        result.getAccessToken(delegate: self)
    }
}
```

The `getAccessToken(delegate)` accepts a delegate parameter and we must implement the required methods in the `CredentialsDelegate` protocol.

In the most common scenario, we receive a call to `onAccessTokenRetrieveCompleted(result)` indicating that the user obtained an `access token`.

```swift
extension ViewController: CredentialsDelegate {
    func onAccessTokenRetrieveError(error: MSAL.RetrieveAccessTokenError) {
        resultTextView.text = "Error retrieving access token"
    }

    func onAccessTokenRetrieveCompleted(result: MSALNativeAuthTokenResult) {
        resultTextView.text = "Signed in. Access Token: \(result.accessToken)"
    }
}

```

# Tutorial: Add sign-in and sign-out to an ASP.NET Core web application for an external tenant

This tutorial is the final part of a series that demonstrates building an ASP.NET Core web application and prepare it for authentication using the Microsoft Entra admin center. In the [part 2 of this series](./tutorial-web-app-dotnet-sign-in-prepare-app.md), you created an ASP.NET Core project in Visual Studio Code and configured it for authentication. In this final step, you'll add sign-in and sign-out experiences and sign-in and sign-out of the application.

In this tutorial you'll;

## Prerequisites

* [Tutorial: Prepare your external tenant for building an ASP.NET Core web app](./tutorial-web-app-dotnet-sign-in-prepare-tenant.md).

## Add the sign-in and sign out experience

After installing the NuGet packages and adding necessary code for authentication, we need to add the sign-in and sign out experiences. The code reads the ID token claims to check that the user is authenticated and uses `User.Claims` to extract ID token claims.

1. In your IDE, navigate to *Views/Shared*, and create a new file called *_LoginPartial.cshtml*.
1. Open *_LoginPartial.cshtml* and add the following code for adding the sign in and sign out experience. 

    ```csharp
    @using System.Security.Principal

    <ul class="navbar-nav">
    @if (User.Identity is not null && User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
    {
            <li class="nav-item">
                <span class="nav-link text-dark">Hello @User.Claims.First(c => c.Type == "preferred_username").Value!</span>
            </li>
            <li class="nav-item">
                <a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-area="MicrosoftIdentity" asp-controller="Account" asp-action="SignOut">Sign out</a>
            </li>
    }
    else
    {
            <li class="nav-item">
                <a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-area="MicrosoftIdentity" asp-controller="Account" asp-action="SignIn">Sign in</a>
            </li>
    }
    </ul>
    ```

1. Next, add a reference to `_LoginPartial` in the *Layout.cshtml* file, which is located in the same folder. It's recommended to place this after the `navbar-collapse` class as shown in the following snippet:

    ```html
    <div class="navbar-collapse collapse d-sm-inline-flex flex-sm-row-reverse">
        <partial name="_LoginPartial" />
    </div>
    ```

## View ID token claims

The web app is now configured to sign in users with the Microsoft identity platform. The next step is to add code that allows us to view the ID token claims. The app will check that the user is authenticated using `User.Identity.IsAuthenticated`, and lists out the ID token claims by looping through each item in `User.Claims`, returning their `Type` and `Value`.

1. Open *Views/Home/Index.cshtml* and replace the contents of the file with the following snippet:

    ```csharp
    @{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Home Page";
    }
    
    <style>
        table {
            border-collapse: collapse;
            width: 100%;
        }
        th, td {
            text-align: justify;
            padding: 8px;
            border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;
            border-top: 1px solid #ddd;
        }
    </style>
    
    <div class="text-center">
        <h1 class="display-4">Welcome</h1>
    
        @if (@User.Identity is not null && @User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
        {
            <p>You are signed in! Below are the claims in your ID token. For more information, visit: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/id-tokens">Microsoft identity platform ID tokens</a></p>
            <table>
                <tbody>
                    
                    @foreach (var item in @User.Claims)
                    {
                        <tr>
                            <td>@item.Type</td>
                            <td>@item.Value</td>
                        </tr>
                    }
                </tbody>
            </table>
        }

    ```

## Sign-in to the application

1. Start the application by typing the following in the terminal to launch the `https` profile in the *launchSettings.json* file.

    ```powershell
    dotnet run --launch-profile https
    ```

1. Open a new private browser, and enter the application URI into the browser, in this case `https://localhost:7274`.
1. To test the sign-up user flow you configured earlier, select **No account? Create one**.
1. In the **Create account** window, enter the email address registered to your external tenant, which will start the sign-up flow as a user for your application.
1. After entering a one-time passcode from the external tenant, enter a new password and more account details, this sign-up flow is completed.
    1. If a window appears prompting you to **Stay signed in**, choose either **Yes** or **No**.
1. The ASP.NET Core Welcome page appears in your browser as depicted in the following screenshot:

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-web-app-dotnet-sign-in-sign-in-out/display-aspnet-welcome.png" alt-text="Screenshot of sign in into an ASP.NET Core web app.":::

## Sign out of the application

1. To sign out of the application, select **Sign out** in the navigation bar.
1. A window appears asking which account to sign out of.
1. Upon successful sign out, a final window appears advising you to close all browser windows.

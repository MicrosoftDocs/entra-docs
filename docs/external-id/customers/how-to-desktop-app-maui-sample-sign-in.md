# Sign in users in a sample .NET MAUI desktop application

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-external-only](../includes/applies-to-external-only.md)]

This how-to guide uses a sample .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) to show how to add authentication to a desktop application by using an external tenant. The sample application enables users to sign in and sign out. The sample .NET MAUI desktop application uses [Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL)](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet) for .NET to handle authentication.

In this article, you do the following tasks:

- Register a .NET MAUI desktop application in the external tenant.
- Create a sign-in and sign-out user flow in the external tenant.
- Associate your .NET MAUI desktop application with the user flow.
- Update a sample .NET MAUI desktop application to use your own external tenant details.
- Run and test the sample .NET MAUI desktop application.

## Prerequisites

- [.NET 7.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/7.0)
- [Visual Studio 2022](https://aka.ms/vsdownloads) with the MAUI workload installed:
  - [Instructions for Windows](/dotnet/maui/get-started/installation?tabs=vswin)
  - [Instructions for macOS](/dotnet/maui/get-started/installation?tabs=vsmac)
- An external tenant. If you don't already have one, <a href="https://aka.ms/ciam-free-trial?wt.mc_id=ciamcustomertenantfreetrial_linkclick_content_cnl" target="_blank">sign up for a free trial</a>.

## Register .NET MAUI desktop application

[!INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-register-app](./includes/register-app/register-client-app-common.md)]
[!INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-app-integration-add-platform](./includes/register-app/add-platform-redirect-url-dotnet-maui.md)]

## Grant admin consent

[!INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-grant-delegated-permissions](./includes/register-app/grant-api-permission-sign-in.md)]

## Create a user flow

[!INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-app-integration-add-user-flow](./includes/configure-user-flow/create-sign-in-sign-out-user-flow.md)]

## Associate the .NET MAUI desktop application with the user flow

[!INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-app-integration-add-user-flow](./includes/configure-user-flow/add-app-user-flow.md)]

## Clone or download sample .NET MAUI desktop application

To get the .NET MAUI desktop application sample code, [download the .zip file](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-ciam-dotnet-tutorial/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) or clone the sample .NET MAUI desktop application from GitHub by running the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-ciam-dotnet-tutorial.git
```

## Configure the sample .NET MAUI desktop application

1. In Visual Studio, open *ms-identity-ciam-dotnet-tutorial-main/1-Authentication/2-sign-in-maui/appsettings.json* file.
1. Find the placeholder:
    1. `Enter_the_Tenant_Subdomain_Here` and replace it with the Directory (tenant) subdomain. For example, if your tenant primary domain is `contoso.onmicrosoft.com`, use `contoso`. If you don't have your tenant name, learn how to [read your tenant details](how-to-create-external-tenant-portal.md#get-the-external-tenant-details).
   1. `Enter_the_Application_Id_Here` and replace it with the Application (client) ID of the app you registered earlier.

## Run and test sample .NET MAUI desktop application

.NET MAUI apps are designed to run on multiple operating systems and devices. You'll need to select which target you want to test and debug your app with.

Set the **Debug Target** in the Visual Studio toolbar to the device you want to debug and test with. The following steps demonstrate setting the **Debug Target** to *Windows*:

1. Select **Debug Target** drop-down.
1. Select **Framework** 
1. Select **net7.0-windows...**

Run the app by pressing *F5* or select the *play button* at the top of Visual Studio.

1. You can now test the sample .NET MAUI desktop application. After you run the application, the desktop application window appears automatically:

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-desktop-app-maui-sample-sign-in/maui-desktop-sign-in-page.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot of the sign-in button in the desktop application":::

1. On the desktop window that appears, select the **Sign In** button. A browser window opens, and you're prompted to sign in.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-desktop-app-maui-sample-sign-in/maui-desktop-sign-in-prompt.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot of user prompt to enter credential in desktop application.":::

   During the sign in process, you're prompted to grant various permissions (to allow the application to access your data). Upon successful sign in and consent, the application screen displays the main page.

# Register an app in your external tenant

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-external-only](../includes/applies-to-external-only.md)]

Microsoft Entra External ID enables your organization to manage customers’ identities, and securely control access to your public facing applications and APIs. Applications where your customers can buy your products, subscribe to your services, or access their account and data.  Your customers only need to sign in on a device or a web browser once and have access to all your applications you granted them permissions.

To enable your application to sign in with External ID, you need to register your app with External ID. The app registration establishes a trust relationship between the app and External ID.
During app registration, you specify the redirect URI. The redirect URI is the endpoint to which users are redirected by External ID after they authenticate. The app registration process generates an application ID, also known as the client ID, that uniquely identifies your app.

External ID supports authentication for various modern application architectures, for example web app or single-page app. The interaction of each application type with the external tenant is different, therefore, you must specify the type of application you want to register.

In this article, you learn how to register an application in your external tenant.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account that has an active subscription. <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F" target="_blank">Create an account for free</a>.
- Your external tenant. If you don't already have one, sign up for a <a href="https://aka.ms/ciam-free-trial?wt.mc_id=ciamcustomertenantfreetrial_linkclick_content_cnl" target="_blank">free trial</a>.

## Choose your app type

# [Single-page app (SPA)](#tab/spa)
## Register your Single-page app

External ID supports authentication for Single-page apps (SPAs).

The following steps show you how to register your SPA in the Microsoft Entra admin center:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least an [Application Developer](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#application-developer).

1. If you have access to multiple tenants, use the **Settings** icon :::image type="icon" source="media/common/admin-center-settings-icon.png" border="false"::: in the top menu to switch to your external tenant from the **Directories + subscriptions** menu.

1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **App registrations**.

1. Select **+ New registration**.

1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
    
    1. In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that is displayed to users of the app, for example *ciam-client-app*.
    
    1. Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.
	
	1. Under **Redirect URI (optional)**, select **Single-page application (SPA)** and then, in the URL box, enter `http://localhost:3000/`.

1. Select **Register**.

1. The application's **Overview pane** is displayed when registration is complete. Record the **Directory (tenant) ID** and the **Application (client) ID** to be used in your application source code.

### Grant admin consent

[!INCLUDE [grant permission for signing in users](../customers/includes/register-app/grant-api-permission-sign-in.md)] 

### Grant API permissions (optional):

If your SPA needs to call an API, you must grant your SPA API permissions so it can call the API. You must also [register the web API](how-to-register-ciam-app.md?tabs=webapi) that you need to call. 

[!INCLUDE [grant permissions for calling an API](../customers/includes/register-app/grant-api-permission-call-api.md)] 

If you'd like to learn how to expose the permissions by adding a link, go to the [Web API](how-to-register-ciam-app.md?tabs=webapi) section.

# Sign in with an alias or username (preview)

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-external-only](../includes/applies-to-external-only.md)]

You can allow users who sign in with an email address and password to also sign in with a username and password. The username, also called an alternate sign-in identifier, can be a customer ID, account number, or another identifier that you choose to use as a username.

## Prerequisites

- If you haven't already created your own Microsoft Entra external tenant, [create one now](how-to-create-external-tenant-portal.md).
- [Register an app](/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app)
- [Create a user flow](how-to-user-flow-sign-up-sign-in-customers.md)
- [Add your application](how-to-user-flow-add-application.md) to the user flow.

## Enable username in sign-in identifier policy

To enable username as a sign-in identifier, first enable the sign-in identifier policy in the Microsoft Entra admin center. UserPrincipalName (UPN) and email address are selected by default. Once username is also  enabled, users who have been assigned a username will be able to sign in using either their email address or username.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least an [Authentication Policy Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#authentication-policy-administrator).
1. If you have access to multiple tenants, use the **Settings** icon :::image type="icon" source="media/common/admin-center-settings-icon.png" border="false"::: in the top menu to switch to your external tenant from the **Directories + subscriptions** menu.
1. Browse to **Sign-in identifiers** either from **Entra ID** > **External Identities** or from **Entra ID** > **Authentication methods**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-sign-in-alias/sign-in-identifiers-option.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Sign-in identifiers option in the Microsoft Entra admin center.":::

1. On the **Sign-in identifiers** page, enable **Username** as a sign-in identifier.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-sign-in-alias/enable-username.png" alt-text="Screenshot of enabling username in the Sign-in identifiers option in the Microsoft Entra admin center.":::

1. Select **Save** at the top of the page.

### Enable custom username validation (optional)

You can also validate usernames against a custom regular expression. In the modal window, you can specify up to two regular expressions. There’s no built-in validation for custom regular expressions, apart from ensuring they don’t match the format of an email address. Authentication may fail at runtime if the provided value doesn’t match the regex or if the regex itself is invalid.

1. To enable custom username validation, select **Customize** and **Enable** and specify the regex patterns.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-sign-in-alias/enable-custom-username.png" alt-text="Screenshot of enabling custom username in the Sign-in identifiers option in the Microsoft Entra admin center.":::

1. Select **Save** at the bottom of the modal window.

## Create users with username in the admin center

You can create external users with both email address and username as sign-in identifiers using either the Microsoft Entra admin center or the Microsoft Graph API. This section describes creating users in the Microsoft Entra admin center.
 
1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least an [Authentication Policy Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#authentication-policy-administrator).
1. If you have access to multiple tenants, use the **Settings** icon :::image type="icon" source="media/common/admin-center-settings-icon.png" border="false"::: in the top menu to switch to your external tenant from the **Directories + subscriptions** menu.
1. In your external tenant, browse to **Entra ID** > **Users**.
1. Select **+ New user** > **Create external user**.
1. Next to **Identities**, enter values for both **Email** and **User Name** sign-in methods. The selection order doesn’t matter.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-sign-in-alias/sign-in-method-dropdown.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Sign-in method dropdown in the Create external user pane in the Microsoft Entra admin center.":::

1. On the **Properties** tab, specify the email attribute for the user.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-sign-in-alias/email-attribute.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Email attribute field in the Create external user pane in the Microsoft Entra admin center.":::

1. Select **Review + create** to create the user.

## Update existing users to add a username in the admin center

Follow these steps to add a username to an existing external user in the Microsoft Entra admin center. Username can only be added to external users with email and password accounts.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least an [Authentication Policy Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#authentication-policy-administrator).
1. If you have access to multiple tenants, use the **Settings** icon :::image type="icon" source="media/common/admin-center-settings-icon.png" border="false"::: in the top menu to switch to your external tenant from the **Directories + subscriptions** menu.
1. In your external tenant, browse to **Entra ID** > **Users**.
1. Select the external user you want to update.
1. In the user pane, select **Edit properties**.
1. On the **Identity** tab, in the **Identities** section select **+ Add identity**.
1. Select **User Name** from the dropdown and enter the username you want to assign to the user.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-sign-in-alias/edit-user-to-add-alias.png" alt-text="Screenshot of adding username to an existing user in the Microsoft Entra admin center.":::

1. Select **Save** to apply the changes.

## Create users with username with the Microsoft Graph API

After you sign in to the [MS Graph explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer), you can use the [Users API](/graph/api/user-post-users) to create users with both email address and username as sign-in identifiers. You can also use the Users API to [add a username](/entra/external-id/customers/how-to-sign-in-alias#add-a-username-to-an-existing-user-with-the-microsoft-graph-api) to an existing user.
The following request example shows how to create a user with both email address and username as sign-in identifiers.

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users
Content-type: application/json
{
    "displayName": "Test User",
    "identities": [
        {
            "signInType": "emailAddress",
            "issuer": "contoso.onmicrosoft.com",
            "issuerAssignedId": "dylan@woodgrove.com"
        },
        {
            "signInType": "username",
            "issuer": "contoso.onmicrosoft.com",
            "issuerAssignedId": "dylan123"
        }
    ],
    "mail": "dylan@woodgrove.com",
    "passwordProfile": {
        "password": "passwordValue",
        "forceChangePasswordNextSignIn": false
    },
    "passwordPolicies": "DisablePasswordExpiration"
}
```

## Add a username to an existing user with the Microsoft Graph API

You can also add a username to an existing external user.

### Step 1: Get the user details

Use `$filter` to get the user object, and `$select` to return the ID and `identities[]` properties. The following request example shows how to retrieve a user account using the email address as a sign-in identifier.

```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users?$select=displayName,id&$filter=identities/any(c:c/issuerAssignedId eq 'dylan@woodgrove.com' and c/issuer eq 'contoso.onmicrosoft.com')
```

The following response example shows the response with the user details.

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-type: application/json
 
{
  "value": [
    {
      "displayName": "Dylan Williams",
      "id": "00aa00aa-bb11-cc22-dd33-44ee44ee44ee"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 2: Update the user details

Once you have the user details from the query above, you can update the `identities[]` property of the user. You must replace the entire `identities[]` property of the user.

The following request example shows how to update the `identities[]` property of the user to add a username.

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/00aa00aa-bb11-cc22-dd33-44ee44ee44ee
Content-type: application/json
 
{
    "identities": [
        {
            "signInType": "emailAddress",
            "issuer": "contoso.onmicrosoft.com",
            "issuerAssignedId": "dylan@woodgrove.com""
        },
        {
            "signInType": "username",
            "issuer": "contoso.onmicrosoft.com",
            "issuerAssignedId": "dylan123"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Test signing in with the alias or username

You can test signing in with the email address and username you assigned to the user you created using the [Run user flow](how-to-test-user-flows.md) feature.

> [!NOTE]
> The `identities[]` property on a user object isn’t enforced by the Microsoft Entra sign-in identifiers policy. While administrators can assign values to a user’s `identities[]` property, authentication is determined by the configured sign-in identifier policy. In other words, if a sign-in type is specified for a user but isn't enabled in the policy, the authentication attempt fails at runtime. For example, a user might be assigned the username *User1234*, but if the username sign-in method isn't enabled in the policy, the user won't be able to sign in using that username.  

## Customize the sign-in page (optional)

You can customize the sign-in page to provide a better experience for your users. You can customize the hint text of the identifier field on the sign-in page and localize other strings related to username.

### Customize the hint text of the identifier field on the sign-in page

You can customize the hint text of identifier field on the sign-in page for all apps via Company Branding.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Organizational Branding Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#organizational-branding-administrator).
1. If you have access to multiple tenants, use the **Settings** icon :::image type="icon" source="media/common/admin-center-settings-icon.png" border="false"::: in the top menu to switch to the external tenant you created earlier from the **Directories + subscriptions** menu.
1. Browse to **Company branding** either by using the search bar or by navigating to **Entra ID** > **Custom Branding**.
1. Select **Edit** to modify the branding.
1. In the **Sign-in form** tab, you can customize the hint text of identifier field on the sign-in page. For example, you can change it to *Email address or Member ID*.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-sign-in-alias/edit-username-hint.png" alt-text="Screenshot of customizing the username hint text  in the Microsoft Entra admin center.":::

1. Select **Review + save** to save your changes.

### Customize and localize other strings related to username

You can customize and localize other strings related to an end user's experience of signing in with a username by uploading a language file. For more information, see [Add language customization to a user flow](/entra/external-id/customers/how-to-customize-languages-customers#add-language-customization-to-a-user-flow).

# Use Azure Front Door as a reverse proxy in production environment for a single-page app that uses native authentication (preview)

In this article, you learn how to Use Azure Front Door as a reverse proxy for a single-page app (SPA) that uses [native authentication API](/entra/identity-platform/reference-native-authentication-api?toc=%2Fentra%2Fexternal-id%2Ftoc.json&bc=%2Fentra%2Fexternal-id%2Fbreadcrumb%2Ftoc.json&tabs=emailOtp).

The native authentication API doesn't support Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). Therefore, a single-page app (SPA) that uses this API for user authentication can't make successful requests from front-end JavaScript code. To resolve this, you need to add a proxy server between the SPA and the native authentication API. This proxy server injects the appropriate CORS headers into the response.

In a production environment, we recommended using [Azure Front Door with a Standard/Premium subscription](/azure/frontdoor/standard-premium/troubleshoot-cross-origin-resources) as a reverse proxy.

## Prerequisites
- An Azure subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio).
- A sample SPA that you can access via a URL such as `http://www.contoso.com`:
    - You can use the React app described in [Quickstart: Sign in users into a sample React SPA by using native authentication API](quickstart-native-authentication-single-page-app-react-sign-in.md). However, don't configure or run the proxy server, as this guide covers that setup.
    - Once you run the app, record the app URL for later use in this guide. In production, this URL contains the domain that you want to use as a custom domain URL, such as `http://www.contoso.com`

## Set up Azure Front Door as a reverse proxy

1. Familiarize yourself how to use Azure Front Door with CORS by reading through the article at [Using Azure Front Door Standard/Premium with CORS](/azure/frontdoor/standard-premium/troubleshoot-cross-origin-resources).
1. Use the instructions in [Enable custom URL domains for apps in external tenants](how-to-custom-url-domain.md) to add a custom domain name to your external tenant and create an Azure Front Door.
1. In your sample SPA, open the *API\React\ReactAuthSimple\src\config.ts* file, then replace the value of `BASE_API_URL`, *http://localhost:3001/api*, with `https://Enter_Custom_Domain_URL/Enter_the_Tenant_ID_Here`. Replace the placeholder:
    1. `Enter_Custom_Domain_URL` with your custom domain url, such as `contoso.com`.
    1. `Enter_the_Tenant_ID_Here` with your Directory (tenant) ID. If you don't have your tenant ID, learn how to [read your tenant details](how-to-create-external-tenant-portal.md#get-the-external-tenant-details).
1. If necessary, rerun your sample SPA. 


## Guidelines for using Azure Front Door as a reverse proxy 

We recommend the following guidelines when you set up Azure Front Door as a reverse proxy to manage the CORS headers in a production environment:

### Restrict origins

When you configure Azure Front Door, only allow your SPA domain url, such as `https://www.contoso.com`, as origin. Avoid configurations that permit all origins, such as `*` which could lead to security vulnerabilities.

### Use simple requests

 Native authentication requests already meet all conditions of [simple requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#simple_requests):

- Uses `Http Method: POST`.
- Uses `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.
- Request doesn't require custom headers. 
- Request doesn't involve `ReadableStream` object in the request. 
- Request doesnâ€™t require usage of `XMLHttpRequest`.

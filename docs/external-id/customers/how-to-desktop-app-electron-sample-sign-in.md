# Sign in users in a sample Electron desktop application

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-external-only](../includes/applies-to-external-only.md)]

This how-to guide uses a sample Electron desktop application to show how to add authentication to a desktop application. The sample application enables users to sign in and sign out. The sample web application uses [Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL)](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/lib/msal-node) for Node to handle authentication.

In this article, you do the following tasks:

- Register a desktop application in the Microsoft Entra admin center. 

- Create a sign-in and sign-out user flow in Microsoft Entra admin center.

- Associate your web application with the user flow. 

- Update a sample Electron desktop application using your own external tenant details.

- Run and test the sample desktop application.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or another code editor.

- An external tenant. If you don't already have one, <a href="https://aka.ms/ciam-free-trial?wt.mc_id=ciamcustomertenantfreetrial_linkclick_content_cnl" target="_blank">sign up for a free trial</a>.

## Register desktop app

[!INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-register-app](./includes/register-app/register-client-app-common.md)]
[!INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-app-integration-add-user-flow](./includes/register-app/add-platform-redirect-url-electron.md)] 

## Grant admin consent

[!INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-grant-delegated-permissions](./includes/register-app/grant-api-permission-sign-in.md)] 

## Create a user flow

[!INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-app-integration-add-user-flow](./includes/configure-user-flow/create-sign-in-sign-out-user-flow.md)] 

## Associate the web application with the user flow

[!INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-app-integration-add-user-flow](./includes/configure-user-flow/add-app-user-flow.md)]

## Clone or download sample web application

To get the desktop app sample code, [download the .zip file](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-ciam-javascript-tutorial/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) or clone the sample web application from GitHub by running the following command:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-ciam-javascript-tutorial.git
```

If you choose to download the `.zip` file, extract the sample app file to a folder where the total length of the path is 260 or fewer characters.

## Install project dependencies

1. Open a console window, and change to the directory that contains the Electron sample app:

    ```powershell
    cd 1-Authentication\3-sign-in-electron\App
    ```
 
1. Run the following commands to install app dependencies:

    ```powershell
    npm install && npm update
    ```

## Configure the sample web app

1. In your code editor, open `App\authConfig.js` file.

1. Find the placeholder:
 
    1. `Enter_the_Application_Id_Here` and replace it with the Application (client) ID of the app you registered earlier.

    1. `Enter_the_Tenant_Subdomain_Here` and replace it with the Directory (tenant) subdomain. For example, if your tenant primary domain is `contoso.onmicrosoft.com`, use `contoso`. If you don't have your tenant name, learn how to [read your tenant details](how-to-create-external-tenant-portal.md#get-the-external-tenant-details).

## Run and test sample web app

You can now test the sample Electron desktop app. After you run the app, the desktop app window appears automatically:

1. In your terminal, run the following command:

    ```powershell
    npm start
    ```

1. On the desktop window that appears, select the **Sign In** or **Sign up** button. A browser window opens, and you're prompted to sign in.

1. On the browser sign-in page, type your **Email address**, select **Next**, type your **Password**, then select **Sign in**. If you don't have an account, select **No account? Create one** link, which starts the sign-up flow.

1. If you choose the sign-up option, after filling in your email, one-time passcode, new password and more account details, you complete the whole sign-up flow. You see a page similar to the following screenshot. You see a similar page if you choose the sign-in option. The page displays token ID claims.

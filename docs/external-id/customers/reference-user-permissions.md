# Default user permissions in external tenants

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-external-only](../includes/applies-to-external-only.md)]

A Microsoft Entra tenant in an *external* configuration is used exclusively for [Microsoft Entra External ID](overview-customers-ciam.md) scenarios. An external tenant provides clear separation between your corporate workforce directory and your customer-facing app directory. Furthermore, users created in your external tenant are restricted from accessing information about other users in the external tenant. By default, customers canâ€™t access information about other users, groups, or devices.

An external tenant can contain the following user types:

- **External users** are consumers and business customers of the apps registered in your external tenant. They have a local account, but authenticate externally. External users are limited to default user permissions and can't be assigned roles. They're typically created through self-service sign-up, but you can create them with the [Create new external user](~/fundamentals/how-to-create-delete-users.yml#create-a-new-external-user) option in the Microsoft Entra admin center or with Microsoft Graph.

- **Internal users** are users (typically admins) who authenticate internally and have assigned [Microsoft Entra roles](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md) in your external tenant. If you don't assign a role, they have default user permissions. You can create internal users with the [Create new user](~/fundamentals/how-to-create-delete-users.yml#create-a-new-user) option in the admin center or with Microsoft Graph.

- **Invited users** are users (typically admins) who sign in with their own external credentials and have assigned [Microsoft Entra roles](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md) in your external tenant. If you don't assign a role, they have default user permissions. You can invite users with the [Invite external user](~/fundamentals/how-to-create-delete-users.yml#invite-an-external-user) option in the admin center or with Microsoft Graph.

## Default permissions

The following table describes the default permissions assigned to a user in an external tenant, including:

- Users who use self-service sign-up
- Users who are created by administrators
- Users who are invited

| **Area** | **Customer user permissions** |
| ------------ | --------- |
| Users and contacts | - Read and update their own profile through the app profile management experience  <br>- Change their own password <br>- Sign in with a local or social account |
| Applications | - Access applications <br>- Revoke consent to applications |

## Microsoft Graph APIs and permissions

The following table indicates the API operations that enable customers to manage their profile information. The user ID or userPrincipalName is always the signed-in user's.

| User operation  | API operation                                           | Permissions required       |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Read profile    | [GET /me](/graph/api/user-get) or [GET /users/{id or userPrincipalName}](/graph/api/user-get)     | User.Read                  |
| Update profile  | [PATCH /me](/graph/api/user-update) or [PATCH /users/{id or userPrincipalName}](/graph/api/user-update) <br/><br/> The following properties are updatable: city, country, displayName, givenName, jobTitle, postalCode, state, streetAddress, surname, and preferredLanguage | User.ReadWrite             |
| Change password | [POST /me/changePassword](/graph/api/user-changepassword)   | Directory.AccessAsUser.All |

# Gain insights into your app users’ activity

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-external-only](../includes/applies-to-external-only.md)]

The Application user activity  feature under Usage & insights provides data analytics on user activity and engagement for registered applications in your tenant. You can use this feature to view, query, and analyze user activity data in the Microsoft Entra admin center. This can help you uncover valuable insights that can aid strategic decisions and drive business growth.

> [!TIP]
> [![Try it now](./media/common/try-it-now.png)](https://woodgrovedemo.com/#usecase=UserInsights)
> 
> To try out this feature, go to the Woodgrove Groceries demo and start the “Application user activity” use case.

## Supported scenarios

You can use the user insights feature for the following scenarios:
- **Tracking active users** - You want to determine the total number of active users in your tenant. This can help you assess the overall user engagement with your applications.
- **Monitoring new users added** - You want to track and identify how many users have been added to your tenant in the last month. This data is valuable for monitoring the growth of your user base.
- **Analyzing daily and monthly application sign-ins** - You want to gather data on the number of users who sign in to your applications on a daily and monthly basis. This can help you gauge user engagement over time and spot trends.
- **Assessing MFA usage success and failure** - You want to compare the multifactor authentication (MFA) usage success and failure rates for your applications. This can provide insights into the security and user experience of your authentication processes.


## Prerequisites

To access and view data from application user activity, you must have:
- A Microsoft Entra ID for [customers tenant](quickstart-tenant-setup.md).
- A [registered application(s)](how-to-register-ciam-app.md) with some sign-in and sign-up data.

<!-- Link here later how to access the application user activity reports in two ways. -->

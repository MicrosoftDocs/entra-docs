# Customize the neutral branding in your external tenant 

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-external-only](../includes/applies-to-external-only.md)]

After creating a new external tenant, you can customize the end-user experience. Create a custom look and feel for users signing in to your apps by configuring **Company branding** settings for your tenant. With these settings, you can add your own background images, colors, company logos, and text to customize the sign-in experiences across your apps.  
You can also create user flows programmatically using the Company Branding Graph API.

## Prerequisites

- If you haven't already created your own Microsoft Entra external tenant, create one now.
- [Register an application](how-to-register-ciam-app.md).  
- [Create a user flow](how-to-user-flow-sign-up-sign-in-customers.md)
- Review the file size requirements for each image you want to add. You may need to use a photo editor to create the right-sized images. The preferred image type for all images is PNG, but JPG is accepted.

## Branding elements

By default, Microsoft offers a neutral branding for your tenant that can be personalized to suit your company's specific requirements. This default branding doesn't include any pre-existing Microsoft branding. If the custom company branding fails to load, the sign-in page will automatically switch back to this neutral branding. Additionally, each custom branding property can be manually added to the custom sign-in page.  

You can customize this neutral branding with a custom background image or color, favicon, layout, header, and footer. You can also customize the sign-in form and add custom text to different instances or upload [custom CSS](~/fundamentals/reference-company-branding-css-template.md). 
The following image displays the neutral default branding of the tenant. You can find the numbered branding elements and their corresponding descriptions after the image.

1. Neutral background.
2. Favicon.
3. Banner logo.
4. Footer as a page layout element.
5. Footer hyperlinks, such as Privacy & cookies, Terms of use.

## How to customize the default sign-in experience

Before you customize any settings, the neutral default branding appears in your sign-in, sign-up and sign-out pages. You can customize this default experience with a custom background image or color, favicon, layout, header, and footer. You can also upload a [custom CSS](~/fundamentals/reference-company-branding-css-template.md). 

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Organizational Branding Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#organizational-branding-administrator).
1. If you have access to multiple tenants, use the **Settings** icon :::image type="icon" source="media/common/admin-center-settings-icon.png" border="false"::: in the top menu to switch to the external tenant you created earlier from the **Directories + subscriptions** menu.
1. Browse to **Company Branding** either by using the search bar or by navigating to **Home** > **Tenant overview** > **Customize branding**.

### To customize user attributes

For your tenant, you might have different requirements for the information you want to collect during sign-up and sign-in. The tenant comes with a built-in set of information stored in attributes, such as Given Name, Surname, City, and Postal Code. You can create custom attributes in your tenant using the  Microsoft Graph API or in the portal under the **Text** tab in **Company Branding**. 

1. On the **Text** tab select **Add Custom Text**.
1. Select any of the options:

      - Select **Attributes** to override the default values. 
      - Select **Attribute collection** to add a new attribute option that you would like to collect during the sign-up process.
      - Select **Sign in** to add custom text for the sign-in page.
      - Select **Sign up** to add custom text for the sign-in page.
      - Select **Sign-in/up one time code (SISU OTC)** to add a custom title.

      :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-customize-branding-customers/custom-text.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the company branding text tab." lightbox="media/how-to-customize-branding-customers/custom-text.png":::
 
1. Select **Next: Review** to review all your modifications. Then select **Save** if you'd like to save your changes or **Previous** if you want to continue customizing.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> In the external tenant, we have two options to add custom text to the sign-up and sign-in experience.  The function is available under each user flow during language customization and also under Company branding. Although we have two ways to customize strings (via Company Branding and via User Flows), both ways modify the same JSON file. The most recent change made either via User flows or via Company branding  will always override the previous one.

## Customize the sign-out experience

You don’t need to customize the sign-out experience for your external tenant. If you’ve customized your branding for the sign-in experience, the sign-out experience will automatically match the sign-in experience. If you haven’t customized the sign-in experience, the sign-out experience will match the default neutral branding in your external tenant.

## How to customize the tenant name

You can customize your tenant name in the Microsoft Entra admin center to replace the Microsoft banner logo in the neutral default sign-in experience. The new tenant name also appears in the verification email sent to the user.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-customize-branding-customers/tenant-name.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the tenant name." lightbox="media/how-to-customize-branding-customers/tenant-name.png":::

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/) as at least a [Organizational Branding Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#organizational-branding-administrator).
1. If you have access to multiple tenants, use the **Settings** icon :::image type="icon" source="media/common/admin-center-settings-icon.png" border="false"::: in the top menu to switch to the external tenant you created earlier from the **Directories + subscriptions** menu.

1. Edit the **Name** field.

5. Select **Save**.

## Customize your branding with the Microsoft Graph API

You can use the Microsoft Graph API to customize a few items programmatically. For example, you can use the API to upload a custom background image, change the color of the sign-in page, and add a custom logo. For more information, see the [update default branding](/graph/api/organizationalbranding-update) article.

# Add and manage admin accounts

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-external-only](../includes/applies-to-external-only.md)]

In Microsoft Entra External ID, an external tenant represents your directory of consumer and guest accounts. With an administrator role, work and guest accounts can manage the tenant.

## Prerequisites

- If you haven't already created your own Microsoft Entra external tenant, create one now. <!--(how-to-create-external-tenant-portal.md)-->
- Understand user accounts in Microsoft Entra External ID.
- Understand user roles to control resource access.

## Add an admin account

To create a new admin account, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Privileged Role Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#privileged-role-administrator).
1. If you have access to multiple tenants, use the **Settings** icon :::image type="icon" source="media/common/admin-center-settings-icon.png" border="false"::: in the top menu to switch to your external tenant from the **Directories + subscriptions** menu.
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Users** > **All users**.
1. Select **New user** > **Create new user**.
1. On the **New user** page, under **Select template**, select **Create user**.
1. Under **Identity**, enter information for this admin:
  
   - **User name**. *Required*. The user name of the new user. For example, `mary@contoso.com`.
   - **Name**. *Required*. The first and last name of the new user. For example, *Mary Parker*.
   - **First name**. The first name of the new user. For example, *Mary*.
   - **Last name**. The last name of the new user. For example, *Parker*.
   - **Groups**. *Optional*. You can add the user to one or more existing groups. You can also add the user to groups at a later time.
   - **Roles**: To add administrative permissions for the user, add them to a Microsoft Entra role. You can assign the user to one or more of the [administrator roles](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference) in Microsoft Entra ID.
   - **Settings**: Use the yes or no toggle to set **Block sign in**, and the select the admin's primary location in the **Usage location** list.

The admin is created and added to your external tenant.

1. If you have access to multiple tenants, use the **Settings** icon :::image type="icon" source="media/common/admin-center-settings-icon.png" border="false"::: in the top menu to switch to your external tenant from the **Directories + subscriptions** menu.

## Review administrator account role assignments

As part of an auditing process, you typically review which users are assigned to specific roles in your customer directory. Use the following steps to audit which users are currently assigned privileged roles.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Privileged Role Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#privileged-role-administrator).
1. If you have access to multiple tenants, use the **Settings** icon :::image type="icon" source="media/common/admin-center-settings-icon.png" border="false"::: in the top menu to switch to your external tenant from the **Directories + subscriptions** menu.
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Roles & admins** > **Roles & admins**.
2. Select a role, such as **User Administrator**. The **Assignments** page lists the users with that role.

## Delete an administrator account

To delete an existing user, you must have at least the [User Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#user-administrator) role assignment. [Privileged Authentication Administrators](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#privileged-authentication-administrator) can delete any user, including other admins. *User Administrators* can delete any non-admin user.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Privileged Authentication Administrators](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#privileged-authentication-administrator).
1. If you have access to multiple tenants, use the **Settings** icon :::image type="icon" source="media/common/admin-center-settings-icon.png" border="false"::: in the top menu to switch to your external tenant from the **Directories + subscriptions** menu.
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Users** > **All users**.
1. Select the user you want to delete.
1. Select **Delete**, and then **Yes** to confirm the deletion.

The user is deleted and no longer appears on the **All users** page. The user can be seen on the **Deleted users** page for the next 30 days and can be restored during that time. For more information about restoring a user, see [Restore or remove a recently deleted user using Microsoft Entra ID](~/fundamentals/users-restore.yml).

## Protect administrative accounts

It's recommended that you protect all administrator accounts with multifactor authentication (MFA) for more security. MFA is an identity verification process during sign in that prompts the user for a one-time passcode.

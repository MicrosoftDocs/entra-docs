Security groups manage user and computer access to shared resources. You can create a security group so that all group members have the same set of security permissions.

To create a security group, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a Groups Administrator.
1. If you have access to multiple tenants, use the **Settings** icon :::image type="icon" source="~/external-id/customers/media/common/admin-center-settings-icon.png" border="false"::: in the top menu to switch to your external tenant from the **Directories + subscriptions** menu. 
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Groups** > **All groups**.
1. Select **New group**.
1. Under **Group type** dropdown, select **Security**.
1. Enter **Group name** for the security group, such as *Contoso_App_Administrators*.
1. Enter **Group description** for the security group, such as *Contoso app Security Administrator*.
1. Select **Create**.

The new security group appears in the **All groups** list. If you don't see it immediately, refresh the page.

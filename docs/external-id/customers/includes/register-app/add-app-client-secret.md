Create a client secret for the registered application. The application uses the client secret to prove its identity when it requests for tokens.

1. From the **App registrations** page, select the application that you created (such as *ciam-client-app*) to open its **Overview** page.
1. Under **Manage**, select **Certificates & secrets**.
1. Select **New client secret**.
1. In the **Description** box, enter a description for the client secret (for example, *ciam app client secret*).
1. Under **Expires**, select a duration for which the secret is valid (per your organizations security rules), and then select **Add**.
1. Record the secret's **Value**. You'll use this value for configuration in a later step. The secret value won't be displayed again, and isn't retrievable by any means, after you navigate away from the **Certificates and secrets**. Make sure you record it.

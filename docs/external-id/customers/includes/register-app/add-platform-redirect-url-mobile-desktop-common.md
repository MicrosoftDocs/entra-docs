To specify your app type to your app registration, follow these steps:

1. Under **Manage**, select **Authentication**.
1. On the **Platform configurations** page, select **Add a platform**, and then select **Mobile and desktop applications** option.
1. For the **Custom redirect URIs** enter a URI with a unique scheme, then select **Configure**. For example, Electron desktop app's redirect URI looks something similar to `http://localhost` while that of a .NET Multi-platform App UI (MAUI) looks similar to `msal{ClientId}://auth`.

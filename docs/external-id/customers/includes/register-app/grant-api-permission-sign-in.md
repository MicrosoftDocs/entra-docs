1. From the **App registrations** page, select the application that you created (such as *ciam-client-app*) to open its **Overview** page.
1. Under **Manage**, select **API permissions**.
1. Under **Configured permissions**, select **Add a permission**.
1. Select **Microsoft APIs** tab.
1. Under **Commonly used Microsoft APIs** section, select **Microsoft Graph**.
1. Select **Delegated permissions** option.
1. Under **Select permissions** section, search for and select both **openid** and **offline_access** permissions.
1. Select the **Add permissions** button. 
1. At this point, you've assigned the permissions correctly. However, since the tenant is a customer's tenant, the consumer users themselves can't consent to these permissions. You as the admin must consent to these permissions on behalf of all the users in the tenant:

    1. Select **Grant admin consent for \<your tenant name\>**, then select **Yes**.
    1. Select **Refresh**, then verify that **Granted for \<your tenant name\>** appears under **Status** for both scopes.

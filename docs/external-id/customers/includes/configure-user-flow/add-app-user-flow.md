Although many applications can be associated with your user flow, a single application can only be associated with one user flow. A user flow allows configuration of the user experience for specific applications. For example, you can configure a user flow that requires users to sign in or sign up with email address.

1. On the sidebar menu, select **Identity**.
1. Select **External Identities**, then **User flows**.
1. In the **User flows** page, select the **User flow name** you created earlier, for example, _SignInSignUpSample_.
1. Under **Use**, select **Applications**.
1. Select **Add application**.
   <!--[Screenshot the shows how to associate an application to a user flow.](media/20-create-user-flow-add-application.png)-->
1. Select the application from the list such as *ciam-client-app* or use the search box to find the application, and then select it.

1. Choose **Select**.

## Configure custom claims provider

If you want to add claims from an external system into the token that is issued to your app, use a [custom claims provider](../../../../identity-platform/custom-claims-provider-overview.md). A custom claims provider is made up of a custom authentication extension that calls an external REST API to fetch claims from external systems. 

Follow the steps in [Configure a custom claim provider](/entra/identity-platform/custom-extension-tokenissuancestart-configuration?toc=/entra/external-id/toc.json&bc=/entra/external-id/breadcrumb/toc.json) to add claims from an external system into your security tokens.

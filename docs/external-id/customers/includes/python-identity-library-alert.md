> [!NOTE]
> This sample uses the [Python identity third-party library](https://identity-library.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The library isn't officially maintained by Microsoft but is recommended for your use. This library makes it easier to add authentication to your web app as it abstracts a lot of the MSAL Python details.

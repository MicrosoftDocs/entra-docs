### Use custom URL domain (Optional)

Use a custom domain to fully brand the authentication URL. From a user perspective, users remain on your domain during the authentication process, rather than being redirected to *ciamlogin.com* domain name.

Follow these steps to use a custom domain:

1. Use the steps in [Enable custom URL domains for apps in external tenants](../how-to-custom-url-domain.md) to enable custom URL domain for your external tenant.

1. Open *appsettings.json* file:
    1. Update the value of the `Instance` property to *https://Enter_the_Custom_Domain_Here/Enter_the_Tenant_ID_Here*. Replace `Enter_the_Custom_Domain_Here` with your custom URL domain and `Enter_the_Tenant_ID_Here` with your tenant ID. If you don't have your tenant ID, learn how to [read your tenant details](../how-to-create-external-tenant-portal.md#get-the-external-tenant-details). 
    1. Add `knownAuthorities` property with a value *[Enter_the_Custom_Domain_Here]*.
    
After you make the changes to your *appsettings.json* file, if your custom URL domain is *login.contoso.com*, and your tenant ID is *aaaabbbb-0000-cccc-1111-dddd2222eeee*, then your file should look similar to the following snippet:

```json
{
    "AzureAd": {
        "Instance": "https://login.contoso.com/aaaabbbb-0000-cccc-1111-dddd2222eeee",
        "TenantId": "Enter_the_Tenant_Id_Here",
        "ClientId": "Enter_the_Application_Id_Here",
        "KnownAuthorities": ["login.contoso.com"]
    },
    "Logging": {...},
  "AllowedHosts": "*"
}
```

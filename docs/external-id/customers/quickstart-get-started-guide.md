# Quickstart: Get started with our guide to run a sample app and sign in your users (preview)

In this quickstart, we'll guide you through customizing the look and feel of your apps in the external tenant, setting up a user and configuring a sample app in only a few minutes. With these built-in external configuration features, Microsoft Entra External ID can serve as the identity provider and access management service for your customers.

## Prerequisites

- An external tenant. If you don't already have one, <a href="https://aka.ms/ciam-free-trial?wt.mc_id=ciamcustomertenantfreetrial_linkclick_content_cnl" target="_blank">sign up for a free trial</a> or [create a tenant with external configurations in the Microsoft Entra admin center](quickstart-tenant-setup.md). 

## Customize your sign-in experience

When you set up an external tenant free trial, the guide will start automatically as part of the configuration of your new external tenant. If you created your external tenant with an Azure subscription, you can start the guide manually by following the steps below.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com). 
1. If you have access to multiple tenants, use the **Settings** icon :::image type="icon" source="media/common/admin-center-settings-icon.png" border="false"::: in the top menu to switch to your external tenant from the **Directories + subscriptions** menu.
1. Browse to **Home** > **Tenant overview**.
1. On the **Get started** tab, select **Start the guide**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-create-external-tenant-portal/guide-link.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to start the guide.":::

You can customize your customer's sign-in and sign-up experience in the external tenant. Follow the guide that will help you set up the tenant in three easy steps. First you must specify how would you like your customer to sign in. At this step you can choose between two options: **Email and password** or **Email and one-time passcode**. You can configure social accounts later, which would allow your customers to sign in using their [Google](how-to-google-federation-customers.md) or [Facebook](how-to-facebook-federation-customers.md) account. You can also [define custom attributes](how-to-define-custom-attributes.md) to collect from the user during sign-up.

If you prefer, you can add your company logo, change the background color or adjust the sign-in layout. These optional changes will apply to the look and feel of all your apps in this tenant with external configurations. After you have the created tenant, additional branding options are available. You can [customize the default branding](how-to-customize-branding-customers.md) and [add languages](how-to-customize-languages-customers.md). Once you're finished with the customization, select **Continue**.

## Try out the sign-up experience and create your first user

1. The guide will configure your tenant with the options you have selected. Once the configuration is complete, the button will change its text from **Setting up...** to **Run it now**.
1. Select  the **Run it now** button. A new browser tab will open with the sign-in page for your tenant that can be used to create and sign in users. 
1. Select **No account? Create one** to create a new user in the tenant.
1. Add your new user's email address and select **Next**. Don't use the same email you used to create your trial.
1. Complete the sign-up steps on the screen. Typically, once the user has signed in, they're redirected back to your app. However, since you havenâ€™t set up an app at this step, you'll be redirected to JWT.ms instead, where you can view the contents of the token issued during the sign-in process.
1. Go back to the guide tab. At this stage, you can either exit the guide and go to the admin center to explore the full range of configuration options for your tenant. Or you can **Continue** and set up a sample app. We recommend setting up the sample app, so that you can use it to test any further configuration changes you make

1. You've completed the process of creating a trial tenant, configuring the sign-in experience, creating your first user, and setting up a sample app. Select **Continue** to go to the summary page, where you can either go to the admin center or you can restart the guide to choose different options.

> [!NOTE]
> The next time you return to your tenant, you might be prompted to set up additional authentication factors for added security of your tenant admin account.

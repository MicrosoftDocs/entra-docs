# Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 enforcement for Microsoft Entra Domain Services

Microsoft is enhancing security by disabling TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1 as communicated on November 10, 2023. While the Microsoft implementation of TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 versions is not known to have vulnerabilities, TLS 1.2 or later versions provide improved security features, including perfect forward secrecy and stronger cipher suites. This change helps protect customer data and ensures compliance with industry standards.

Microsoft Entra Domain Services supports TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1, but they're disabled by default.
Domain Services will use the following retirement path for TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1:

1. Domain Services will remove the ability to disable the TLS 1.2 only mode. Customers who disable TLS 1.2 only mode can enable it. 
1. After Domain Services removes the ability to disable the TLS 1.2 only mode, customers can't enable or disable TLS 1.2 only mode. 

## How to migrate to TLS 1.2 only mode in Domain Services

Use the Azure portal:

1.	In the Azure portal, go to the Domain Services instance. 
2.	Go to the Security settings.
3.	If the TLS 1.2 only mode is set to **Disable**, the instance enables TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1.
4.	Set TLS 1.2 only mode to **Enable**, and then click **Save**.

This may take about 10 minutes to complete as domain security updates are enforced.


Use PowerShell:

1. Install the Az.ADDomainServices module:

   ```powershell
   Install-Module -Name Az.ADDomainServices
   ```

1. Connect to the Azure subscription:

   ```powershell
   Connect-AzAccount -Subscription aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e
   ```

1. Check the value of TLS 1.2 only mode:

   ```powershell
   Get-AzADDomainService -DomainSecuritySettingTlsV1
   ```

   If the value is **Disabled**, then the instance is compliant. If the value is **Enabled**, proceed to the next step.

1. To change the value from **Enabled** to **Disabled**, get the name of the Domain Services instance:

   ```powershell 
   Get-AzADDomainService -Name
   ```

1. Get the resource group name where the domain instance is located:

   ```powershell
   Get-AzADDomainService -ResourceGroupName
   ```

1. Update the value of TLS 1.2 only mode: 

   ```powershell
   Update-AzADDomainService -Name "name" -ResourceGroupName "resourceGroupName" -DomainSecuritySettingTlsV1 Disabled
   ```

   This command may take about 10 minutes to complete as domain security updates are enforced.

Troubleshooting

# How to migrate to Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 enforcement for Microsoft Entra Domain Services

Microsoft is enhancing security by disabling TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1 as communicated on November 10, 2023. While the Microsoft implementation of TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 versions isn't known to have vulnerabilities, TLS 1.2 or later versions provide improved security features, including perfect forward secrecy and stronger cipher suites. This change helps protect customer data and ensures compliance with industry standards.

Microsoft Entra Domain Services supports TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1, but they're disabled by default.
The following retirement path for TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1 is used for Domain Services:

1. Domain Services has removed the ability to disable **TLS 1.2 Only Mode**. Customers who disable **TLS 1.2 Only Mode** can enable it. 
1. Customers can't disable TLS 1.2 only mode once they have enabled it. 

You can use the Azure portal or PowerShell to enable **TLS 1.2 Only Mode**.

## Identify applications that use deprecated TLS versions

Before you enable **TLS 1.2 Only Mode**, it's important to identify applications that still use TLS 1.0 or 1.1, and update them or replace them with alternatives that support TLS 1.2. You can inspect TLS handshake versions from an administrative workstation by using network monitoring tools, such as Wireshark or Microsoft Message Analyzer.

## [**Azure portal**](#tab/portal)

1. In the Azure portal, search for **Domain Services**, and select your Domain Services instance. 
1. Select **Security Settings**.
1. If **TLS 1.2 Only Mode** is set to **Disable**, the instance enables TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1. Set **TLS 1.2 Only Mode** to **Enable**, and then click **Save**.

   This change may take about 10 minutes to complete as domain security updates are enforced.

## [**PowerShell**](#tab/powershell)


1. Install the Az.ADDomainServices module:

   ```powershell
   Install-Module -Name Az.ADDomainServices
   ```

1. Connect to the Azure subscription:

   ```powershell
   Connect-AzAccount -Subscription aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e
   ```

1. Update the value of **TLS 1.2 Only Mode** by executing these two commands:

   ```powershell
   $domainService = Get-AzADDomainService
   ```
   
   ```powershell
   Update-AzADDomainService -Name $domainService.Name -ResourceGroupName $domainService.ResourceGroupName -DomainSecuritySettingTlsV1 Disabled
   ```

   This command may take about 10 minutes to complete as domain security updates are enforced.

## Troubleshooting

- **Diagnostic events**: If an application fails after you migrate to **TLS 1.2 Only Mode**, it logs event 36871 in the Application logs in Windows Event Viewer with the following error message:

  `A fatal error occurred while creating a TLS <client/server> credential. The internal error state is 10013. The SSPI client process is <process ID>.`

- **Use application-level diagnostics**: Some apps provide logs or error messages when TLS handshakes fail. Look for errors related to unsupported protocols.

- If the steps to enable **TLS 1.2 Only Mode** fail, open an [Azure support request](/entra/fundamentals/how-to-get-support) for more troubleshooting help.

## Microsoft Entra Domain Services

|Name<br /><sub>(Azure portal)</sub> |Description |Effect(s) |Version<br /><sub>(GitHub)</sub> |
|---|---|---|---|
|[Microsoft Entra Domain Services managed domains should use TLS 1.2 only mode](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F3aa87b5a-7813-4b57-8a43-42dd9df5aaa7) |Use TLS 1.2 only mode for your managed domains. By default, Microsoft Entra Domain Services enables the use of ciphers such as NTLM v1 and TLS v1. These ciphers may be required for some legacy applications, but are considered weak and can be disabled if you don't need them. When TLS 1.2 only mode is enabled, any client making a request that is not using TLS 1.2 will fail. Learn more at [Harden a Microsoft Entra Domain Services managed domain](./secure-your-domain.md). |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.1.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Azure%20Active%20Directory/AADDomainServices_TLS_Audit.json) |
|[Microsoft Entra ID should use private link to access Azure services](/training/modules/design-implement-private-access-to-azure-services/). | Azure Private Link lets you connect your virtual networks to Azure services without a public IP address at the source or destination. The Private Link platform handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network. By mapping private endpoints to Microsoft Entra ID, you can reduce data leakage risks. Learn more at: [https://aka.ms/privateLinkforAzureADDocs](https://aka.ms/privateLinkforAzureADDocs). It should be only used from isolated VNETs to Azure services, with no access to the Internet or other services (M365). |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Azure%20Active%20Directory/PrivateLinkForAzureAD_PrivateLink_AuditIfNotExists.json) |

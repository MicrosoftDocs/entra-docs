# Create a Microsoft Entra Domain Services forest trust to an on-premises domain using Azure PowerShell

In environments where you can't synchronize password hashes, or you have users that exclusively sign in using smart cards so they don't know their password, you can create a one-way outbound trust from Microsoft Entra Domain Services to one or more on-premises AD DS environments. This trust relationship lets users, applications, and computers authenticate against an on-premises domain from the Domain Services managed domain. In this case, on-premises password hashes are never synchronized.

In this article, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a Domain Services forest using Azure PowerShell
> * Create a one-way outbound forest trust in the managed domain using Azure PowerShell
> * Configure DNS in an on-premises AD DS environment to support managed domain connectivity
> * Create a one-way inbound forest trust in an on-premises AD DS environment
> * Test and validate the trust relationship for authentication and resource access

If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create an account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Managed domain forests don't currently support Azure HDInsight or Azure Files. The default managed domain forests do support both of these additional services.

## Prerequisites

To complete this article, you need the following resources and privileges:

* An active Azure subscription.
    * If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create an account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* A Microsoft Entra tenant associated with your subscription, either synchronized with an on-premises directory or a cloud-only directory.
    * If needed, [create a Microsoft Entra tenant][create-azure-ad-tenant] or [associate an Azure subscription with your account][associate-azure-ad-tenant].

* Install and configure Azure PowerShell.
    * If needed, follow the instructions to [install the Azure PowerShell module and connect to your Azure subscription](/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell).
    * Make sure that you sign in to your Azure subscription using the [Connect-AzAccount][Connect-AzAccount] cmdlet.
* Install and configure MS Graph PowerShell.
   - If needed, follow the instructions to [install the MS Graph PowerShell module and connect to Microsoft Entra ID](/powershell/microsoftgraph/authentication-commands).
   - Make sure that you sign in to your Microsoft Entra tenant using the [Connect-MgGraph](/powershell/microsoftgraph/authentication-commands) cmdlet.
* You need [Application Administrator](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#application-administrator) and [Groups Administrator](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#groups-administrator) Microsoft Entra roles in your tenant to enable Domain Services.
* You need [Domain Services Contributor](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#contributor) Azure role to create the required Domain Services resources.

## Sign in to the Microsoft Entra admin center

In this article, you create and configure the outbound forest trust from a managed domain using the Microsoft Entra admin center. To get started, first sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com).

## Deployment process

It's a multi-part process to create a managed domain forest and the trust relationship to an on-premises AD DS. The following high-level steps build your trusted, hybrid environment:

1. Create a managed domain service principal.
1. Create a managed domain forest.
1. Create hybrid network connectivity using site-to-site VPN or Express Route.
1. Create the managed domain side of the trust relationship.
1. Create the on-premises AD DS side of the trust relationship.

Before you start, make sure you understand the [network considerations, forest naming, and DNS requirements](tutorial-create-forest-trust.md#networking-considerations). You can't change the managed domain forest name once it's deployed.

<a name='create-the-azure-ad-service-principal'></a>

## Create the Microsoft Entra service principal

Domain Services requires a service principal synchronize data from Microsoft Entra ID. This principal must be created in your Microsoft Entra tenant before you created the managed domain forest.

Create a Microsoft Entra service principal for Domain Services to communicate and authenticate itself. A specific application ID is used named *Domain Controller Services* with an ID of *6ba9a5d4-8456-4118-b521-9c5ca10cdf84*. Don't change this application ID.

Create a Microsoft Entra service principal using the [New-MgServicePrincipal](/powershell/module/microsoft.graph.applications/new-mgserviceprincipal) cmdlet:


```powershell
New-MgServicePrincipal
```

## Create a managed domain 

To create a managed domain, you use the `New-AaddsResourceForest` script. This script is part of a wider set of commands that support managed domains, including create the one-way bound forest in a following section. These scripts are available from the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/) and are digitally signed by the Microsoft Entra engineering team.

1. First, create a resource group using the [New-AzResourceGroup][New-AzResourceGroup] cmdlet. In the following example, the resource group is named *myResourceGroup* and is created in the *westus* region. Use your own name and desired region:

    ```azurepowershell
    New-AzResourceGroup `
      -Name "myResourceGroup" `
      -Location "WestUS"
    ```

1. Install the `New-AaddsResourceForest` script from the [PowerShell Gallery][powershell-gallery] using the [Install-Script][Install-Script] cmdlet:

    ```powershell
    Install-Script -Name New-AaddsResourceForest
    ```

1. Review the following parameters needed for the `New-AaddsResourceForest` script. Make sure you also have the prerequisite **Azure PowerShell** and **Microsoft Graph PowerShell** modules. Make sure you have planned the virtual network requirements to provide application and on-premises connectivity.

    | Name                         | Script parameter          | Description |
    |:-----------------------------|---------------------------|:------------|
    | Subscription                 | *-azureSubscriptionId*    | Subscription ID used for Domain Services billing. You can get the list of subscriptions using the [Get-AzureRMSubscription][Get-AzureRMSubscription] cmdlet. |
    | Resource Group               | *-aaddsResourceGroupName* | Name of the resource group for the managed domain and associated resources. |
    | Location                     | *-aaddsLocation*          | The Azure region to host your managed domain. For available regions, see [supported regions for Domain Services.](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=active-directory-ds&regions=all) |
    | Domain Services administrator    | *-aaddsAdminUser*         | The user principal name of the first managed domain administrator. This account must be an existing cloud user account in your Microsoft Entra ID. The user, and the user running the script, are added to the *AAD DC Administrators* group. |
    | Domain Services domain name      | *-aaddsDomainName*        | The FQDN of the managed domain, based on the previous guidance on how to choose a forest name. |

    The `New-AaddsResourceForest` script can create the Azure virtual network and Domain Services subnet if these resources don't already exist. The script can optionally create the workload subnets, when specified:

    | Name                              | Script parameter                  | Description |
    |:----------------------------------|:----------------------------------|:------------|
    | Virtual network name              | *-aaddsVnetName*                  | Name of the virtual network for the managed domain.|
    | Address space                     | *-aaddsVnetCIDRAddressSpace*      | Virtual network's address range in CIDR notation (if creating the virtual network).|
    | Domain Services subnet name           | *-aaddsSubnetName*                | Name of the subnet of the *aaddsVnetName* virtual network hosting the managed domain. Don't deploy your own VMs and workloads into this subnet. |
    | Domain Services address range         | *-aaddsSubnetCIDRAddressRange*    | Subnet address range in CIDR notation for the Domain Services instance, such as *192.168.1.0/24*. Address range must be contained by the address range of the virtual network, and different from other subnets. |
    | Workload subnet name (optional)   | *-workloadSubnetName*             | Optional name of a subnet in the *aaddsVnetName* virtual network to create for your own application workloads. VMs and applications and also be connected to a peered Azure virtual network instead. |
    | Workload address range (optional) | *-workloadSubnetCIDRAddressRange* | Optional subnet address range in CIDR notation for application workload, such as *192.168.2.0/24*. Address range must be contained by the address range of the virtual network, and different from other subnets.|

1. Now create a managed domain forest using the `New-AaddsResourceForest` script. The following example creates a forest named *addscontoso.com* and creates a workload subnet. Provide your own parameter names and IP address ranges or existing virtual networks.

    ```powershell
    New-AzureAaddsForest `
        -azureSubscriptionId <subscriptionId> `
        -aaddsResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" `
        -aaddsLocation "WestUS" `
        -aaddsAdminUser "contosoadmin@contoso.com" `
        -aaddsDomainName "aaddscontoso.com" `
        -aaddsVnetName "myVnet" `
        -aaddsVnetCIDRAddressSpace "192.168.0.0/16" `
        -aaddsSubnetName "AzureADDS" `
        -aaddsSubnetCIDRAddressRange "192.168.1.0/24" `
        -workloadSubnetName "myWorkloads" `
        -workloadSubnetCIDRAddressRange "192.168.2.0/24"
    ```

    It takes quite some time to create the managed domain forest and supporting resources. Allow the script to complete. Continue on to the next section to configure your on-premises network connectivity while the Microsoft Entra forest provisions in the background.

## Configure and validate network settings

As the managed domain continues to deploy, configure and validate the hybrid network connectivity to the on-premises datacenter. You also need a management VM to use with the managed domain for regular maintenance. Some of the hybrid connectivity may already exist in your environment, or you may need to work with others in your team to configure the connections.

Before you start, make sure you understand the [network considerations and recommendations](tutorial-create-forest-trust.md#networking-considerations).

1. Create the hybrid connectivity to your on-premises network to Azure using an Azure VPN or Azure ExpressRoute connection. The hybrid network configuration is beyond the scope of this documentation, and may already exist in your environment. For details on specific scenarios, see the following articles:

    * [Azure Site-to-Site VPN](/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways).
    * [Azure ExpressRoute Overview](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction).

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If you create the connection directly to your managed domain's virtual network, use a separate gateway subnet. Don't create the gateway in the managed domain's subnet.

1. To administer a managed domain, you create a management VM, join it to the managed domain, and install the required AD DS management tools.

    While the managed domain is being deployed, [create a Windows Server VM](./join-windows-vm.md) then [install the core AD DS management tools](./tutorial-create-management-vm.md) to install the needed management tools. Wait to join the management VM to the managed domain until one of the following steps after the domain is successfully deployed.

1. Validate network connectivity between your on-premises network and the Azure virtual network.

    * Confirm that your on-premises domain controller can connect to the managed VM using `ping` or remote desktop, for example.
    * Verify that your management VM can connect to your on-premises domain controllers, again using a utility such as `ping`.

1. In the Microsoft Entra admin center, search for and select **Microsoft Entra Domain Services**. Choose your managed domain, such as *aaddscontoso.com* and wait for the status to report as **Running**.

    When running, [update DNS settings for the Azure virtual network](tutorial-create-instance.md#update-dns-settings-for-the-azure-virtual-network) and then [enable user accounts for Domain Services](tutorial-create-instance.md#enable-user-accounts-for-azure-ad-ds) to finalize the configurations for your managed domain.

1. Make a note of the DNS addresses shown on the overview page. You need these addresses when you configure the on-premises Active Directory side of the trust relationship in a following section.
1. Restart the management VM for it to receive the new DNS settings, then [join the VM to the managed domain](join-windows-vm.md#join-the-vm-to-the-managed-domain).
1. After the management VM is joined to the managed domain, connect again using remote desktop.

    From a command prompt, use `nslookup` and the managed domain name to validate name resolution for the forest.

    ```console
    nslookup aaddscontoso.com
    ```

    The command should return two IP addresses for the forest.

## Create the forest trust

The forest trust has two parts - the one-way outbound forest trust in the managed domain, and the one-way inbound forest trust in the on-premises AD DS forest. You manually create both sides of this trust relationship. When both sides are created, users and resources can successfully authenticate using the forest trust. A managed domain supports up to five one-way outbound forest trusts to on-premises forests.

### Create the managed domain side of the trust relationship

Use the `Add-AaddsResourceForestTrust` script to create the managed domain side of the trust relationship. First, install the `Add-AaddsResourceForestTrust` script from the [PowerShell Gallery][powershell-gallery] using the [Install-Script][Install-Script] cmdlet:

```powershell
Install-Script -Name Add-AaddsResourceForestTrust
```

Now provide the script the following information:

| Name                               | Script parameter     | Description |
|:-----------------------------------|:---------------------|:------------|
| Domain Services domain name            | *-ManagedDomainFqdn* | FQDN of the managed domain, such as *aaddscontoso.com* |
| On-premises AD DS domain name      | *-TrustFqdn*         | The FQDN of the trusted forest, such as *onprem.contoso.com* |
| Trust friendly name                | *-TrustFriendlyName* | Friendly name of the trust relationship. |
| On-premises AD DS DNS IP addresses | *-TrustDnsIPs*       | A comma-delimited list of DNS server IPv4 addresses for the trusted domain listed. |
| Trust password                     | *-TrustPassword*     | A complex password for the trust relationship. This password is also entered when creating the one-way inbound trust in the on-premises AD DS. |
| Credentials                        | *-Credentials*       | The credentials used to authenticate to Azure. The user must be in the *AAD DC Administrators group*. If not provided, the script prompts for authentication. |

The following example creates a trust relationship named *myAzureADDSTrust* to *onprem.contoso.com*. Use your own parameter names and passwords:.

```azurepowershell
Add-AaddsResourceForestTrust `
    -ManagedDomainFqdn "aaddscontoso.com" `
    -TrustFqdn "onprem.contoso.com" `
    -TrustFriendlyName "myAzureADDSTrust" `
    -TrustDnsIPs "10.0.1.10,10.0.1.11" `
    -TrustPassword <complexPassword>
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remember your trust password. You must use the same password when your create the on-premises side of the trust.

## Configure DNS in the on-premises domain

To correctly resolve the managed domain from the on-premises environment, you may need to add forwarders to the existing DNS servers. If you haven't configure the on-premises environment to communicate with the managed domain, complete the following steps from a management workstation for the on-premises AD DS domain:

1. Select **Start | Administrative Tools | DNS**
1. Right-select DNS server, such as *myAD01*, select **Properties**
1. Choose **Forwarders**, then **Edit** to add additional forwarders.
1. Add the IP addresses of the managed domain, such as *10.0.1.4* and *10.0.1.5*.
1. From a local command prompt, validate name resolution using **nslookup** of the managed domain name. For example, `Nslookup aaddscontoso.com` should return the two IP addresses for the  managed domain.

## Create inbound forest trust in the on-premises domain

The on-premises AD DS domain needs an incoming forest trust for the managed domain. This trust must be manually created in the on-premises AD DS domain, it can't be created from the Microsoft Entra admin center.

To configure inbound trust on the on-premises AD DS domain, complete the following steps from a management workstation for the on-premises AD DS domain:

1. Select **Start | Administrative Tools | Active Directory Domains and Trusts**
1. Right-select domain, such as *onprem.contoso.com*, select **Properties**
1. Choose **Trusts** tab, then **New Trust**
1. Enter the name of the managed domain, such as *aaddscontoso.com*, then select **Next**
1. Select the option to create a **Forest trust**, then to create a **One way: incoming** trust.
1. Choose to create the trust for **This domain only**. In the next step, you create the trust in the Microsoft Entra admin center for the managed domain.
1. Choose to use **Forest-wide authentication**, then enter and confirm a trust password. This same password is also entered in the Microsoft Entra admin center in the next section.
1. Step through the next few windows with default options, then choose the option for **No, do not confirm the outgoing trust**. You can't validate the trust relation because your delegated admin account to the managed domain doesn't have the required permissions. This behavior is by design.
1. Select **Finish**

## Validate resource authentication

The following common scenarios let you validate that forest trust correctly authenticates users and access to resources:

* [On-premises user authentication from the Domain Services forest](#on-premises-user-authentication-from-the-azure-ad-ds-forest)
* [Access resources in the Domain Services forest as an on-premises user](#access-resources-in-azure-ad-ds-as-an-on-premises-user)
    * [Enable file and printer sharing](#enable-file-and-printer-sharing)
    * [Create a security group and add members](#create-a-security-group-and-add-members)
    * [Create a file share for cross-forest access](#create-a-file-share-for-cross-forest-access)
    * [Validate cross-forest authentication to a resource](#validate-cross-forest-authentication-to-a-resource)

<a name='on-premises-user-authentication-from-the-azure-ad-ds-forest'></a>

### On-premises user authentication from the Domain Services forest

You should have Windows Server virtual machine joined to the managed domain resource domain. Use this virtual machine to test your on-premises user can authenticate on a virtual machine.

1. Connect to the Windows Server VM joined to the managed domain using Remote Desktop and your managed domain administrator credentials. If you get a Network Level Authentication (NLA) error, check the user account you used is not a domain user account.

    > [!TIP]
    > To securely connect to your VMs joined to Microsoft Entra Domain Services, you can use the [Azure Bastion Host Service](/azure/bastion/bastion-overview) in supported Azure regions.

1. Open a command prompt and use the `whoami` command to show the distinguished name of the currently authenticated user:

    ```console
    whoami /fqdn
    ```

1. Use the `runas` command to authenticate as a user from the on-premises domain. In the following command, replace `userUpn@trusteddomain.com` with the UPN of a user from the trusted on-premises domain. The command prompts you for the user's password:

    ```console
    Runas /u:userUpn@trusteddomain.com cmd.exe
    ```

1. If the authentication is a successful, a new command prompt opens. The title of the new command prompt includes `running as userUpn@trusteddomain.com`.
1. Use `whoami /fqdn` in the new command prompt to view the distinguished name of the authenticated user from the on-premises Active Directory.

<a name='access-resources-in-azure-ad-ds-as-an-on-premises-user'></a>

### Access resources in Domain Services as an on-premises user

Using the Windows Server VM joined to the managed domain, you can test the scenario where users can access resources hosted in the forest when they authenticate from computers in the on-premises domain with users from the on-premises domain. The following examples show you how to create and test various common scenarios.

#### Enable file and printer sharing

1. Connect to the Windows Server VM joined to the managed domain using Remote Desktop and your managed domain administrator credentials. If you get a Network Level Authentication (NLA) error, check the user account you used is not a domain user account.

    > [!TIP]
    > To securely connect to your VMs joined to Microsoft Entra Domain Services, you can use the [Azure Bastion Host Service](/azure/bastion/bastion-overview) in supported Azure regions.

1. Open **Windows Settings**, then search for and select **Network and Sharing Center**.
1. Choose the option for **Change advanced sharing** settings.
1. Under the **Domain Profile**, select **Turn on file and printer sharing** and then **Save changes**.
1. Close **Network and Sharing Center**.

#### Create a security group and add members

1. Open **Active Directory Users and Computers**.
1. Right-select the domain name, choose **New**, and then select **Organizational Unit**.
1. In the name box, type *LocalObjects*, then select **OK**.
1. Select and right-click **LocalObjects** in the navigation pane. Select **New** and then **Group**.
1. Type *FileServerAccess* in the **Group name** box. For the **Group Scope**, select **Domain local**, then choose **OK**.
1. In the content pane, double-click **FileServerAccess**. Select **Members**, choose to **Add**, then select **Locations**.
1. Select your on-premises Active Directory from the **Location** view, then choose **OK**.
1. Type *Domain Users* in the **Enter the object names to select** box. Select **Check Names**, provide credentials for the on-premises Active Directory, then select **OK**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You must provide credentials because the trust relationship is only one way. This means users from the managed domain can't access resources or search for users or groups in the trusted (on-premises) domain.

1. The **Domain Users** group from your on-premises Active Directory should be a member of the **FileServerAccess** group. Select **OK** to save the group and close the window.

#### Create a file share for cross-forest access

1. On the Windows Server VM joined to the managed domain, create a folder and provide name such as *CrossForestShare*.
1. Right-select the folder and choose **Properties**.
1. Select the **Security** tab, then choose **Edit**.
1. In the *Permissions for CrossForestShare* dialog box, select **Add**.
1. Type *FileServerAccess* in **Enter the object names to select**, then select **OK**.
1. Select *FileServerAccess* from the **Groups or user names** list. In the **Permissions for FileServerAccess** list, choose *Allow* for the **Modify** and **Write** permissions, then select **OK**.
1. Select the **Sharing** tab, then choose **Advanced Sharing…**
1. Choose **Share this folder**, then enter a memorable name for the file share in **Share name** such as *CrossForestShare*.
1. Select **Permissions**. In the **Permissions for Everyone** list, choose **Allow** for the **Change** permission.
1. Select **OK** two times and then **Close**.

#### Validate cross-forest authentication to a resource

1. Sign in a Windows computer joined to your on-premises Active Directory using a user account from your on-premises Active Directory.
1. Using **Windows Explorer**, connect to the share you created using the fully qualified host name and the share such as `\\fs1.aaddscontoso.com\CrossforestShare`.
1. To validate the write permission, right-select in the folder, choose **New**, then select **Text Document**. Use the default name **New Text Document**.

    If the write permissions are set correctly, a new text document is created. The following steps will then open, edit, and delete the file as appropriate.
1. To validate the read permission, open **New Text Document**.
1. To validate the modify permission, add text to the file and close **Notepad**. When prompted to save changes, choose **Save**.
1. To validate the delete permission, right-select **New Text Document** and choose **Delete**. Choose **Yes** to confirm file deletion.

## Update or remove outbound forest trust

If you need to update an existing one-way outbound forest from the managed domain, you can use the `Get-AaddsResourceForestTrusts` and `Set-AaddsResourceForestTrust` scripts. These scripts help in scenarios where you want to update the forest trust friendly name or trust password. To remove a one-way outbound trust from the managed domain, you can use the `Remove-AaddsResourceForestTrust` script. You must manually remove the one-way inbound forest trust in the associated on-premises AD DS forest.

### Update a forest trust

In normal operation, the managed domain and on-premises forest negotiate a regular password update process between themselves. This is part of the normal AD DS trust relationship security process. You don't need to manually rotate the trust password unless the trust relationship has experienced an issue and you want to manually reset to a known password. For more information, see [trusted domain object password changes](concepts-forest-trust.md#tdo-password-changes).

The following example steps show you how to update an existing trust relationship if you need to manually reset the outbound trust password:

1. Install the `Get-AaddsResourceForestTrusts` and `Set-AaddsResourceForestTrust` scripts from the [PowerShell Gallery][powershell-gallery] using the [Install-Script][Install-Script] cmdlet:

    ```powershell
    Install-Script -Name Get-AaddsResourceForestTrusts,Set-AaddsResourceForestTrust
    ```

1. Before you can update an existing trust, first get the trust resource using the `Get-AaddsResourceForestTrusts` script. In the following example, the existing trust is assigned to an object named *existingTrust*. Specify your own managed domain forest name and on-premises forest name to update:

    ```powershell
    $existingTrust = Get-AaddsResourceForestTrust `
        -ManagedDomainFqdn "aaddscontoso.com" `
        -TrustFqdn "onprem.contoso.com" `
        -TrustFriendlyName "myAzureADDSTrust"
    ```

1. To update the existing trust password, use the `Set-AaddsResourceForestTrust` script. Specify the existing trust object from the previous step, then a new trust relationship password. No password complexity is enforced by PowerShell, so make sure you to generate and use a secure password for your environment.

    ```powershell
    Set-AaddsResourceForestTrust `
        -Trust $existingTrust `
        -TrustPassword <newComplexPassword>
    ```

### Delete a forest trust

If you no longer need the one-way outbound forest trust from the managed domain to an on-premises AD DS forest, you can remove it. Make sure that no applications or services need to authenticate against the on-premises AD DS forest before you remove the trust. You must manually remove the one-way inbound trust in the on-premises AD DS forest, too.

1. Install the `Remove-AaddsResourceForestTrust` script from the [PowerShell Gallery][powershell-gallery] using the [Install-Script][Install-Script] cmdlet:

    ```powershell
    Install-Script -Name Remove-AaddsResourceForestTrust
    ```

1. Now remove the forest trust using the `Remove-AaddsResourceForestTrust` script. In the following example, the trust named *myAzureADDSTrust* between the managed domain forest named *aaddscontoso.com* and on-premises forest *onprem.contoso.com* is removed. Specify your own managed domain forest name and on-premises forest name to remove:

    ```powershell
    Remove-AaddsResourceForestTrust `
        -ManagedDomainFqdn "aaddscontoso.com" `
        -TrustFqdn "onprem.contoso.com" `
        -TrustFriendlyName "myAzureADDSTrust"
    ```

To remove the one-way inbound trust from the on-premises AD DS forest, connect to a management computer with access to the on-premises AD DS forest and complete the following steps:

1. Select **Start | Administrative Tools | Active Directory Domains and Trusts**.
1. Right-select domain, such as *onprem.contoso.com*, select **Properties**.
1. Choose **Trusts** tab, then select the existing incoming trust from your managed domain forest.
1. Select **Remove**, then confirm that you wish to remove the incoming trust.

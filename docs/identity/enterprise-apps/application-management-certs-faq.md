# Application Management certificates frequently asked questions

This page answers frequently asked questions about managing the certificates for apps using Microsoft Entra ID as an Identity Provider (IdP).

## Is there a way to generate a list of expiring SAML signing certificates?

You can export all app registrations with expiring secrets, certificates, and their owners for the specified apps from your directory in a CSV file through [PowerShell scripts](app-management-powershell-samples.md).

## Where can I find the information about soon to expire certificates renewal steps?

You can find the steps [here](./tutorial-manage-certificates-for-federated-single-sign-on.md#renew-a-certificate-that-is-set-to-expire-soon).

## How can I customize the expiration date for the certificates issued by Microsoft Entra ID?

By default, Microsoft Entra ID configures a certificate to expire after three years when it's created automatically during SAML single sign-on configuration. Because you can't change the date of a certificate after you save it, you need to create a new certificate. For steps on how to do so, refer [Customize the expiration date for your federation certificate and roll it over to a new certificate](./tutorial-manage-certificates-for-federated-single-sign-on.md#customize-the-expiration-date-for-your-federation-certificate-and-roll-it-over-to-a-new-certificate).

> [!NOTE]
> The recommended way to create SAML applications is through the Microsoft Entra Application Gallery, which will automatically create a three-year valid X509 certificate for you. 

## How can I automate the certificates expiration notifications?

Microsoft Entra ID sends an email notification 60, 30, and 7 days before the SAML certificate expires. You might add more than one email address to receive notifications.

> [!NOTE]
> You can add up to 5 email addresses to the Notification list (including the email address of the admin who added the application). If you need more people to be notified, use the distribution list emails.

To specify the emails you want the notifications to be sent to, see [Add email notification addresses for certificate expiration](./tutorial-manage-certificates-for-federated-single-sign-on.md#add-email-notification-addresses-for-certificate-expiration).

There's no option to edit or customize these email notifications received from `aadnotification@microsoft.com`. However, you can export app registrations with expiring secrets and certificates through [PowerShell scripts](app-management-powershell-samples.md).

## Who can update the certificates?

The owner of the application or Application Administrator can update the certificates through Microsoft Entra admin center UI, PowerShell, or Microsoft Graph.

## I need more details about certificate signing options

In Microsoft Entra ID, you can set up certificate signing options and the certificate signing algorithm. To learn more, see [Advanced SAML token certificate signing options for Microsoft Entra apps](certificate-signing-options.md).

## What type of certificate can I use for configuring the SAML Certificate for single sign-on?

The recommendation for the SAML single sign-on certificate depends on your organization's security requirements and policies. 
If your organization has an internal certificate authority (PKI), using a certificate from the internal PKI can provide a higher level of security and trust. This is because the internal PKI is under the control of your organization and can be managed and monitored to ensure the security of the certificate.

On the other hand, if your organization doesn't have an internal certificate authority, using a certificate from an external certificate authority such as DigiCert can provide a higher level of trust and security. This is because external certificate authorities are trusted by many organizations and are subject to strict security and validation requirements.

## I need to replace the certificate for Microsoft Entra application proxy applications and need more instructions

To replace certificates for Microsoft Entra application proxy applications, see [PowerShell sample - Replace certificate in Application Proxy apps](~/identity/app-proxy/scripts/powershell-get-custom-domain-replace-cert.md).

<a name='how-do-i-manage-certificates-for-custom-domains-in-azure-ad-application-proxy'></a>

## How do I manage certificates for custom domains in Microsoft Entra application proxy?

To configure an on-premises app to use a custom domain, you need a verified Microsoft Entra custom domain, a PFX certificate for the custom domain, and an on-premises app to configure. To learn more, see [Custom domains in Microsoft Entra application proxy](~/identity/app-proxy/how-to-configure-custom-domain.md).

## I need to update the token signing certificate on the application side. Where can I get it on Microsoft Entra ID side?

You can renew a SAML X.509 Certificate [SAML Signing certificate](~/identity-platform/single-sign-on-saml-protocol.md).

## What is Microsoft Entra ID signing key rollover?

You can find more details [here](~/identity-platform/signing-key-rollover.md).

## How do I renew application token encryption certificate?

To renew an application token encryption certificate, see [How to renew a token encryption certificate for an enterprise application](howto-saml-token-encryption.md).

## How do I renew application token signing certificate?

To renew an application token signing certificate, see [How to renew a token signing certificate for an enterprise application](./tutorial-manage-certificates-for-federated-single-sign-on.md).

## How do I update Microsoft Entra ID after changing my federation certificates?

To update Microsoft Entra ID after changing your federation certificates, see [Renew federation certificates for Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Entra ID](~/identity/hybrid/connect/how-to-connect-fed-o365-certs.md).

## Can I use the same SAML certificate across different apps?

When it's the first time configuring SSO on an enterprise app, we do provide a default SAML certificate that is used across Microsoft Entra ID. However, if you need to use the same certificate across multiple apps that aren't the default Microsoft Entra ones, use an external Certificate Authority and upload the PFX file. The reason is that Microsoft Entra ID doesn't provide access to private keys from internally issued certificates.

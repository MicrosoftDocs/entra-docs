- One of the following roles: Global Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator.

```PowerShell

$servicePrincipal = Get-AzureADServicePrincipal -ObjectId $objectId
$tags = $servicePrincipal.tags
$tags += "HideApp"
Set-AzureADServicePrincipal -ObjectId $objectId -Tags $tags

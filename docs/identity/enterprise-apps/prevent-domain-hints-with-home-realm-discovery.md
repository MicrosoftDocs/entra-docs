#customer intent: As an administrator managing federated domains, I want to disable auto-acceleration sign-in for certain domains and applications, so that users can always use their managed credentials and have a consistent sign-in experience, improving security and reducing frustration.

# Disable auto-acceleration sign-in

Home Realm Discovery (HRD) policy offers administrators multiple ways to control how and where their users authenticate. The `domainHintPolicy` section of the HRD policy is used to help migrate federated users to cloud managed credentials like [FIDO](~/identity/authentication/howto-authentication-passwordless-security-key.md), by ensuring that they always visit the Microsoft Entra sign-in page and aren't auto-accelerated to a federated IDP because of domain hints. To learn more about HRD policy, see [Home Realm Discovery](home-realm-discovery-policy.md).

This policy is needed in situations where and admins can't control or update domain hints during sign-in.  For example, `outlook.com/contoso.com` sends the user to a sign-in page with the `&domain_hint=contoso.com` parameter appended, to auto-accelerate the user directly to the federated IDP for the `contoso.com` domain. Users with managed credentials sent to a federated IDP can't sign in using their managed credentials, reducing security, and frustrating users with randomized sign-in experiences. Admins rolling out managed credentials [should also set up this policy](#suggested-use-within-a-tenant) to ensure that users can always use their managed credentials.

## DomainHintPolicy details

The DomainHintPolicy section of the HRD policy is a JSON object that allows an admin to opt out certain domains and applications from domain hint usage.  Functionally, this tells the Microsoft Entra sign-in page to behave as if a `domain_hint` parameter on the sign-in request wasn't present.

### The Respect and Ignore policy sections

|Section | Meaning | Values |
|--------|---------|--------|
|`IgnoreDomainHintForDomains` |If this domain hint is sent in the request, ignore it. |Array of domain addresses (for example `contoso.com`). Also supports `all_domains`|
|`RespectDomainHintForDomains`| If this domain hint is sent in the request, respect it even if `IgnoreDomainHintForApps` indicates that the app in the request shouldn't auto-accelerate. This is used to slow the rollout of deprecating domain hints within your network – you can indicate that some domains should still be accelerated. | Array of domain addresses (for example `contoso.com`). Also supports `all_domains`|
|`IgnoreDomainHintForApps`| If a request from this application comes with a domain hint, ignore it. | Array of application IDs (GUIDs). Also supports `all_apps`|
|`RespectDomainHintForApps` |If a request from this application comes with a domain hint, respect it even if `IgnoreDomainHintForDomains` includes that domain. Used to ensure some apps keep working if you discover they break without domain hints. | Array of application IDs (GUIDs). Also supports `all_apps`|

### Policy evaluation

The DomainHintPolicy logic runs on each incoming request that contains a domain hint and accelerates based on two pieces of data in the request – the domain in the domain hint, and the client ID (the app). In short - "Respect" for a domain or app takes precedence over an instruction to "Ignore" a domain hint for a given domain or application.

- In the absence of any domain hint policy, or if none of the four sections reference the app or domain hint mentioned, [the rest of the HRD policy will be evaluated](home-realm-discovery-policy.md#priority-and-evaluation-of-hrd-policies).
- If either one (or both) of `RespectDomainHintForApps` or `RespectDomainHintForDomains` section includes the app or domain hint in the request, then the user is auto-accelerated to the federated IDP as requested.
- If either one (or both) of `IgnoreDomainHintsForApps` or `IgnoreDomainHintsForDomains` references the app or the domain hint in the request, and they’re not referenced by the “Respect” sections, then the request won't be auto-accelerated, and the user remains at the Microsoft Entra sign-in page to provide a username.

Once a user has entered a username at the sign-in page, they can use their managed credentials.  If they choose not to use a managed credential, or they have none registered, they are taken to their federated IDP for credential entry as usual.

## Prerequisites

To disable auto-acceleration sign-in for an application in Microsoft Entra ID, you need:

- An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't already have one, you can [create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- One of the following roles: Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator, or owner of the service principal.

- [Microsoft Graph PowerShell](/powershell/microsoftgraph/overview) module.

## Suggested use within a tenant

Admins of federated domains should set up this section of the HRD policy in a four-phase plan. The goal of this plan is to eventually get all users in a tenant to use their managed credentials regardless of domain or application, save those apps that have hard dependencies on `domain_hint` usage.  This plan helps admins find those apps, exempt them from the new policy, and continue rolling out the change to the rest of the tenant.

1. Pick a domain to initially roll this change out to.  This is your test domain, so pick one that may be more receptive to changes in UX (For example, seeing a different sign-in page). This ignores all domain hints from all applications that use this domain name. Set this policy in your tenant-default HRD policy:

::: zone pivot="graph-hrd"

```http
PATCH /policies/homeRealmDiscoveryPolicies/{id}

"DomainHintPolicy": { 
    "IgnoreDomainHintForDomains": [ "testDomain.com" ], 
    "RespectDomainHintForDomains": [], 
    "IgnoreDomainHintForApps": [], 
    "RespectDomainHintForApps": [] 
} 
```
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="powershell-hrd"

```powershell 
New-AzureADPolicy 
    -Definition @("{`"HomeRealmDiscoveryPolicy`":{`"DomainHintPolicy`": { `"IgnoreDomainHintForDomains`": [ `"testDomain.com`" ], `"RespectDomainHintForDomains`": [], `"IgnoreDomainHintForApps`": [], `"RespectDomainHintForApps`": [] } } }") 
    -DisplayName BasicBlockAccelerationPolicy 
    -Type HomeRealmDiscoveryPolicy
```
::: zone-end

2. Gather feedback from the test domain users. Collect details for applications that broke as a result of this change - they have a dependency on domain hint usage, and should be updated. For now, add them to the `RespectDomainHintForApps` section:

::: zone pivot="graph-hrd"

```http
PATCH /policies/homeRealmDiscoveryPolicies/{id}

"DomainHintPolicy": { 
    "IgnoreDomainHintForDomains": [ "testDomain.com" ], 
    "RespectDomainHintForDomains": [], 
    "IgnoreDomainHintForApps": [], 
    "RespectDomainHintForApps": ["app1-clientID-Guid", "app2-clientID-Guid] 
} 
```
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="powershell-hrd"

```powershell
New-AzureADPolicy 
    -Definition @("{`"HomeRealmDiscoveryPolicy`":{`"DomainHintPolicy`": { `"IgnoreDomainHintForDomains`": [ `"testDomain.com`" ], `"RespectDomainHintForDomains`": [], `"IgnoreDomainHintForApps`": [], `"RespectDomainHintForApps`": ["app1-clientID-Guid", "app2-clientID-Guid"] } } }") 
    -DisplayName BasicBlockAccelerationPolicy 
    -Type HomeRealmDiscoveryPolicy
```

::: zone-end

3. Continue expanding rollout of the policy to new domains, collecting more feedback.

::: zone pivot="graph-hrd"

```http
PATCH /policies/homeRealmDiscoveryPolicies/{id}

"DomainHintPolicy": { 
    "IgnoreDomainHintForDomains": [ "testDomain.com", "otherDomain.com", "anotherDomain.com"], 
    "RespectDomainHintForDomains": [], 
    "IgnoreDomainHintForApps": [], 
    "RespectDomainHintForApps": ["app1-clientID-Guid", "app2-clientID-Guid] 
} 
```
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="powershell-hrd"

```powershell
New-AzureADPolicy 
    -Definition @("{`"HomeRealmDiscoveryPolicy`":{`"DomainHintPolicy`": { `"IgnoreDomainHintForDomains`": [ `"testDomain.com`", "otherDomain.com", "anotherDomain.com"], `"RespectDomainHintForDomains`": [], `"IgnoreDomainHintForApps`": [], `"RespectDomainHintForApps`": ["app1-clientID-Guid", "app2-clientID-Guid"] } } }") 
    -DisplayName BasicBlockAccelerationPolicy 
    -Type HomeRealmDiscoveryPolicy
```

::: zone-end

4. Complete your rollout - target all domains, exempting those that should continue to be accelerated:

::: zone pivot="graph-hrd"

```http
PATCH /policies/homeRealmDiscoveryPolicies/{id}

"DomainHintPolicy": { 
    "IgnoreDomainHintForDomains": [ "*" ], 
    "RespectDomainHintForDomains": ["guestHandlingDomain.com"], 
    "IgnoreDomainHintForApps": [], 
    "RespectDomainHintForApps": ["app1-clientID-Guid", "app2-clientID-Guid] 
} 
```
::: zone-end


::: zone pivot="powershell-hrd"

```powershell
New-AzureADPolicy 
    -Definition @("{`"HomeRealmDiscoveryPolicy`":{`"DomainHintPolicy`": { `"IgnoreDomainHintForDomains`": [ `"*`" ], `"RespectDomainHintForDomains`": [guestHandlingDomain.com], `"IgnoreDomainHintForApps`": [], `"RespectDomainHintForApps`": ["app1-clientID-Guid", "app2-clientID-Guid"] } } }") 
    -DisplayName BasicBlockAccelerationPolicy 
    -Type HomeRealmDiscoveryPolicy
```

::: zone-end

After step 4 is complete all users, except those in `guestHandlingDomain.com`, can sign-in at the Microsoft Entra sign-in page even when domain hints would otherwise cause an auto-acceleration to a federated IDP.  The exception to this is if the app requesting sign-in is one of the exempted ones - for those apps, all domain hints are still accepted.

::: zone pivot="graph-hrd"

## Configuring policy through Graph Explorer

Manage the [Home Realm Discovery policy](/graph/api/resources/homerealmdiscoverypolicy) using [Microsoft Graph](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/graph-explorer).  

1. Sign in to Microsoft Graph explorer with one of the roles listed in the prerequisite section.
1. Grant the `Policy.ReadWrite.ApplicationConfiguration` permission.
1. Use the [Home realm discovery policy](/graph/api/resources/homerealmdiscoverypolicy) to create a new policy.
1. POST the new policy, or PATCH to update an existing policy.

    ```http
    PATCH /policies/homeRealmDiscoveryPolicies/{id}
    {
        "displayName":"Home Realm Discovery Domain Hint Exclusion Policy",
        "definition":[
            "{\"HomeRealmDiscoveryPolicy\" : {\"DomainHintPolicy\": { \"IgnoreDomainHintForDomains\": [\"Contoso.com\"], \"RespectDomainHintForDomains\": [], \"IgnoreDomainHintForApps\": [\"sample-guid-483c-9dea-7de4b5d0a54a\"], \"RespectDomainHintForApps\": [] } } }"
        ],
        "isOrganizationDefault":true
    }
    ```

Be sure to use slashes to escape the `Definition` JSON section when using Graph.  

`isOrganizationDefault` must be true, but the displayName and definition can change.

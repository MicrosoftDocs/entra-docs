# Problems signing in to a Microsoft application

Microsoft Applications (like Exchange, SharePoint, Yammer, and so on) are assigned and managed a bit differently than third-party SaaS applications or other applications you integrate with Microsoft Entra ID for single sign-on.

There are three main ways that a user can get access to a Microsoft-published application.

- For applications in the Microsoft 365 or other paid suites, users are granted access through **license assignment** either directly to their user account, or through a group using our group-based license assignment capability.

- For applications that Microsoft or a Third Party publishes freely for anyone to use, users may be granted access through **user consent**. This means that they sign in to the application with their Microsoft Entra work or school account and allow it to have access to some limited set of data on their account.

- For applications that Microsoft or a third-party publishes freely for anyone to use, users may also be granted access through **administrator consent**. This means that an administrator has determined the application may be used by everyone in the organization, so they sign in to the application with a Privileged Role Administrator account and grant access to everyone in the organization.

To troubleshoot your issue, start with the [General Problem Areas with Application Access to consider](#general-problem-areas-with-application-access-to-consider) and then read the Walkthrough: Steps to troubleshoot Microsoft Application access to get into the details.

## General Problem Areas with Application Access to consider

Following is a list of the general problem areas that you can drill into if you have an idea of where to start, but we recommend you read the walkthrough to get going quickly: Walkthrough: Steps to troubleshoot Microsoft Application access.

- [Problems with the user’s account](#problems-with-the-users-account)

- [Problems with groups](#problems-with-groups)

- [Problems with Conditional Access policies](#problems-with-conditional-access-policies)

- [Problems with application consent](#problems-with-application-consent)

## Steps to troubleshoot Microsoft Application access

Following are some common issues folks run into when their users can't sign in to a Microsoft application.

- General issues to check first

  - Make sure the user is signing in to the **correct URL** and not a local application URL.

  - Make sure the user’s account is **not locked out.**

  - Make sure the **user’s account exists** in Microsoft Entra ID. [Check if a user account exists in Microsoft Entra ID](#problems-with-the-users-account)

  - Make sure the user’s account is **enabled** for sign-ins. [Check a user’s account status](#problems-with-the-users-account)

  - Make sure the user’s **password is not expired or forgotten.** [Reset a user’s password](#reset-a-users-password) or [Enable self-service password reset](~/identity/authentication/tutorial-enable-sspr.md)

  - Make sure **multifactor authentication** isn't blocking user access. [Check a user’s multifactor authentication status](#check-a-users-multifactor-authentication-status) or [Check a user’s authentication contact info](#check-a-users-authentication-contact-info)

  - Make sure a **Conditional Access policy** or **Identity Protection** policy isn't blocking user access. [Check a specific Conditional Access policy](#problems-with-conditional-access-policies) or [Check a specific application’s Conditional Access policy](#check-a-specific-applications-conditional-access-policy) or [Disable a specific Conditional Access policy](#disable-a-specific-conditional-access-policy)

  - Make sure that a user’s **authentication contact info** is up to date to allow multifactor authentication or Conditional Access policies to be enforced. [Check a user’s multifactor authentication status](#check-a-users-multifactor-authentication-status) or [Check a user’s authentication contact info](#check-a-users-authentication-contact-info)

- For **Microsoft** **applications that require a license** (like Office365), here are some specific issues to check once you've ruled out the general issues above:

  - Ensure the user or has a **license assigned.** [Check a user’s assigned licenses](#check-a-users-assigned-licenses) or [Check a group’s assigned licenses](#check-a-groups-assigned-licenses)

  - If the license is **assigned to a** **static group**, ensure that the **user is a member** of that group. [Check a user’s group memberships](#check-a-users-group-memberships)

  - If the license is **assigned to a** **dynamic group**, ensure that the **dynamic group rule is set correctly**. [Check a dynamic group’s membership criteria](#check-a-dynamic-groups-membership-criteria)

  - If the license is **assigned to a** **dynamic group**, ensure that the dynamic group has **finished processing** its membership and that the **user is a member** (this can take some time). [Check a user’s group memberships](#check-a-users-group-memberships)

  - Once you make sure the license is assigned, make sure the license is **not expired**.

  - Make sure the license is **for the application** they're accessing.

- For **Microsoft** **applications that don’t require a license**, here are some other things to check:

  - If the application is requesting **user-level permissions** (for example “Access this user’s mailbox”), make sure that the user has signed in to the application and has performed a **user-level consent operation** to let the application access their data.

  - If the application is requesting **administrator-level permissions** (for example “Access all user’s mailboxes”), make sure that a Privileged Role Administrator has performed an **administrator-level consent operation on behalf of all users** in the organization.

## Problems with the user’s account

Application access can be blocked due to a problem with a user that is assigned to the application. Following are some ways you can troubleshoot and solve problems with users and their account settings:

- [Check if a user account exists in Microsoft Entra ID](#check-if-a-user-account-exists-in-azure-active-directory)

- [Check a user’s account status](#check-a-users-account-status)

- [Reset a user’s password](#reset-a-users-password)

- [Enable self-service password reset](#enable-self-service-password-reset)

- [Check a user’s multifactor authentication status](#check-a-users-multifactor-authentication-status)

- [Check a user’s authentication contact info](#check-a-users-authentication-contact-info)

- [Check a user’s group memberships](#check-a-users-group-memberships)

- [Check a user’s assigned licenses](#check-a-users-assigned-licenses)

- [Assign a user a license](#assign-a-user-a-license)

## Problems with application consent

Application access can be blocked because the proper permissions consent operation hasn't occurred. Following are some ways you can troubleshoot and solve application consent issues:

- [Perform a user-level consent operation](#perform-a-user-level-consent-operation)

- [Perform administrator-level consent operation for any application](#perform-administrator-level-consent-operation-for-any-application)

- [Perform administrator-level consent for a single-tenant application](#perform-administrator-level-consent-for-a-single-tenant-application)

- [Perform administrator-level consent for a multitenant application](#perform-administrator-level-consent-for-a-multitenant-application)

### Perform a user-level consent operation

- For any OpenID Connect-enabled application that requests permissions, navigating to the application’s sign-in screen performs a user level consent to the application for the signed-in user.

- If you wish to do this programmatically, see [Requesting individual user consent](~/identity-platform/permissions-consent-overview.md#user-consent).

### Perform administrator-level consent operation for any application

- For **only applications developed using the V1 application model**, you can force this administrator level consent to occur by adding “**?prompt=admin\_consent**” to the end of an application’s sign-in URL.

- For **any application developed using the V2 application model**, you can enforce this administrator-level consent to occur by following the instructions under the **Request the permissions from a directory admin** section of [Using the admin consent endpoint](~/identity-platform/permissions-consent-overview.md#administrator-consent).

### Perform administrator-level consent for a single-tenant application

- For **single-tenant applications** that request permissions (like those you're developing or own in your organization), you can perform an **administrative-level consent** operation on behalf of all users by signing in as a Privileged Role Administrator and clicking on the **Grant permissions** button at the top of the **Application Registry -&gt; All Applications -&gt; Select an App -&gt; Required Permissions** pane.

- For **any application developed using the V1 or V2 application model**, you can enforce this administrator-level consent to occur by following the instructions under the **Request the permissions from a directory admin** section of [Using the admin consent endpoint](~/identity-platform/permissions-consent-overview.md#administrator-consent).

### Perform administrator-level consent for a multitenant application

- For **multitenant applications** that request permissions (like an application a third party, or Microsoft, develops), you can perform an **administrative-level consent** operation. Sign in as a Privileged Role Administrator and select the **Grant permissions** button under the **Enterprise Applications -&gt; All Applications -&gt; Select an App -&gt; Permissions** pane (available soon).

- You can also enforce this administrator-level consent to occur by following the instructions under the **Request the permissions from a directory admin** section of [Using the admin consent endpoint](~/identity-platform/permissions-consent-overview.md#administrator-consent).

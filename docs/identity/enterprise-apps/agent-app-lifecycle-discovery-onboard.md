# Discover and onboard apps

The App lifecycle management agent discovers unmanaged private applications through Global Secure Access telemetry and provides suggestions to onboard them into Microsoft Entra for centralized management.

## Prerequisites

Before using the discovery and onboarding features, ensure you have:

- [Global Secure Access Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#global-secure-access-administrator)
- You're either a Global Administrator or a Hybrid Identity Administrator in Microsoft Entra ID
- Microsoft Entra Suite or Microsoft Entra Private Access licenses
- Microsoft Entra Private Access configured
- Global Secure Access (GSA) Quick access is configured: Follow the guidance on [How to Configure Quick Access for Global Secure Access](/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-configure-quick-access)
- Ensure network traffic flows through GSA for at least 24 hours for initial discovery
- Provisioned Security Copilot SCUs (Security Compute Units)

## Limitations

- Agent doesn't support private app discovery for tenants in Africa and Australia
- Network traffic must flow through Global Secure Access for application discovery
- Applications accessed directly without going through Global Secure Access aren't discovered

## How it works

The agent scans Global Secure Access telemetry to identify unmanaged private applications accessed in the last 30 days.

The agent performs these steps:

1. **Analyzes network traffic and identifies accessed application segment**: Reviews Global Secure Access network traffic logs to identify private applications users are accessing
1. **Identifies application segments**: Examines network segments and FQDNs to map traffic to specific applications
1. **Determines user access**: : Identifies which users accessed each application and their usage patterns
1. **Creates onboarding suggestions**: Generates suggestions for onboarding applications, incorporating appropriate user scoping based on usage data and generates an application name using a large language model (LLM) to align with organizational naming conventions. To determine the application name, the agent uses the LLM to analyze existing naming patterns, focus on descriptive elements and identifying service types through a combination of port, protocol, and initiate client process. The agent presents three style-consistent application name options that reflect the likely choices of a human administrator within the organization, with the default selected as the best match. For example: `filesrv.contoso.com`

## Review suggestions and agent logic

To review suggestions:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](../role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator)
1. Browse to **Agents** in the left menu.
1. Select the **App Lifecycle Management agent** card
1. Select **View details** to open the agent dashboard

### View discovery suggestions

In the agent dashboard:

1. Navigate to the **Suggestions** tab
1. Find suggestions with **Onboard** in the **Actions taken by agent** column
1. Select **Review suggestion** to view details

### Application discovery details

Each onboard suggestion contains:
- Application network segment information
- Total usage and number of accessing users
- User names and access patterns
- Three autogenerated informative application name options, best match selected by default. Customers can modify the application names.
- Suggested user assignment scope, based on the user that accessed the app. Customer can modify the agent user's assignment suggestion.

### View agent's full activity

To understand how the agent identified applications:

1. From the suggestion details, select **View agent's full activity**
1. Review the **Summary of agent activity** for the discovery process

## Apply suggestions

To onboard discovered applications:

### Configure and onboard applications

1. From the application discovery suggestion, select **Apply Suggestions**
1. The system redirects to the Global Secure Access Enterprise Application Creation page
1. Review the prefilled application data:
   - Application name
   - Network segments
   - User assignments

1. Modify the application configuration as needed:
   - Adjust the application name
   - Update user assignments
   - Configure network segments if needed

1. Select **Save** to create the enterprise application

### Verify onboarding

After onboarding:
1. Navigate to **Enterprise applications** in the Microsoft Entra admin center
1. Locate the newly created application
1. Verify the configuration matches your requirements
1. Test user access to ensure proper functionality

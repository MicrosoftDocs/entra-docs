# PowerShell sample: Export app registrations with expiring secrets and certificates

This PowerShell script example exports all app registrations with secrets and certificates expiring in the next X days. It also includes the ones that are expired, if you choose so. The script exports the app registrations along with their owners. It exports the data for the specified apps from your directory. The output is saved in a CSV file.

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](~/includes/azure-docs-pr/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

This sample requires the [Microsoft Graph PowerShell](/powershell/microsoftgraph/installation) SDK module.

## Script explanation

The script can be used directly without any modifications. The admin is asked about the expiration date and whether they would like to see already expired secrets or certificates or not.

The "Add-Member" command is responsible for creating the columns in the CSV file.
The "New-Object" command creates an object to be used for the columns in the CSV file export.
You can modify the "$Path" variable directly in PowerShell, with a CSV file path, in case you'd prefer the export to be non-interactive.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [Get-MgApplication](/powershell/module/microsoft.graph.applications/get-mgapplication?view=graph-powershell-1.0&preserve-view=true) | Retrieves an application from your directory. |
| [Get-MgApplicationOwner](/powershell/module/microsoft.graph.applications/get-mgapplicationowner?view=graph-powershell-1.0&preserve-view=true) | Retrieves the owners of an application from your directory. |

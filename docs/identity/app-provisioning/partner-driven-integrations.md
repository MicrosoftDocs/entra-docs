# Partner-driven provisioning integrations

The Microsoft Entra provisioning service allows you to provision users and groups into both [SaaS](user-provisioning.md) and [on-premises](on-premises-scim-provisioning.md) applications. There are four integration paths:

**Option 1 - Microsoft Entra Application Gallery:**
Popular third party applications, such as Dropbox, Snowflake, and Workplace by Facebook, are made available for customers through the Microsoft Entra application gallery. New applications can easily be onboarded to the gallery using the [application network portal](~/identity/enterprise-apps/v2-howto-app-gallery-listing.md). 

**Option 2 - Implement a SCIM compliant API for your application:**
If your line-of-business application supports the [SCIM](https://aka.ms/scimoverview) standard, it can easily be integrated with the [Microsoft Entra SCIM client](use-scim-to-provision-users-and-groups.md).

**Option 3 - Use Microsoft Graph:**
Many new applications use Microsoft Graph to retrieve users, groups and other resources from Microsoft Entra ID. You can learn more about what scenarios to use [SCIM and Graph](scim-graph-scenarios.md) in. 

**Option 4 - Use partner-driven connectors:**
In cases where an application doesn't support SCIM, partners have built [custom ECMA connectors](on-premises-custom-connector.md) and SCIM gateways to integrate Microsoft Entra ID with numerous applications. **This document serves as a place for partners to attest to integrations that are compatible with Microsoft Entra ID, and for customers to discover these partner-driven integrations.** Custom ECMA connectors and SCIM gateways are built, maintained, and owned by the third-party vendor.

## How-to add partner-driven integrations to this document
If you have built a SCIM Gateway and would like to add it to this list, follow the steps below. 

1. Review the Microsoft Entra SCIM [documentation](use-scim-to-provision-users-and-groups.md) to understand the Microsoft Entra SCIM implementation.
1. Test compatibility between the Microsoft Entra SCIM client and your SCIM gateway.

## Guidelines
* Add any new partners in alphabetical order.
* Limit your entries to 500 words.
* Ensure that you provide contact information for customers to learn more.
* To avoid duplication, only include applications that don't already have out of the box provisioning connectors in the [Microsoft Entra application gallery](~/identity/saas-apps/tutorial-list.md).

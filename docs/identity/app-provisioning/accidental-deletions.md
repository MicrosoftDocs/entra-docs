# Enable accidental deletions prevention in the Microsoft Entra provisioning service

::: zone pivot="app-provisioning"
The Microsoft Entra provisioning service includes a feature to help avoid accidental deletions. This feature ensures that users aren't disabled or deleted in an application unexpectedly.
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="cross-tenant-synchronization"
The Microsoft Entra provisioning service includes a feature to help avoid accidental deletions. This feature ensures that users aren't disabled or deleted in the target tenant unexpectedly.
::: zone-end

You use accidental deletions to specify a deletion threshold. Anything above the threshold that you set requires an admin to explicitly allow the processing of the deletions.

## Configure accidental deletion prevention

To enable accidental deletion prevention:

::: zone pivot="app-provisioning"
1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least an [Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications**.
1. Select your application.
1. Select **Provisioning** and then on the provisioning page select **Edit provisioning**.
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="cross-tenant-synchronization"
1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least an [Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **External Identities** > **Cross-tenant synchronization** > **Configurations** and then select your configuration.
1. Select **Provisioning**.
::: zone-end

1. Under **Settings**, select the **Prevent accidental deletions** check box and specify a deletion threshold.
1. Ensure the **Notification Email** address is completed.
    If the deletion threshold is met, an email is sent.
1. Select **Save** to save the changes.

When the deletion threshold is met, the job goes into quarantine, and a notification email is sent. The quarantined job can then be allowed or rejected. To learn more about quarantine behavior, see [Application provisioning in quarantine status](application-provisioning-quarantine-status.md).

## Recovering from an accidental deletion
When you encounter an accidental deletion, you see it on the provisioning status page. It says `Provisioning has been quarantined. See quarantine details for more information`.

You can select either **Allow deletes** or **View provisioning logs**.

### Allowing deletions

The **Allow deletes** action deletes the objects that triggered the accidental delete threshold. Use the procedure to accept the deletions.  

1. Select **Allow deletes**.
2. Click **Yes** on the confirmation to allow the deletions.
3. View the confirmation that the deletions were accepted. The status returns to healthy with the next cycle.

### Rejecting deletions

Investigate and reject deletions as necessary:
- Investigate the source of the deletions. You can use the provisioning logs for details.
- Prevent the deletion by assigning the user / group to the application (or configuration) again, restoring the user / group, or updating your provisioning configuration.
- Once you've made the necessary changes to prevent the user / group from being deleted, restart provisioning. Don't restart provisioning until you've made the necessary changes to prevent the users / groups from being deleted. 


### Test deletion prevention
You can test the feature by triggering disable / deletion events by setting the threshold to a low number, for example 3, and then changing scoping filters, unassigning users, and deleting users from the directory (see common scenarios in next section). 

Let the provisioning job run (20 – 40 mins) and navigate back to the provisioning page. Check the provisioning job in quarantine and choose to allow the deletions or review the provisioning logs to understand why the deletions occurred.

## Common deprovisioning scenarios to test
- Delete a user / put them into the recycle bin.
- Block sign in for a user.
- Unassign a user or group from the application (or configuration).
- Remove a user from a group that's provides them access to the application (or configuration).

To learn more about deprovisioning scenarios, see [How Application Provisioning Works](how-provisioning-works.md#deprovisioning).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What scenarios count toward the deletion threshold?
When a user is set for removal from the target application (or target tenant), it's counted against the deletion threshold. Scenarios that could lead to a user being removed from the target application (or target tenant) could include: unassigning the user from the application (or configuration) and soft / hard deleting a user in the directory. Groups evaluated for deletion count towards the deletion threshold. In addition to deletions, the same functionality also works for disables.

### What is the interval that the deletion threshold is evaluated on?
It's evaluated each cycle. If the number of deletions doesn't exceed the threshold during a single cycle, the “circuit breaker” isn't triggered. If multiple cycles are needed to reach a steady state, the deletion threshold is evaluated per cycle.

### How are these deletion events logged?
You can find users that should be disabled / deleted but haven’t due to the deletion threshold. 
Navigation to **Provisioning logs** and then filter **Action** with *StagedAction* or *StagedDelete*.

# Understand how expression builder in Application Provisioning works

You can use [expressions](functions-for-customizing-application-data.md) to [map attributes](./customize-application-attributes.md). Previously, you had to create these expressions manually and enter them into the expression box. Expression builder is a tool you can use to help you create expressions.

For reference on building expressions, see [Reference for writing expressions for attribute mappings](functions-for-customizing-application-data.md). 

## Finding the expression builder

In application provisioning, you use expressions for attribute mappings. You access Express Builder on the attribute-mapping page by selecting **Show advanced options** and then select **Expression builder**.

## Using expression builder

To use expression builder, select a function and attribute and then enter a suffix if needed. Then select **Add expression** to add the expression to the code box. To learn more about the functions available and how to use them, see [Reference for writing expressions for attribute mappings](functions-for-customizing-application-data.md).

Test the expression by providing values and selecting **Test expression**. For example, from the dropdown list, select the **mail** attribute. Fill in the value with the email domain that starts with the @ sign; for example, `@fabrikam.com`. Then select **Test expression** and the output of the expression test appears in the **View expression output** box.

When you're satisfied with the expression, move it to an attribute mapping. Copy and paste it into the expression box for the attribute mapping you're working on.

## Known limitations
* Extension attributes aren't available for selection in the expression builder. However, extension attributes can be used in the attribute mapping expression.

# Configuring Microsoft Entra ID to provision users into SAP ECC with NetWeaver AS ABAP 7.0 or later
The following documentation provides configuration and tutorial information demonstrating how to provision users from Microsoft Entra ID into SAP ERP Central Component (SAP ECC, formerly SAP R/3) with NetWeaver 7.0 or later. If you are using other versions of SAP R/3, you can still use the guides provided in the [Connectors for Microsoft Identity Manager 2016](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=51495) download as a reference to build your own template for provisioning. If you are using SAP S/4HANA or other SAP SaaS applications, follow the [tutorial to configure SAP Cloud Identity Services for automatic user provisioning](~/identity/saas-apps/sap-cloud-platform-identity-authentication-provisioning-tutorial.md) instead. For more information on the SAP integrations, see [manage access to your SAP applications](~/id-governance/sap.md).

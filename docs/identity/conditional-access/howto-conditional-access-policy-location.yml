  Conditional Access: Block access by location
introduction: |
  With the location condition in Conditional Access, you can control access to your cloud apps based on the network location of a user. The location condition is commonly used to block access from countries/regions where your organization knows traffic shouldn't come from. For more information about IPv6 support, see the article [IPv6 support in Microsoft Entra ID](/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/azure-ad-ipv6-support).

  > [!NOTE]
  > Conditional Access policies are enforced after first-factor authentication is completed. Conditional Access isn't intended to be an organization's first line of defense for scenarios like denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, but it can use signals from these events to determine access.

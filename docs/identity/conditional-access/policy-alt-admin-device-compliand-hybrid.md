# Require compliant device or Microsoft Entra hybrid joined device for administrators

Accounts that are assigned administrative rights are a target for attackers. Requiring users with these highly privileged rights to perform actions from devices marked as compliant or Microsoft Entra hybrid joined can help limit possible exposure.

More information about device compliance policies can be found in the article, [Set rules on devices to allow access to resources in your organization using Intune](/mem/intune/protect/device-compliance-get-started).

Requiring a Microsoft Entra hybrid joined device is dependent on your devices already being Microsoft Entra hybrid joined. For more information, see the article [Configure Microsoft Entra hybrid join](~/identity/devices/how-to-hybrid-join.md).

Microsoft recommends you require phishing-resistant multifactor authentication on the following roles at a minimum:

[!INCLUDE [conditional-access-admin-roles](../../includes/conditional-access-admin-roles.md)]

Organizations can choose to include or exclude roles as they see fit.

## User exclusions
[!INCLUDE [active-directory-policy-exclusions](~/includes/entra-policy-exclude-user.md)]

[!INCLUDE [active-directory-policy-deploy-template](~/includes/entra-policy-deploy-template.md)]

## Create a Conditional Access policy

The following steps help create a Conditional Access policy to require multifactor authentication, devices accessing resources be marked as compliant with your organization's Intune compliance policies, or be Microsoft Entra hybrid joined.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Conditional Access Administrator](../role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#conditional-access-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Conditional Access** > **Policies**.
1. Select **New policy**.
1. Give your policy a name. We recommend that organizations create a meaningful standard for the names of their policies.
1. Under **Assignments**, select **Users or workload identities**.
   1. Under **Include**, select **Directory roles** and choose at least the previously listed roles.
   
      > [!WARNING]
      > Conditional Access policies support built-in roles. Conditional Access policies are not enforced for other role types including [administrative unit-scoped](../role-based-access-control/manage-roles-portal.md) or [custom roles](../role-based-access-control/custom-create.md).

   1. Under **Exclude**, select **Users and groups** and choose your organization's emergency access or break-glass accounts.
1. Under **Target resources** > **Resources (formerly cloud apps)** > **Include**, select **All resources (formerly 'All cloud apps')**.
1. Under **Access controls** > **Grant**.
   1. Select **Require device to be marked as compliant**, and **Require Microsoft Entra hybrid joined device**
   1. **For multiple controls** select **Require one of the selected controls**.
   1. Select **Select**.
1. Confirm your settings and set **Enable policy** to **Report-only**.
1. Select **Create** to create to enable your policy.

[!INCLUDE [conditional-access-report-only-mode](../../includes/conditional-access-report-only-mode.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> You can enroll your new devices to Intune even if you select **Require device to be marked as compliant** for **All users** and **All resources (formerly 'All cloud apps')** using the previous steps. **Require device to be marked as compliant** control does not block Intune enrollment. 

### Known behavior

On Windows 7, iOS, Android, macOS, and some non-Microsoft web browsers, Microsoft Entra ID identifies the device using a client certificate that is provisioned when the device is registered with Microsoft Entra ID. When a user first signs in through the browser the user is prompted to select the certificate. The end user must select this certificate before they can continue to use the browser.

#### Subscription activation

Organizations that use the [Subscription Activation](/windows/deployment/windows-10-subscription-activation) feature to enable users to "step-up" from one version of Windows to another, might want to exclude the Windows Store for Business, AppID 45a330b1-b1ec-4cc1-9161-9f03992aa49f from their device compliance policy.

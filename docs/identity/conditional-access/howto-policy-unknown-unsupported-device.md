# Common Conditional Access policy: Block access for unknown or unsupported device platform

Users are blocked from accessing company resources when the device type is unknown or unsupported.

The [device platform condition](concept-conditional-access-conditions.md#device-platforms) is based on user agent strings. Conditional Access policies using it should be used with another policy, like one requiring device compliance or app protection policies.

## User exclusions
[!INCLUDE [active-directory-policy-exclusions](~/includes/entra-policy-exclude-user.md)]

[!INCLUDE [active-directory-policy-deploy-template](~/includes/entra-policy-deploy-template.md)]

## Create a Conditional Access policy

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Conditional Access Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#conditional-access-administrator).
1. Browse to **Protection** > **Conditional Access**.
1. Select **Create new policy**.
1. Give your policy a name. We recommend that organizations create a meaningful standard for the names of their policies.
1. Under **Assignments**, select **Users or workload identities**.
   1. Under **Include**, select **All users**
   1. Under **Exclude**, select **Users and groups** and choose your organization's emergency access or break-glass accounts.
1. Under **Target resources** > **Cloud apps** > **Include**, select **All cloud apps**.
1. Under **Conditions**, select **Device platforms**
   1. Set **Configure** to **Yes**.
   1. Under **Include**, select **Any device**
   1. Under **Exclude**, select **Android**, **iOS**, **Windows**, and **macOS**.
      > [!NOTE]
      > For the exclusion select any platforms that your organization knowingly uses, and leave the others unselected.
   1. Select, **Done**.
1. Under **Access controls** > **Grant**, select **Block access**, then select **Select**.
1. Confirm your settings and set **Enable policy** to **Report-only**.
1. Select **Create** to create to enable your policy.

After administrators confirm the settings using [report-only mode](howto-conditional-access-insights-reporting.md), they can move the **Enable policy** toggle from **Report-only** to **On**.

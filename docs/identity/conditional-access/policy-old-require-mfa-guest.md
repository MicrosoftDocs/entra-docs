# Require multifactor authentication for guest access

Require guest users perform multifactor authentication when accessing your organization's resources. Some organizations might be ready to move to stronger authentication methods for their guest users. These organizations might choose to implement a policy like the one described in the article [Require multifactor authentication strength for external users](policy-guests-mfa-strength.md).

## Create a Conditional Access policy

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Conditional Access Administrator](../role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#conditional-access-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Conditional Access** > **Policies**.
1. Select **New policy**.
1. Give your policy a name. We recommend that organizations create a meaningful standard for the names of their policies.
1. Under **Assignments**, select **Users or workload identities**.
   1. Under **Include**, select **All guest and external users**
   1. Under **Exclude**, select **Users and groups** and choose your organization's emergency access or break-glass accounts. 
1. Under **Target resources** > **Resources (formerly cloud apps)** > **Include**, select **All resources (formerly 'All cloud apps')**.
   1. Under **Exclude**, select any applications that don't require multifactor authentication.
1. Under **Access controls** > **Grant**, select **Grant access**, **Require multifactor authentication**, and select **Select**.
1. Confirm your settings and set **Enable policy** to **Report-only**.
1. Select **Create** to create to enable your policy.

      - question: |
          I activated the agent but see "Fail" in the activity status. What's happening?
        answer: |
          It's possible that the agent was enabled with an account that requires role activation with Privileged Identity Management (PIM). So when the agent attempted to run, it failed because the account didn't have the required permissions at that time. You are prompted to reauthenticate if PIM permission expired.
          
          You can resolve this issue by removing the agent, then enabling the agent again with a user account that has standing permissions for Security Copilot access. For more information, see [Assign Security Copilot access](/copilot/security/authentication#assign-security-copilot-access).

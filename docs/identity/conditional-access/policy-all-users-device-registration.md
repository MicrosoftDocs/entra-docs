# Require multifactor authentication for device registration

Use the [Conditional Access user action](concept-conditional-access-cloud-apps.md#user-actions) to enforce policy when users register or join devices to Microsoft Entra ID. This control provides granularity in configuring multifactor authentication for registering or joining devices instead of a tenant-wide policy that currently exists. Administrators can customize this policy to fit the security needs of their organization.

## User exclusions
[!INCLUDE [active-directory-policy-exclusions](~/includes/entra-policy-exclude-user.md)]

## Create a Conditional Access policy

> [!WARNING]
> If you use [external authentication methods](/entra/identity/authentication/how-to-authentication-external-method-manage), these are currently incompatible with authentication strength and you should use the **[Require multifactor authentication](concept-conditional-access-grant.md#require-multifactor-authentication)** grant control.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Conditional Access Administrator](../role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#conditional-access-administrator).
1. Browse to **Protection** > **Conditional Access** > **Policies**.
1. Select **New policy**.
1. Give your policy a name. We recommend that organizations create a meaningful standard for the names of their policies.
1. Under **Assignments**, select **Users or workload identities**.
   1. Under **Include**, select **All users**.
   1. Under **Exclude**, select **Users and groups** and choose your organization's emergency access or break-glass accounts.
1. Under **Target resources** > **User actions**, select **Register or join devices**.
1. Under **Access controls** > **Grant**, select **Grant access**.
   1. Select **Require authentication strength**, then select the built-in **Multifactor authentication** authentication strength from the list.
   1. Select **Select**.
1. Confirm your settings and set **Enable policy** to **Report-only**.
1. Select **Create** to create to enable your policy.

After administrators confirm the settings using [report-only mode](howto-conditional-access-insights-reporting.md), they can move the **Enable policy** toggle from **Report-only** to **On**.

> [!WARNING]
> When a Conditional Access policy is configured with the **Register or join devices** user action, you must set **Identity** > **Devices** > **Overview** > **Device Settings** - `Require Multifactor Authentication to register or join devices with Microsoft Entra` to **No**. Otherwise, Conditional Access policies with this user action aren't properly enforced. More information about this device setting can found in [Configure device settings](../devices/manage-device-identities.md#configure-device-settings).

### Block access to register or join devices outside of trusted networks and locations

Organizations might choose to incorporate known network locations known as **Named locations** in their Conditional Access policies. These named locations might include trusted IP networks like those for a main office location. For more information about configuring named locations, see the article [What is the location condition in Microsoft Entra Conditional Access?](concept-assignment-network.md#ipv4-and-ipv6-address-ranges)

**In addition to** the previous example policy, an organization might choose to **block access** to register or join devices that aren't in a trusted IP network location using the following example policy:

Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Conditional Access Administrator](../role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#conditional-access-administrator).
1. Browse to **Protection** > **Conditional Access** > **Policies**.
1. Select **New policy**.
1. Give your policy a name. We recommend that organizations create a meaningful standard for the names of their policies.
1. Under **Assignments**, select **Users or workload identities**.
   1. Under **Include**, select **All users**.
   1. Under **Exclude**, select **Users and groups** and choose your organization's emergency access or break-glass accounts.
1. Under **Target resources** > **User actions**, select **Register or join devices**.
1. Under Network:
   1. Configure **Yes**.
   1. Include **Any network or location**.
   1. Exclude **All trusted networks and locations**.
1. Under **Access controls** > **Block**, then select **Select**.
1. Confirm your settings and set **Enable policy** to **Report-only**.
1. Select **Create** to create to enable your policy.

  Common Conditional Access policy: Require approved client apps or app protection policy
introduction: |
  People regularly use their mobile devices for both personal and work tasks.
  While making sure staff can be productive, organizations also want to prevent
  data loss from applications on devices they may not manage fully.

  With Conditional Access, organizations can restrict access to
  [approved (modern authentication capable) client apps with Intune app protection policies](concept-conditional-access-grant.md#require-app-protection-policy).
  For older client apps that may not support app protection policies,
  administrators can restrict access to
  [approved client apps](concept-conditional-access-grant.md#require-approved-client-app).

  > [!WARNING]
  > App protection policies are supported on iOS and Android where applications
  > meet specific requirements. **App protection policies are supported on
  > Windows in preview for the Microsoft Edge browser only.** Not all
  > applications that are supported as approved applications or support
  > application protection policies. For a list of some common client apps, see
  > [App protection policy requirement](concept-conditional-access-grant.md#require-app-protection-policy).
  > If your application is not listed there, contact the application developer.
  > In order to require approved client apps for iOS and Android devices, these
  > devices must first register in Microsoft Entra ID.

  > [!NOTE]
  > "Require one of the selected controls" under grant controls is like an OR
  > clause. This is used within policy to enable users to utilize apps that
  > support either the **Require app protection policy** or **Require approved
  > client app** grant controls. **Require app protection policy** is enforced
  > when the app supports that grant control.

  For more information about the benefits of using app protection policies, see
  the article
  [App protection policies overview](/mem/intune/apps/app-protection-policy).


  The following policies are put in to
  [Report-only mode](howto-conditional-access-insights-reporting.md) to start so
  administrators can determine the impact they'll have on existing users. When
  administrators are comfortable that the policies apply as they intend, they
  can switch to **On** or stage the deployment by adding specific groups and
  excluding others.

      Require approved client apps or app protection policy with mobile devices.
    summary: |
      The following steps will help create a Conditional Access policy requiring
      an approved client app **or** an app protection policy when using an
      iOS/iPadOS or Android device. This policy will also prevent the use of
      Exchange ActiveSync clients using basic authentication on mobile devices.
      This policy works in tandem with an
      [app protection policy created in Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/apps/app-protection-policies).

      Organizations can choose to deploy this policy using the steps outlined
      below or using the
      [Conditional Access templates](concept-conditional-access-policy-common.md#conditional-access-templates).
    steps:
      - |
        Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Conditional Access Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#conditional-access-administrator).
      - |
        Browse to **Protection** > **Conditional Access**.
      - |
        Select **Create new policy**.
      - |
        Give your policy a name. We recommend that organizations create a meaningful standard for the names of their policies.
      - |
        Under **Assignments**, select **Users or workload identities**.
          1. Under **Include**, select **All users**.
          2. Under **Exclude**, select **Users and groups** and exclude at least one account to prevent yourself from being locked out. If you don't exclude any accounts, you can't create the policy.
        
      - |
        Under **Target resources** > **Cloud apps** > **Include**, select **All cloud apps**.
      - |
        Under **Conditions** > **Device platforms**, set **Configure** to **Yes**.
          1. Under **Include**, **Select device platforms**.
          2. Choose **Android** and **iOS**.
          3. Select **Done**.

      - |
        Under **Access controls** > **Grant**, select **Grant access**.
          1. Select **Require approved client app** and **Require app protection policy**
          2. **For multiple controls** select **Require one of the selected controls**
        
      - |
        Confirm your settings and set **Enable policy** to **Report-only**.
      - |
        Select **Create** to create to enable your policy.

        After administrators confirm the settings using [report-only mode](howto-conditional-access-insights-reporting.md), they can move the **Enable policy** toggle from **Report-only** to **On**.

        > [!TIP]
        > Organizations should also deploy a policy that
        > [blocks access from unsupported or unknown device platforms](howto-policy-unknown-unsupported-device.md)
        > along with this policy.

      Block Exchange ActiveSync on all devices
    summary: |
      This policy will block all Exchange ActiveSync clients using basic
      authentication from connecting to Exchange Online.
    steps: 
      - |
        Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Conditional Access Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#conditional-access-administrator).
      - |  
        Browse to **Protection** > **Conditional Access**.
      - |  
        Select **Create new policy**.
      - |  
        Give your policy a name. We recommend that organizations create a meaningful standard for the names of their policies.
      - |  
        Under **Assignments**, select **Users or workload identities**.
          1. Under **Include**, select **All users**.
          2. Under **Exclude**, select **Users and groups** and exclude at least one account to prevent yourself from being locked out. If you don't exclude any accounts, you can't create the policy.
          3. Select **Done**.

      - |  
        Under **Target resources** > **Cloud apps** > **Include**, select **Select apps**.
          1. Select **Office 365 Exchange Online**.
          2. Select **Select**.

      - |  
        Under **Conditions** > **Client apps**, set **Configure** to **Yes**.
          1. Uncheck all options except **Exchange ActiveSync clients**.
          2. Select **Done**.

      - |  
        Under **Access controls** > **Grant**, select **Grant access**.
          1. Select **Require app protection policy**

        Confirm your settings and set **Enable policy** to **Report-only**.
      - |  
        Select **Create** to create to enable your policy.

        After administrators confirm the settings using [report-only mode](howto-conditional-access-insights-reporting.md), they can move the **Enable policy** toggle from **Report-only** to **On**.

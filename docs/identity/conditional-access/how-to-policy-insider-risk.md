# Common Conditional Access policy: Block access for users with insider risk

Most users have a normal behavior that can be tracked, when they fall outside of this norm it could be risky to allow them to just sign in. You might want to block that user or ask them to review a specific [terms of use policy](terms-of-use.md). Microsoft Purview can provide an [insider risk signal](concept-conditional-access-conditions.md#insider-risk) to Conditional Access to refine access control decisions. Insider risk management is part of [Microsoft Purview](/purview/insider-risk-management-adaptive-protection). You must enable it before you can use the signal in Conditional Access.

## Block access with Conditional Access policy

> [!TIP]
> Configure [adaptive protection](/purview/insider-risk-management-adaptive-protection) before you create the following policy.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Conditional Access Administrator](../role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#conditional-access-administrator).
1. Browse to **Protection** > **Conditional Access** > **Policies**.
1. Select **New policy**.
1. Give your policy a name. We recommend that organizations create a meaningful standard for the names of their policies.
1. Under **Assignments**, select **Users or workload identities**.
   1. Under **Include**, select **All users**.
   1. Under **Exclude**:
      1. Select **Users and groups** and choose your organization's emergency access or break-glass accounts. 
      1. Select **Guest or external users** and choose the following:
         1. **B2B direct connect users**.
         1. **Service provider users**.
         1. **Other external users**.
1. Under **Target resources** > **Cloud apps** > **Include**, select **All cloud apps**.
1. Under **Conditions** > **Insider risk**, set **Configure** to **Yes**. 
   1. Under **Select the risk levels that must be assigned to enforce the policy**. 
      1. Select **Elevated**.
      1. Select **Done**.
1. Under **Access controls** > **Grant**, select **Block access**, then select **Select**.
1. Confirm your settings and set **Enable policy** to **Report-only**.
1. Select **Create** to create to enable your policy.

After administrators confirm the settings using [report-only mode](howto-conditional-access-insights-reporting.md), they can move the **Enable policy** toggle from **Report-only** to **On**.

Some administrators might create other Conditional Access policies that use other access controls, like terms of use on lower levels of insider risk.

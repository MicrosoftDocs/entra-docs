# Conditional Access optimization agent phased rollout (preview)

The Conditional Access optimization agent for Microsoft Entra includes a preview phased rollout capability that helps organizations deploy new Conditional Access policies safely and efficiently. This Microsoft Security Copilot feature in Microsoft Entra enables administrators to introduce policies gradually, monitor their impact, and minimize disruptions. There are several benefits to this phased rollout capability:

- **User impact mitigation**: Gradual deployment minimizes the chance of widespread disruption to end users.
- **Operational efficiency**: Reduces the need for manual analysis and planning, saving weeks of effort.
- **Customization**: Administrators retain full control over group selection and rollout pacing.
- **Transparency**: The agent provides clear reasoning for group assignments and rollout decisions.

This article explains how the phased rollout process works, outlines prerequisites, and describes the built-in safeguards that help ensure a smooth deployment.

## Prerequisites

- You must have at least the [Microsoft Entra ID P1](overview.md#license-requirements) license.
- You must have available [security compute units (SCU)](/copilot/security/manage-usage).
- [Global Reader](../../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#global-reader) and [Security Reader](../../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#security-reader) roles can view the agent and any suggestions, but can't take any actions.
- [Global Administrator](../../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#global-administrator), [Security Administrator](../../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#security-administrator), and [Conditional Access Administrator](../../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#conditional-access-administrator) roles can view the agent and take action on the suggestions.

## How it works

When the Conditional Access optimization agent creates a new policy in report-only mode, it can suggest turning on the policy with a phased rollout. The agent analyzes sign-in data and existing policies to define a phased rollout plan. There are three main steps in the phased rollout process.

### Agent creates a report-only policy with a phased rollout

The agent creates a report-only policy and builds a separate phased rollout plan. The rollout plans include five phases, starting with small, low-risk groups and progressing to larger, high-risk groups.

### Administrator reviews and accepts the rollout plan

Administrators review the details of the plan and can accept it or modify the group assignments or the time between phases.

To adjust the groups included in a phase:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Security Administrator](../role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#security-administrator).

1. Browse to **Conditional Access Optimization Agent** and select the **Review suggestions** button for a policy suggestion that includes a phased rollout.

1. From the policy details page, select **Review phases**.

1. Select the pencil icon to edit the groups included in the phase.

1. Edit the groups by either adding or removing them from the phase. Select the **Select** button to save the changes.

1. Select **Apply suggestion** to save the changes to the groups and accept the rollout plan.

To adjust the time between phases:

1. From the Conditional Access Optimization Agent page, select the **Settings** tab. 
1. Adjust the days between phases in the **Phased rollout** section.
1. Select the **Save** button to apply the changes.

For more information, review the [Phased rollout settings](agent-optimization.md#phased-rollout-preview).

### Agent executes the approved rollout plan

The agent automatically executes the plan by creating a new, enabled policy that applies to all groups in the first phase. The original report-only policy remains intact so you can continue to collect data on the policy.

The agent deploys the policy to the groups in the next phases based on the defined schedule. You can continue to monitor between each phase of the rollout to ensure the policy does what's expected. While the policy is being rolled out, the policy remains in report-only mode for the remaining phases.

After every phase is complete, the agent will recommend deleting the report-only policy the next time it runs, so you can maintain a clean policy list.

## Built-in safeguards

Once the phased rollout begins, you can't update the policy's grant controls. If changes are made to the grant controls, the phased rollout is canceled. If more than 10% of sign-ins are blocked by the new policy during any phase, the rollout is immediately paused. The administrator is notified so the details can be reviewed and potentially modified.

## Frequently asked questions

### How does the phased rollout capability work?

After selecting the groups that each phase will apply to, the agent creates a duplicate Conditional Access policy that only includes the group of the first phase. The original Conditional Access policy persists in report-only mode and targets all users, so you can continue to collect data. When the deployment advances to the next phase, the batch of groups is added to the enabled Conditional Access policy. The agent monitors how each stage affects the sign-ins associated with this policy. If the success rate drops below 90%, the phased rollout stops and the enabled policy is placed back into report-only mode. You can then review the logs to determine why sign-ins were failing before attempting the phased rollout again.

### Do I have to turn on phased rollout?

The phased rollout capability is turned on by default. To turn it off, go to the **Settings** tab on the Conditional Access Optimization Agent page. Under **Phased rollout**, switch the toggle to **Off**.

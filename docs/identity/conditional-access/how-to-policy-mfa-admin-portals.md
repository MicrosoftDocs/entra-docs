# Common Conditional Access policy: Require multifactor authentication for admins accessing Microsoft admin portals

Microsoft recommends securing access to any Microsoft admin portals like Microsoft Entra, Microsoft 365, Exchange, and Azure. Using the [Microsoft Admin Portals](concept-conditional-access-cloud-apps.md#microsoft-admin-portals) app organizations can control interactive access to Microsoft admin portals.

Microsoft recommends you require enable this policy for the following roles at a minimum, based on [identity score recommendations](~/identity/monitoring-health/concept-identity-secure-score.md):

[!INCLUDE [conditional-access-admin-roles](../../includes/conditional-access-admin-roles.md)]

## User exclusions
[!INCLUDE [active-directory-policy-exclusions](~/includes/entra-policy-exclude-user.md)]

[!INCLUDE [active-directory-policy-deploy-template](~/includes/entra-policy-deploy-template.md)]

## Create a Conditional Access policy

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Conditional Access Administrator](../role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#conditional-access-administrator).
1. Browse to **Protection** > **Conditional Access** > **Policies**.
1. Select **New policy**.
1. Give your policy a name. We recommend that organizations create a meaningful standard for the names of their policies.
1. Under **Assignments**, select **Users or workload identities**.
   1. Under **Include**, select **Directory roles** and choose at least the previously listed roles.
   
      > [!WARNING]
      > Conditional Access policies support built-in roles. Conditional Access policies are not enforced for other role types including [administrative unit-scoped](~/identity/role-based-access-control/admin-units-assign-roles.md) or [custom roles](~/identity/role-based-access-control/custom-create.yml).

   1. Under **Exclude**, select **Users and groups** and choose your organization's emergency access or break-glass accounts.
1. Under **Target resources** > **Cloud apps** > **Include**, **Select apps**, select **Microsoft Admin Portals**.
1. Under **Access controls** > **Grant**, select **Grant access**, **Require authentication strength**, select **Multifactor authentication**, then select **Select**.
1. Confirm your settings and set **Enable policy** to **Report-only**.
1. Select **Create** to create to enable your policy.

After administrators confirm the settings using [report-only mode](howto-conditional-access-insights-reporting.md), they can move the **Enable policy** toggle from **Report-only** to **On**.

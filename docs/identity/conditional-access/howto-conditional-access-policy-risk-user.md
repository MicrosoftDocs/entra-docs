# Common Conditional Access policy: User risk-based password change

Microsoft works with researchers, law enforcement, various security teams at Microsoft, and other trusted sources to find leaked username and password pairs. Organizations with Microsoft Entra ID P2 licenses can create Conditional Access policies incorporating [Microsoft Entra ID Protection user risk detections](~/id-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks.md). 

## User exclusions
[!INCLUDE [active-directory-policy-exclusions](~/includes/entra-policy-exclude-user.md)]

[!INCLUDE [active-directory-policy-deploy-template](~/includes/entra-policy-deploy-template.md)]

## Enable with Conditional Access policy

[!INCLUDE [conditional-access-policy-user-risk](../../includes/conditional-access-policy-user-risk.md)]

# Configure Qminder for Single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID

In this article,  you learn how to integrate Qminder with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Qminder with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Qminder.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Qminder with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites
The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

[!INCLUDE [common-prerequisites.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/common-prerequisites.md)]
* Qminder single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Qminder supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.

## Add Qminder from the gallery

To configure the integration of Qminder into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Qminder from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Qminder** in the search box.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Qminder

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Qminder using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Qminder.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Qminder, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-microsoft-entra-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Qminder SSO](#configure-qminder-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Qminder test user](#create-qminder-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Qminder that's linked to the Microsoft Entra ID representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO in the Microsoft Entra admin center.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **Qminder** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, the application is preconfigured and the necessary URLs are already prepopulated with Microsoft Entra. The user needs to save the configuration by selecting the **Save** button.

1. Perform the following step, if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    In the **Sign on URL** text box, type the URL:
    `https://dashboard.qminder.com/login/`

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, select copy button to copy **App Federation Metadata Url** and save it on your computer.

## Configure Qminder SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Qminder** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [Qminder support team](mailto:support@qminder.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Qminder test user

In this section, you create a user called B.Simon in Qminder. Work withÂ [Qminder support team](mailto:support@qminder.com) to add the users in the Qminder platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.
 
#### SP initiated:
 
* Select **Test this application** in Microsoft Entra admin center. this option redirects to Qminder Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  
 
* Go to Qminder Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.
 
#### IDP initiated:
 
* Select **Test this application** in Microsoft Entra admin center and you should be automatically signed in to the Qminder for which you set up the SSO.
 
You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the Qminder tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign-on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Qminder for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

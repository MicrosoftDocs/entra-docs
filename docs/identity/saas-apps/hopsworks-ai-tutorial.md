# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) integration with Hopsworks.ai

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Hopsworks.ai with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Hopsworks.ai with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Hopsworks.ai.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Hopsworks.ai with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Hopsworks.ai single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Hopsworks.ai supports **SP** initiated SSO.
* Hopsworks.ai supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Add Hopsworks.ai from the gallery

To configure the integration of Hopsworks.ai into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Hopsworks.ai from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Hopsworks.ai** in the search box.
1. Select **Hopsworks.ai** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Hopsworks.ai

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Hopsworks.ai using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Hopsworks.ai.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Hopsworks.ai, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Hopsworks.ai SSO](#configure-hopsworksai-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Hopsworks.ai test user](#create-hopsworksai-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Hopsworks.ai that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Hopsworks.ai SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Hopsworks.ai** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [Hopsworks.ai support team](mailto:support@logicalclocks.com).They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Hopsworks.ai test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in Hopsworks.ai. Hopsworks.ai supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Hopsworks.ai, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Hopsworks.ai Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Hopsworks.ai Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Hopsworks.ai tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Hopsworks.ai Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure Hopsworks.ai you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

## Configure Culture Shift SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Culture Shift** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [Culture Shift support team](mailto:tickets@culture-shift.co.uk). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Culture Shift test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Culture Shift. Work with [Culture Shift support team](mailto:tickets@culture-shift.co.uk) to add the users in the Culture Shift platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to Culture Shift Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Culture Shift Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the Culture Shift tile in the My Apps, this option redirects to Culture Shift Sign-on URL. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **EasySSO for Jira** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<server-base-url>/plugins/servlet/easysso/saml`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<server-base-url>/plugins/servlet/easysso/saml`

1. Select **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<server-base-url>/login.jsp`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values aren't real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Sign-on URL. Contact [EasySSO support team](mailto:support@techtime.co.nz) to get these values if in doubt. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section.

1. EasySSO for Jira application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![image](common/default-attributes.png)

1. In addition to above, EasySSO for Jira application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.
	
	| Name | Source Attribute|
	| ---------------| --------- |
	| urn:oid:0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.1 | user.userprincipalname |
	| urn:oid:0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.3 | user.mail |
	| urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113730.3.1.241 | user.displayname |
	| urn:oid:2.5.4.4 | user.surname |
	| urn:oid:2.5.4.42 | user.givenname |
    
	In case your Microsoft Entra users have **sAMAccountName** configured you would have to map **urn:oid:0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.1** onto **sAMAccountName** attribute.
    
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, In the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, select **Download** links for **Certificate (Base64)** or **Federation Metadata XML** options and save either or all to your computer. You need it later to configure Jira EasySSO.

	![The Certificate download link](media/easysso-for-jira-tutorial/azure-ad-SAML-certificate.png)
	
	If you plan to perform EasySSO for Jira configuration manually with certificate, you also need to copy **Login URL** and **Microsoft Entra Identifier** from the section below and save those on your computer.

    ![Metadata URL](media/easysso-for-jira-tutorial/jira-admin-4.png)

5. Now, locate **Certificate (Base64)** or **Metadata File** you have saved in the earlier steps of **Microsoft Entra SSO** configuration. You have following options on how to proceed:

    a. Use the App Federation **Metadata File** you downloaded to local file on your computer. Select **Upload** radio button and follow the upload file dialog specific to your operating system.

    **OR**

    b. Open the App Federation **Metadata File** to see the content (in any plain text editor) of the file and copy it into the clipboard. Select **Input** option and paste clipboard content into the text field.

     **OR**

    c. Fully manual configuration. Open the App Federation **Certificate (Base64)** to see the content (in any plain text editor) of the file and copy it into the clipboard. Paste it into **IdP Token Signing Certificates** text field. Then navigate to **General** tab and fill **POST Binding URL** and **Entity ID** fields with respective values for **Login URL** and **Microsoft Entra Identifier** you saved previously.
 
6. Select **Save** button on the bottom of the page. You see the content of the Metadata or Certificate files is parsed into the configuration fields. EasySSO for Jira configuration is complete.

7. For the best testing experience, navigate to **Look & Feel** tab and check the **SAML Login Button** option on. This will enable separate button on the Jira login screen specifically to test your Microsoft Entra SAML integration end to end. You can leave this button on and configure its placement, colour and translation for production mode, too.

    > Should you have any issues, please contact [EasySSO support team](mailto:support@techtime.co.nz).

### Create EasySSO for Jira test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in Jira. EasySSO for Jira supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is **disabled** by default. To enable user provisioning, you have to explicitly check **Create user on successful login** option on in the General section of EasySSO plugin configuration. If a user doesn't already exist in Jira, a new one is created after authentication.

However, if you don't wish to enable automatic user provisioning on the user first login, users must exist in backend User Directories the Jira instance make use of, such as LDAP or Atlassian Crowd.

## Test SSO 

### IdP-initiated workflow

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the EasySSO for Jira for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the EasySSO for Jira tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the EasySSO for Jira for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

### SP-initiated workflow

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration using Jira **SAML Login** button.

![User SAML login](media/easysso-for-jira-tutorial/jira-admin-7.png)

This scenario presumes you have enabled **SAML Login Button** in **Look & Feel** tab in your Jira EasySSO configuration page (see above). Open your Jira login URL in browser incognito mode to avoid any interference with your existing sessions. Select **SAML Login** button and you get redirected to Microsoft Entra user authentication flow. Once successfully completed you be redirected back to your Jira instance as authenticated user via SAML.

There's a possibility you may encounter the following screen after getting redirected back from Microsoft Entra ID.

![EasySSO failure screen](media/easysso-for-jira-tutorial/jira-admin-8.png)

In this case you have to follow the [instructions on this page](https://techtime.co.nz/display/TECHTIME/EasySSO+How+to+get+the+logs#EasySSOHowtogetthelogs-RETRIEVINGTHELOGS) to get access to **atlassian-jira.log** file. Details of the error is available by the reference ID found on EasySSO error page.

Should you have any issues digesting the log messages, please contact [EasySSO support team](mailto:support@techtime.co.nz).

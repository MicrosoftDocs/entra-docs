* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Showpad with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites
The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

[!INCLUDE [common-prerequisites.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/common-prerequisites.md)]
* Showpad single sign-on enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

* Showpad supports **SP** initiated SSO.
* Showpad supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Add Showpad from the gallery

To configure the integration of Showpad into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Showpad from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Showpad** in the search box.

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Showpad SSO](#configure-showpad-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in Showpad. Showpad supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Showpad, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to Showpad Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Showpad Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the Showpad tile in the My Apps, this option redirects to Showpad Sign-on URL. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

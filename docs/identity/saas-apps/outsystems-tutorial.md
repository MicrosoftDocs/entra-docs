## Add OutSystems Microsoft Entra ID from the gallery

To configure the integration of OutSystems Microsoft Entra ID into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add OutSystems Microsoft Entra ID from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **OutSystems Microsoft Entra ID** in the search box.
1. Select **OutSystems Microsoft Entra ID** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for OutSystems Microsoft Entra ID

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with OutSystems Microsoft Entra ID using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in OutSystems Microsoft Entra ID.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with OutSystems Microsoft Entra ID, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure OutSystems Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-outsystems-azure-ad-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create OutSystems Microsoft Entra test user](#create-outsystems-azure-ad-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in OutSystems Microsoft Entra ID that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure OutSystems Microsoft Entra SSO

To configure single sign-on on OutSystems side, you need to download the [IdP forge](https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component-overview/599/idp) component, configure it as mentioned in the [instructions](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/Development_FAQs/How_to_configure_OutSystems_to_use_identity_providers_using_SAML#Configure_your_application_to_use_IdP_connector). After installing the component and do the necessary code changes, configure Microsoft Entra ID by downloading Federation Metadata XML from Azure portal and upload on OutSystems IdP component, according to the following [instructions](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/Development_FAQs/How_to_configure_OutSystems_to_use_identity_providers_using_SAML#Azure_AD_.2F_ADFS).

<a name='create-outsystems-azure-ad-test-user'></a>

### Create OutSystems Microsoft Entra test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in OutSystems. OutSystems supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in OutSystems, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to OutSystems Microsoft Entra ID Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to OutSystems Microsoft Entra Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the OutSystems Microsoft Entra ID for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the OutSystems Microsoft Entra ID tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the OutSystems Microsoft Entra ID for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure OutSystems Microsoft Entra ID you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

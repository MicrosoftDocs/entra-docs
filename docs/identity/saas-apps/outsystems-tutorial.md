## Configure OutSystems Microsoft Entra SSO

To configure single sign-on on OutSystems side, you need to download the [IdP forge](https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component-overview/599/idp) component, configure it as mentioned in the [instructions](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/Development_FAQs/How_to_configure_OutSystems_to_use_identity_providers_using_SAML#Configure_your_application_to_use_IdP_connector). After installing the component and do the necessary code changes, configure Microsoft Entra ID by downloading Federation Metadata XML from Azure portal and upload on OutSystems IdP component, according to the following [instructions](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/Development_FAQs/How_to_configure_OutSystems_to_use_identity_providers_using_SAML#Azure_AD_.2F_ADFS).

### Create OutSystems Microsoft Entra test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in OutSystems. OutSystems supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in OutSystems, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to OutSystems Microsoft Entra ID Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to OutSystems Microsoft Entra Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the OutSystems Microsoft Entra ID for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the OutSystems Microsoft Entra ID tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the OutSystems Microsoft Entra ID for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

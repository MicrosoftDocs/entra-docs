They configure this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Mind Tools Toolkit test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in Mind Tools Toolkit. Mind Tools Toolkit supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Mind Tools Toolkit, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to Mind Tools Toolkit Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Mind Tools Toolkit Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the Mind Tools Toolkit tile in the My Apps, this option redirects to Mind Tools Toolkit Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

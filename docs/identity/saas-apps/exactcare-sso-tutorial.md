## Configure ExactCare SSO

To configure single sign-on on **ExactCare SSO** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [ExactCare SSO support team](mailto:help@exactcarepharmacy.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create ExactCare SSO test user

In this section, you create a user called B.Simon in ExactCare SSO. Work withÂ [ExactCare SSO support team](mailto:help@exactcarepharmacy.com) to add the users in the ExactCare SSO platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you select the ExactCare SSO tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the ExactCare SSO for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

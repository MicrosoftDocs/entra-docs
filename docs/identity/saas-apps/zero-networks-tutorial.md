# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with Zero Networks

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Zero Networks with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Zero Networks with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Zero Networks.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Zero Networks with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Zero Networks single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure Microsoft Entra SSO for the Zero Networks Admin Portal and Access Portal.

* Zero Networks supports **SP** initiated SSO.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add Zero Networks from the gallery

To configure the integration of Zero Networks into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Zero Networks from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Zero Networks** in the search box.
1. Select **Zero Networks** from results panel and select **Create** to add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with Small Improvements

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Small Improvements with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Small Improvements with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Small Improvements.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Small Improvements with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Small Improvements single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* Small Improvements supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Add Small Improvements from the gallery

To configure the integration of Small Improvements into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Small Improvements from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Small Improvements** in the search box.
1. Select **Small Improvements** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

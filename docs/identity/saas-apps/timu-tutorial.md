# Configure TIMU for Single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID

In this article,  you learn how to integrate TIMU with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate TIMU with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to TIMU.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to TIMU with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites
The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

[!INCLUDE [common-prerequisites.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/common-prerequisites.md)]
* TIMU single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* TIMU supports **SP** initiated SSO

* TIMU supports **Just In Time** user provisioning

## Adding TIMU from the gallery

To configure the integration of TIMU into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add TIMU from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **TIMU** in the search box.
1. Select **TIMU** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for TIMU

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with TIMU, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure TIMU SSO](#configure-timu-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create TIMU test user](#create-timu-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in TIMU that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure TIMU SSO

To configure single sign-on on **TIMU** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [TIMU support team](mailto:support@timu.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create TIMU test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in TIMU. TIMU supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in TIMU, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to TIMU Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to TIMU Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft Access Panel. When you select the TIMU tile in the Access Panel, this option redirects to TIMU Sign-on URL. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

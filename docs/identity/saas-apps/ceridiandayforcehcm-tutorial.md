# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra integration with Ceridian Dayforce HCM

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Ceridian Dayforce HCM with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Ceridian Dayforce HCM with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Ceridian Dayforce HCM.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Ceridian Dayforce HCM with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Ceridian Dayforce HCM single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* Ceridian Dayforce HCM supports **SP** initiated SSO

## Add Ceridian Dayforce HCM from the gallery

To configure the integration of Ceridian Dayforce HCM into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Ceridian Dayforce HCM from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Ceridian Dayforce HCM SSO](#configure-ceridian-dayforce-hcm-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Ceridian Dayforce HCM test user](#create-ceridian-dayforce-hcm-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Ceridian Dayforce HCM that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Ceridian Dayforce HCM SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Ceridian Dayforce HCM** side, you need to send the downloaded **Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [Ceridian Dayforce HCM support team](https://www.dayforce.com/resources/help-center). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Ceridian Dayforce HCM test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Ceridian Dayforce HCM. Work with [Ceridian Dayforce HCM support team](https://www.dayforce.com/resources/help-center) to add the users in the Ceridian Dayforce HCM platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

### Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Ceridian Dayforce HCM Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Ceridian Dayforce HCM Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Ceridian Dayforce HCM tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Ceridian Dayforce HCM Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure Ceridian Dayforce HCM you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

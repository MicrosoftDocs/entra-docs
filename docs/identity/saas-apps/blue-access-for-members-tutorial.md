# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with Blue Access for Members (BAM)

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Blue Access for Members (BAM) with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Blue Access for Members (BAM) with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Blue Access for Members (BAM).
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Blue Access for Members (BAM) with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Blue Access for Members (BAM) single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.
* Along with Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator can also add or manage applications in Microsoft Entra ID.
For more information, see [Azure built-in roles](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md).

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Blue Access for Members (BAM) supports **IDP** initiated SSO.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Blue Access for Members (BAM)

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Blue Access for Members (BAM) SSO](#configure-blue-access-for-members-bam-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Blue Access for Members (BAM) test user](#create-blue-access-for-members-bam-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Blue Access for Members (BAM) that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Blue Access for Members (BAM) test user

In this section, you create a user called B.Simon in Blue Access for Members (BAM). Work withÂ [Blue Access for Members (BAM) support team](https://www.bcbstx.com/contact-us) to add the users in the Blue Access for Members (BAM) platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Blue Access for Members (BAM) for which you set up the SSO.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Blue Access for Members (BAM) tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the Blue Access for Members (BAM) for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

## Next steps

Once you configure Blue Access for Members (BAM) you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâs sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

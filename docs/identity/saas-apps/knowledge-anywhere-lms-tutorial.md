# Tutorial: Integrate Knowledge Anywhere LMS with Microsoft Entra ID

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Knowledge Anywhere LMS with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Knowledge Anywhere LMS with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Knowledge Anywhere LMS.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Knowledge Anywhere LMS with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Knowledge Anywhere LMS single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment. 
* Knowledge Anywhere LMS supports **SP** initiated SSO.
* Knowledge Anywhere LMS supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Add Knowledge Anywhere LMS from the gallery

To configure the integration of Knowledge Anywhere LMS into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Knowledge Anywhere LMS from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Knowledge Anywhere LMS** in the search box.
1. Select **Knowledge Anywhere LMS** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Knowledge Anywhere LMS

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Knowledge Anywhere LMS using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Knowledge Anywhere LMS.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Knowledge Anywhere LMS, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Knowledge Anywhere LMS SSO](#configure-knowledge-anywhere-lms-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Knowledge Anywhere LMS test user](#create-knowledge-anywhere-lms-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Knowledge Anywhere LMS that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Knowledge Anywhere LMS Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Knowledge Anywhere LMS Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Knowledge Anywhere LMS tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Knowledge Anywhere LMS Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure Knowledge Anywhere LMS you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time.

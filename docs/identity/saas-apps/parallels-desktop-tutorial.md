# Microsoft Entra SSO integration with Parallels Desktop

In this article, you'll learn how to integrate Parallels Desktop with Microsoft Entra ID. SSO/SAML authentication for employees to use Parallels Desktop. Enable your employees to sign in and activate Parallels Desktop with a corporate account. When you integrate Parallels Desktop with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Parallels Desktop.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Parallels Desktop with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

You'll configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on for Parallels Desktop in a test environment. Parallels Desktop supports only **SP** initiated single sign-on.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Microsoft Entra ID with Parallels Desktop, you need:

* A Microsoft Entra user account. If you don't already have one, you can [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* One of the following roles: Global Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator, or owner of the service principal.
* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Parallels Desktop single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Add application and assign a test user

Before you begin the process of configuring single sign-on, you need to add the Parallels Desktop application from the Microsoft Entra gallery. You need a test user account to assign to the application and test the single sign-on configuration.

## Configure Parallels Desktop SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Parallels Desktop** side, follow the latest version of Parallels's Azure SSO setup guide on [this page](https://kb.parallels.com/en/129240). If you encounter any difficulties throughout the setup process, contact [Parallels Desktop support team](https://www.parallels.com/support/).

### Create Parallels Desktop test user

Add existing user accounts to the Admin or User groups on the Microsoft Entra ID side, following Parallels's Azure SSO setup guide that can be found on [this page](https://kb.parallels.com/en/129240). When a user account gets deactivated following their departure from the organization, that is immediately reflected in the user count of the Parallels's product license.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Parallels Desktop Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Parallels Desktop Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Parallels Desktop tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Parallels Desktop Sign-on URL. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

[!INCLUDE [common-prerequisites.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/common-prerequisites.md)]
* X-point Cloud single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* X-point Cloud supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Add X-point Cloud from the gallery

To configure the integration of X-point Cloud into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add X-point Cloud from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure X-point Cloud SSO](#configure-x-point-cloud-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create X-point Cloud test user](#create-x-point-cloud-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in X-point Cloud that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.

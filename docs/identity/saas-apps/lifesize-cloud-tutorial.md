# Configure Lifesize Cloud for Single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID

In this article,  you learn how to integrate Lifesize Cloud with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Lifesize Cloud with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Lifesize Cloud.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Lifesize Cloud with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites
The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

[!INCLUDE [common-prerequisites.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/common-prerequisites.md)]
* Lifesize Cloud single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> This integration is also available to use from Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud environment. You can find this application in the Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud Application Gallery and configure it in the same way as you do from public cloud.

## Scenario description

In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* Lifesize Cloud supports **SP** initiated SSO.

* Lifesize Cloud supports **Automated** user provisioning.

## Add Lifesize Cloud from the gallery

To configure the integration of Lifesize Cloud into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Lifesize Cloud from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Lifesize Cloud** in the search box.
1. Select **Lifesize Cloud** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Lifesize Cloud

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Lifesize Cloud using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Lifesize Cloud.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Lifesize Cloud, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Lifesize Cloud SSO](#configure-lifesize-cloud-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Lifesize Cloud test user](#create-lifesize-cloud-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Lifesize Cloud that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Create Lifesize Cloud test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Lifesize Cloud. Lifesize cloud does support automatic user provisioning. After successful authentication at Microsoft Entra ID, the user is automatically provisioned in the application.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to Lifesize Cloud Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Lifesize Cloud Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the Lifesize Cloud tile in the My Apps, this option redirects to Lifesize Cloud Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

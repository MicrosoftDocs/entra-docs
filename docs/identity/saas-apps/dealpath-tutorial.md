# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with Dealpath

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Dealpath with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Dealpath with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Dealpath.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Dealpath with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Dealpath single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* Dealpath supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Add Dealpath from the gallery

To configure the integration of Dealpath into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Dealpath from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Dealpath** in the search box.
1. Select **Dealpath** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Dealpath

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Dealpath using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Dealpath.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Dealpath, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Dealpath SSO](#configure-dealpath-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Dealpath test user](#create-dealpath-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Dealpath that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Dealpath Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Dealpath Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Dealpath tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Dealpath Sign-on URL. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

## Next steps

Once you configure Dealpath you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra integration with Zscaler Internet Access Administrator

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Zscaler Internet Access Administrator with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Zscaler Internet Access Administrator with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

- Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Zscaler Internet Access Administrator.
- Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Zscaler Internet Access Administrator with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
- Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

- A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
- Zscaler Internet Access Administrator single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> This integration is also available to use from Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud environment. You can find this application in the Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud Application Gallery and configure it in the same way as you do from public cloud.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

- Zscaler Internet Access Administrator supports **IDP** initiated SSO.

## Add Zscaler Internet Access Administrator from the gallery

To configure the integration of Zscaler Internet Access Administrator into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Zscaler Internet Access Administrator from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Zscaler Internet Access Administrator** in the search box.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

- Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Zscaler Internet Access Administrator for which you set up the SSO

- You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Zscaler Internet Access Administrator tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the Zscaler Internet Access Administrator for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Go to TeamzSkill Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the TeamzSkill for which you set up the SSO 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the TeamzSkill tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the TeamzSkill for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

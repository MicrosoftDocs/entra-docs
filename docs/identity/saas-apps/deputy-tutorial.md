# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra integration with Deputy

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Deputy with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Deputy with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Deputy.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Deputy with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Deputy single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Deputy supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.
* Deputy supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Add Deputy from the gallery

To configure the integration of Deputy into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Deputy from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Deputy** in the search box.
1. Select **Deputy** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Deputy

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Deputy using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Deputy.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Deputy, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Deputy SSO](#configure-deputy-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Deputy test user](#create-deputy-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Deputy that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<your-subdomain>.<region>.deputy.com`

	>[!NOTE]
    > Deputy region suffix is optional, or it should use one of these: 
    > au | na | eu |as |la |af |an |ent-au |ent-na |ent-eu |ent-as | ent-la | ent-af | ent-an

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Sign-on URL. Contact [Deputy Client support team](https://www.deputy.com/call-centers-customer-support-scheduling-software) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section.

1. Deputy application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![image](common/default-attributes.png)

1. In addition to above, Deputy application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response, which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.
	
	| Name |  Source Attribute|
	| -------------- | --------- |
	| First name | user.givenname|
	| Last name | user.surname |

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to TeamzSkill Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to TeamzSkill Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the TeamzSkill for which you set up the SSO 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the TeamzSkill tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the TeamzSkill for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).


## Next steps

Once you configure Deputy you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Freshworks SSO](#configure-freshworks-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Freshworks test user](#create-freshworks-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Freshworks that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Create Freshworks test user

In this section, you create a user called B.Simon in Freshworks. Work with [Freshworks Client support team](mailto:support@freshworks.com) to add the users in the Freshworks platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on. 

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to Freshworks Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Freshworks Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Freshworks for which you set up the SSO 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the Freshworks tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Freshworks for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

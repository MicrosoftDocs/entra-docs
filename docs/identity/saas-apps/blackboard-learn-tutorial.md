### Create Blackboard Learn test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in Blackboard Learn. Blackboard Learn supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to Blackboard Learn Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Blackboard Learn Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the Blackboard Learn tile in the My Apps, this option redirects to Blackboard Learn Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

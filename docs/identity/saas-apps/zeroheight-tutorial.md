# Configure zeroheight for Single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID

In this article,  you learn how to integrate zeroheight with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate zeroheight with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to zeroheight.

[!INCLUDE [common-prerequisites.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/common-prerequisites.md)]
* zeroheight single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* zeroheight supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Add zeroheight from the gallery

To configure the integration of zeroheight into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add zeroheight from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **zeroheight** in the search box.

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure zeroheight SSO](#configure-zeroheight-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create zeroheight test user](#create-zeroheight-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in zeroheight that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **zeroheight** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** text box, type a value using the following pattern:
    `zeroheight:<CUSTOM_ID>`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://zeroheight.com/sso/acs/<CUSTOM_ID>`

    c. In the **Sign on URL** text box, type the URL:
    `https://zeroheight.com/sso`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values aren't real. Update these values with the actual Identifier and Reply URL. These values are generated for you in your account. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section.

1. The zeroheight application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format and requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. Find the following section with the default attributes.

1. zeroheight doesn't use any of the default attributes. Instead, add the following attributes to be passed back in SAML response. These attributes should also be pre-populated but you can review them as per your requirements.
	
	| Name |  Source Attribute|
	| ---------- | --------- |
	| email | user.mail |
	| FirstName | user.givenname |

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, In the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, select copy button to copy **App Federation Metadata Url** and save it on your computer.

## Configure zeroheight SSO

To configure single sign-on on **zeroheight** side, you need to paste the **App Federation Metadata Url** into your browser and download the XML file. Then you need to extract the Identity Provider Single Sign-On URL and X.509 Certificate from it. Ask your IT team if you're unsure.

### Create zeroheight test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in zeroheight. Work with [zeroheight support team](mailto:support@zeroheight.com) to add the users in the zeroheight platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to zeroheight Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to zeroheight Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the zeroheight tile in the My Apps, this option redirects to zeroheight Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Configure ShipHazmat SSO

To configure single sign-on on **ShipHazmat** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [ShipHazmat support team](mailto:support@bureaudg.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create ShipHazmat test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in ShipHazmat. ShipHazmat supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in ShipHazmat, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the ShipHazmat for which you set up the SSO.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the ShipHazmat tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the ShipHazmat for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with Balsamiq Wireframes

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Balsamiq Wireframes with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Balsamiq Wireframes with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Balsamiq Wireframes.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Balsamiq Wireframes with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Balsamiq Wireframes single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is only available for users on the 200-projects Space plan.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Balsamiq Wireframes supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.
* Balsamiq Wireframes supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Add Balsamiq Wireframes from the gallery

To configure the integration of Balsamiq Wireframes into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Balsamiq Wireframes from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Balsamiq Wireframes** in the search box.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Balsamiq Wireframes

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Balsamiq Wireframes using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Balsamiq Wireframes.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Balsamiq Wireframes, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Balsamiq Wireframes SSO](#configure-balsamiq-wireframes-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Balsamiq Wireframes test user](#create-balsamiq-wireframes-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Balsamiq Wireframes that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **Balsamiq Wireframes** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

	![Screenshot shows list of attributes.](common/default-attributes.png)

1. In addition to above, Balsamiq Wireframes application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.
	
	| Name | Source Attribute|
	| ----------| --------- |
	| Email | user.mail |
    | firstName | user.givenname |
    | lastName | user.surname |

### Create Balsamiq Wireframes test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in Balsamiq Wireframes. Balsamiq Wireframes supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Balsamiq Wireframes, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Balsamiq Wireframes Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Balsamiq Wireframes Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Balsamiq Wireframes for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the Balsamiq Wireframes tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Balsamiq Wireframes for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

## Next steps

Once you configure Balsamiq Wireframes you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with Percolate

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Percolate with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Percolate with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Percolate.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Percolate with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To configure Microsoft Entra integration with Percolate, you need to have:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a Microsoft Entra environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* A Percolate subscription that has single sign-on enabled.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you'll configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* Percolate supports SP-initiated and IdP-initiated SSO.

## Add Percolate from the gallery

To configure the integration of Percolate into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Percolate from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Percolate** in the search box.
1. Select **Percolate** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Percolate

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Percolate using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Percolate.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Percolate, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Percolate SSO](#configure-percolate-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Percolate test user](#create-percolate-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Percolate that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

4. In the **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog box, you don't need to take any action to configure the application in IdP-initiated mode. The app is already integrated with Azure.

5. If you want to configure the application in SP-initiated mode, select **Set additional URLs** and, in the **Sign on URL** box, enter **https://percolate.com/app/login**.

6. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, select the **Copy** icon to copy the **App Federation Metadata Url**. Save this URL.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Percolate Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Percolate Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Percolate for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the Percolate tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Percolate for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

## Next steps

Once you configure Percolate you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

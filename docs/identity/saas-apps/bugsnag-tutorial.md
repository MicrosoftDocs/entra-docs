### Create Bugsnag test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in Bugsnag. Bugsnag supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Bugsnag, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to Bugsnag Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Bugsnag Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Bugsnag for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the Bugsnag tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign-on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Bugsnag for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

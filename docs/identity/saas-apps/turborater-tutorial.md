# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra integration with TurboRater

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate TurboRater with Microsoft Entra ID.

Integrating TurboRater with Microsoft Entra ID provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to TurboRater.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed in to TurboRater (single sign-on) with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location: the Azure portal.

For details about software as a service (SaaS) app integration with Microsoft Entra ID, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID?](~/identity/enterprise-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To configure Microsoft Entra integration with TurboRater, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.
* A TurboRater subscription with single sign-on enabled.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

TurboRater supports IDP-initiated single sign-on (SSO).

## Add TurboRater from the Azure Marketplace

To configure the integration of TurboRater into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add TurboRater from the Azure Marketplace to your list of managed SaaS apps:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **TurboRater** in the search box.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with TurboRater based on a test user named  **B Simon**. For single sign-on to work, you must establish a link between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in TurboRater.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with TurboRater, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra single sign-on](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** to enable your users to use this feature.
1. **[Configure TurboRater single sign-on](#configure-turborater-single-sign-on)** to configure the single sign-on settings on the application side.
1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B. Simon.
1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** to enable B. Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Create a TurboRater test user](#create-a-turborater-test-user)** so that there's a user named B. Simon in TurboRater who's linked to the Microsoft Entra user named B. Simon.
1. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** to verify whether the configuration works.

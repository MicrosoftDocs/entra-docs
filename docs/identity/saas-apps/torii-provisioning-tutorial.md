# Configure Torii for automatic user provisioning with Microsoft Entra ID

This article describes the steps you need to perform in both Torii and Microsoft Entra ID to configure automatic user provisioning. When configured, Microsoft Entra ID automatically provisions and de-provisions users to [Torii](https://toriihq.com) using the Microsoft Entra provisioning service. For important details on what this service does, how it works, and frequently asked questions, see [Automate user provisioning and deprovisioning to SaaS applications with Microsoft Entra ID](~/identity/app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md). 


## Supported capabilities
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create users in Torii.
> * Remove users in Torii when they don't require access anymore.
> * Keep user attributes synchronized between Microsoft Entra ID and Torii.
> * [Single sign-on](torii-tutorial.md) to Torii (recommended).

## Prerequisites

The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

* [A Microsoft Entra tenant](~/identity-platform/quickstart-create-new-tenant.md) 
* One of the following roles: [Application Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#application-administrator), [Cloud Application Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#cloud-application-administrator), or [Application Owner](/entra/fundamentals/users-default-permissions#owned-enterprise-applications).
* An administrator account with Torii.

## Step 1: Plan your provisioning deployment
1. Learn about [how the provisioning service works](~/identity/app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md).
1. Determine who's in [scope for provisioning](~/identity/app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).
1. Determine what data to [map between Microsoft Entra ID and Torii](~/identity/app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes.md).

## Step 2: Configure Torii to support provisioning with Microsoft Entra ID
1. Log in to [Torii admin console](https://app.toriihq.com).
1. Navigate to [Settings](https://app.toriihq.com/team/settings/apiAccess) page > **Security**, enable the SCIM toggle.

	![Screenshot of SCIM Toggle.](media/torii-provisioning-tutorial/scim-enabled.png)
1. Navigate to the **API Access** tab. From here, you can view and manage the Torii API keys and SCIM.
1. Select **Generate API Key** to generate a new SCIM.

	![Screenshot of Generate API Key.](media/torii-provisioning-tutorial/generate-key.png)
1. Choose type: **SCIM**.
1. Add **Description** and set **Expiration date**. For security purposes, we recommend setting an expiration date when generating a new key.
1. Select **Generate key**.
1. Copy and save the API Key as it won't be available next. This value is entered in the **Secret Token** field in the Provisioning tab of your Torii application.
1. Select **Got it**.

	![Screenshot of Copy API Key.](media/torii-provisioning-tutorial/copy-key.png)
   
1. **Torii Tenant Url:** `https://api.toriihq.com/v1.0/scim/v2` is entered in the **Tenant URL** field in the Provisioning tab of your Torii application.

## Step 3: Add Torii from the Microsoft Entra application gallery

Add Torii from the Microsoft Entra application gallery to start managing provisioning to Torii. If you have previously setup Torii for SSO you can use the same application. However it's recommended that you create a separate app when testing out the integration initially. Learn more about adding an application from the gallery [here](~/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal.md). 

## Step 4: Define who is in scope for provisioning 

[!INCLUDE [create-assign-users-provisioning.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/create-assign-users-provisioning.md)]

## Step 5: Configure automatic user provisioning to Torii 

This section guides you through the steps to configure the Microsoft Entra provisioning service to create, update, and disable users in TestApp based on user and/or group assignments in Microsoft Entra ID.

### To configure automatic user provisioning for Torii in Microsoft Entra ID:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps**

	![Screenshot of Enterprise applications blade.](common/enterprise-applications.png)

1. In the applications list, select **Torii**.

	![Screenshot of the Torii link in the Applications list.](common/all-applications.png)

1. Select the **Provisioning** tab.

	![Screenshot of Provisioning tab.](common/provisioning.png)

1. Set the **Provisioning Mode** to **Automatic**.

	![Screenshot of Provisioning tab automatic.](common/provisioning-automatic.png)

1. Under the **Admin Credentials** section, input your Torii Tenant URL and Secret Token. Select **Test Connection** to ensure Microsoft Entra ID can connect to Torii. If the connection fails, ensure your Torii account has Admin permissions and try again.

 	![Screenshot of Token.](common/provisioning-testconnection-tenanturltoken.png)

1. In the **Notification Email** field, enter the email address of a person or group who should receive the provisioning error notifications and select the **Send an email notification when a failure occurs** check box.

	![Screenshot of Notification Email.](common/provisioning-notification-email.png)

1. Select **Save**.

1. Under the **Mappings** section, select **Synchronize Microsoft Entra users to Torii**.

1. Review the user attributes that are synchronized from Microsoft Entra ID to Torii in the **Attribute-Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the user accounts in Torii for update operations. If you choose to change the [matching target attribute](~/identity/app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes.md), you need to ensure that the Torii API supports filtering users based on that attribute. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.

   |Attribute|Type|Supported for filtering|Required by Torii|
   |---|---|---|---|
   |userName|String|&check;|&check;
   |active|Boolean||
   |name.givenName|String||
   |name.familyName|String||
   |userType|String||

   >[!NOTE]
   >* **userName** must be a valid email address with a valid domain.
   >* **userType**(role in Torii):
   >  * It must be exactly as appear at Torii
   >  * If **userType** is empty, the user gets the **Employee** role as the default.
   >  * The user types(roles) appear [here](https://support.toriihq.com/hc/en-us/articles/6174005637787#h_01G6FRWNXDJG89HCBD93PNYW4H).
   >  * Only admin users (not from type "Employee") is displayed in Torii's UI
	>* Read more about Torii's attributes [here](https://support.toriihq.com/hc/en-us/articles/9183460072347-Torii-s-SCIM-User-Provisioning#heading-3).

1. To configure scoping filters, refer to the following instructions provided in the [Scoping filter  article](~/identity/app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).

1. To enable the Microsoft Entra provisioning service for Torii, change the **Provisioning Status** to **On** in the **Settings** section.

	![Screenshot of Provisioning Status Toggled On.](common/provisioning-toggle-on.png)

1. Define the users that you would like to provision to Torii by choosing the desired values in **Scope** in the **Settings** section.

	![Screenshot of Provisioning Scope.](common/provisioning-scope.png)

1. When you're ready to provision, select **Save**.

	![Screenshot of Saving Provisioning Configuration.](common/provisioning-configuration-save.png)

This operation starts the initial synchronization cycle of all users defined in **Scope** in the **Settings** section. The initial cycle takes longer to perform than subsequent cycles, which occur approximately every 40 minutes as long as the Microsoft Entra provisioning service is running. 

## Step 6: Monitor your deployment

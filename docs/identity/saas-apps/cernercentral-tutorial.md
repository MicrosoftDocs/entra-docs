## Configure Cerner Central SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Cerner Central** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [Cerner Central support team](mailto:SISupport@cbre.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Cerner Central test user

**Cerner Central** application allows authentication from any federated identity provider. If a user is able to sign in to the application home page, they are federated and have no need for any manual provisioning. You can find more details [here](cernercentral-provisioning-tutorial.md) on how to configure automatic user provisioning.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Cerner Central for which you set up the SSO.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the Cerner Central tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the Cerner Central for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

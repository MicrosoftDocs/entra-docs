# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra integration with BambooHR

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate BambooHR with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate BambooHR with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to BambooHR.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to BambooHR with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* BambooHR single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* BambooHR supports **SP** initiated SSO

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.


## Adding BambooHR from the gallery

To configure the integration of BambooHR into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add BambooHR from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **BambooHR** in the search box.
1. Select **BambooHR** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for BambooHR

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with BambooHR using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in BambooHR.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with BambooHR, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    * **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with Britta Simon.
    * **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
2. **[Configure BambooHR SSO](#configure-bamboohr-sso)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
    * **[Create BambooHR test user](#create-bamboohr-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in BambooHR that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
3. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Next steps

Once you configure BambooHR you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

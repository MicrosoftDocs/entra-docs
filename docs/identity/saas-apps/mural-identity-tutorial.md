## Add Mural Identity from the gallery

To configure the integration of Mural Identity into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Mural Identity from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Mural Identity** in the search box.
1. Select **Mural Identity** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Mural Identity

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Mural Identity using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Mural Identity.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Mural Identity, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Mural Identity SSO](#configure-mural-identity-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Mural Identity test user](#create-mural-identity-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Mural Identity that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, the user doesn't have to perform any step as the app is already pre-integrated with Azure.

1. Mural Identity application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![image](common/default-attributes.png)

1. In addition to above, Mural Identity application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.
	
	| Name | Source Attribute|
	| -------- | --------- |
	| email | user.userprincipalname |
    | FirstName | user.givenname |
    | LastName | user.surname |

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Certificate (PEM)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

### Create Mural Identity test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in Mural Identity. Mural Identity supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Mural Identity, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to Mural Identity Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Mural Identity Sign on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Mural Identity for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the Mural Identity tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign-on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Mural Identity for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

## Change log

# Tutorial: Integrate Secret Server (On-Premises) with Microsoft Entra ID

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Secret Server (On-Premises) with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Secret Server (On-Premises) with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Secret Server (On-Premises).
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Secret Server (On-Premises) with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Secret Server (On-Premises) single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Secret Server (On-Premises) supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.

## Add Secret Server (On-Premises) from the gallery

To configure the integration of Secret Server (On-Premises) into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Secret Server (On-Premises) from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Secret Server (On-Premises)** in the search box.
1. Select **Secret Server (On-Premises)** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Secret Server (On-Premises)

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Secret Server (On-Premises) using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Secret Server (On-Premises).

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Secret Server (On-Premises), perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Secret Server (On-Premises) SSO](#configure-secret-server-on-premises-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Secret Server (On-Premises) test user](#create-secret-server-on-premises-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Secret Server (On-Premises) that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

   1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Secret Server (On-Premises) SSO

To configure single sign-on on the **Secret Server (On-Premises)** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and appropriate copied URLs to the [Secret Server (On-Premises) support team](https://support.delinea.com/s/). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Secret Server (On-Premises) test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Secret Server (On-Premises). Work withÂ [Secret Server (On-Premises) support team](https://support.delinea.com/s/) to add the users in the Secret Server (On-Premises) platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Secret Server (On-Premises) Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Secret Server (On-Premises) Sign on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Secret Server (On-Premises) for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the Secret Server (On-Premises) tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign-on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Secret Server (On-Premises) for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure Secret Server (On-Premises) you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâs sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

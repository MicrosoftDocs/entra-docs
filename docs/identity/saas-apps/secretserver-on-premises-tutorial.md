# Tutorial: Integrate Secret Server with Microsoft Entra ID

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Secret Server with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Secret Server  with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Secret Server.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Secret Server with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Secret Server single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Secret Server supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.

## Add Secret Server from the gallery

To configure the integration of Secret Server into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Secret Server from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
2. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
3. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Secret Server** in the search box.
4. Select **Secret Server** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Secret Server

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Secret Server using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Secret Server.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Secret Server, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    2. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
2. **[Configure Secret Server SSO](#configure-secret-server-on-premises-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Secret Server test user](#create-secret-server-on-premises-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Secret Server that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
3. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type the URL:
    `https://secretserveronpremises.azure`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<SecretServerURL>/SAML/AssertionConsumerService.aspx`

    > [!NOTE]
	> The Entity ID shown above is an example only and you are free to choose any unique value that identifies your Secret Server instance in Microsoft Entra ID. You need to send this Entity ID to [Secret Server Client support team](https://support.delinea.com/s/) and they configure it on their side. For more details, please read [this article](https://docs.delinea.com/secrets/current/authentication/configuring-saml-sso/index.md).

6. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<SecretServerURL>/login.aspx`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Reply URL and Sign-On URL. Contact [Secret Server Client support team](https://support.delinea.com/s/) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section.

7. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Certificate (Base64)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

### Assign the Microsoft Entra test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use single sign-on by granting access to Secret Server.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
2. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **Secret Server**.
3. In the app's overview page, select **Users and groups**.
4. Select **Add user/group**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
   1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
   2. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
   3. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Secret Server SSO

To configure single sign-on on the **Secret Server** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and appropriate copied URLs to the [Secret Server support team](https://support.delinea.com/s/). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Secret Server test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Secret Server. Work withÂ [Secret Server support team](https://support.delinea.com/s/) to add the users in the Secret Server platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Secret Server  Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Secret Server  Sign on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Secret Server  for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the Secret Server  tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign-on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Secret Server  for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure Secret Server  you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâs sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

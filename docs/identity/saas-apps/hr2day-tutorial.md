# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with HR2day by Merces

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate HR2day by Merces with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate HR2day by Merces with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to HR2day by Merces.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to HR2day by Merces with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To configure Microsoft Entra integration with HR2day by Merces, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a Microsoft Entra environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* HR2day by Merces single sign-on enabled subscription.
* Along with Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator can also add or manage applications in Microsoft Entra ID.
For more information, see [Azure built-in roles](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md).

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* HR2day by Merces supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Add HR2day by Merces from the gallery

To configure the integration of HR2day by Merces into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add HR2day by Merces from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure HR2day by Merces SSO](#configure-hr2day-by-merces-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create HR2day by Merces test user](#create-hr2day-by-merces-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in HR2day by Merces that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure HR2day by Merces SSO

To configure single sign-on on **HR2day by Merces** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [HR2day by Merces support team](mailto:servicedesk@merces.nl). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

> [!NOTE]
> Mention to the Merces team that this integration needs the Entity ID to be set with the pattern **https:\//hr2day.force.com/INSTANCENAME**.

### Create HR2day by Merces test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in HR2day by Merces. Work with [HR2day by Merces support team](mailto:servicedesk@merces.nl) to add the users in the HR2day by Merces platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

> [!NOTE]
> If you need to create a user manually, contact the [HR2day by Merces client support team](mailto:servicedesk@merces.nl).

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to HR2day by Merces Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to HR2day by Merces Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the HR2day by Merces tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to HR2day by Merces Sign-on URL. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

## Next steps

Once you configure HR2day by Merces you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

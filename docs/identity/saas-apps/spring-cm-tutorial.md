# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra integration with SpringCM

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate SpringCM with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate SpringCM with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to SpringCM.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to SpringCM with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To configure Microsoft Entra integration with SpringCM, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a Microsoft Entra environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* SpringCM single sign-on enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* SpringCM supports **SP** initiated SSO.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add SpringCM from the gallery

To configure the integration of SpringCM into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add SpringCM from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **SpringCM** in the search box.
1. Select **SpringCM** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for SpringCM

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with SpringCM using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in SpringCM.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with SpringCM, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure SpringCM SSO](#configure-springcm-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create SpringCM test user](#create-springcm-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in SpringCM that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can use any other SpringCM user account creation tools or APIs provided by SpringCM to provision Microsoft Entra user accounts.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to SpringCM Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to SpringCM Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the SpringCM tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to SpringCM Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure SpringCM you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

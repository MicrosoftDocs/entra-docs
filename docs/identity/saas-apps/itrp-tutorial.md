# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with ITRP

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate ITRP with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate ITRP with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to ITRP.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to ITRP with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To configure Microsoft Entra integration with ITRP, you need to have:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a Microsoft Entra environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* An ITRP subscription that has single sign-on enabled.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you'll configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* ITRP supports SP-initiated SSO.

## Add ITRP from the gallery

To configure the integration of ITRP into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add ITRP from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **ITRP** in the search box.
1. Select **ITRP** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for ITRP

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with ITRP using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in ITRP.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with ITRP, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure ITRP SSO](#configure-itrp-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create an ITRP test user](#create-an-itrp-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in ITRP that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to ITRP Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to ITRP Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the ITRP tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to ITRP Sign-on URL. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

## Next steps

Once you configure ITRP you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

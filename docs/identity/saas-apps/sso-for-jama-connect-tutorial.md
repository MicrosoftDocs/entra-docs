1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

	a. In the **Identifier** textbox, type a value using the following pattern:
	`urn:auth0:<First_Part_of_Auth0_Domain>:<TenantID>`

    b. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<Auth0_Domain>/login/callback?connection=<TenantID>`

1. Perform the following step, if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

	In the **Sign on URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
	`https://<Tenant_Name>.jamacloud.com/login.req`

	> [!NOTE]
    > These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Sign on URL. Contact [SSO for Jama Connect® support team](mailto:support@jamasoftware.zendesk.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section.

## Configure SSO for Jama Connect® SSO

To configure single sign-on on **SSO for Jama Connect®** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [SSO for Jama Connect® support team](mailto:support@jamasoftware.zendesk.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create SSO for Jama Connect® test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in SSO for Jama Connect®. SSO for Jama Connect® supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in SSO for Jama Connect®, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to SSO for Jama Connect® Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to SSO for Jama Connect® Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the SSO for Jama Connect® for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the SSO for Jama Connect® tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign-on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the SSO for Jama Connect® for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

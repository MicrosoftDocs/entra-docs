## Adding LabLog from the gallery

To configure the integration of LabLog into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add LabLog from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **LabLog** in the search box.

### Create LabLog test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in LabLog. LabLog supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in LabLog, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to LabLog Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to LabLog Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the LabLog tile in the My Apps, this option redirects to LabLog Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra integration with Trakstar

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Trakstar with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Trakstar with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Trakstar.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Trakstar with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To configure Microsoft Entra integration with Trakstar, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a Microsoft Entra environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Trakstar single sign-on enabled subscription.
* SSO is a paid feature in Trakstar. To enable it for your organization, reach out to [Trakstar Client support team](mailto:support@trakstar.com).

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* Trakstar supports **SP** initiated SSO.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add Trakstar from the gallery

To configure the integration of Trakstar into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Trakstar from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Trakstar** in the search box.
1. Select **Trakstar** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Trakstar

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Trakstar using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Trakstar.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Trakstar, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Trakstar SSO](#configure-trakstar-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Trakstar test user](#create-trakstar-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Trakstar that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

4. In the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, enter the following values in the corresponding input fields:

	| Field name | Value | Note | 
	| ---------------------- | ----- | ---- |
	| **Reply URL (Assertion Consumer Service URL)** | `https://perform.trakstar.com/auth/saml/callback?namespace=<YOUR_NAMESPACE>` | Replace `<YOUR_NAMESPACE>` with a real value, which is visible in the **ACS (Consumer) URL** field in Trakstar Perform. See the note that appears after this table. |
	| **Sign on URL** | `https://perform.trakstar.com/auth/saml/?namespace=<YOUR_NAMESPACE>` | This URL is _similar_ to the preceding URL, but it doesn't have the `/callback` portion. |
	| **Identifier (Entity ID)** | `https://perform.trakstar.com` | |
	
	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are only examples. You must use the values that are specific to your namespace in Trakstar Perform, which are visible by signing into the application and going to **Settings** > **Authentication & SSO** > **SAML 2.0** > **Configure**.
	> 
	> If you don't see the **Authentication & SSO** tab in **Settings**, you might not have the feature, and you should contact Trakstar customer support. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section.

1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Certificate (Base64)** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

   1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Trakstar SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Trakstar** side, you need to sign in as an Administrator and enter the content of downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal. They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Trakstar test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Trakstar. Work with Trakstar Administrator to add the users in the Trakstar platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Trakstar Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Trakstar Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Trakstar tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Trakstar Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure Trakstar you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with Grok Learning

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Grok Learning with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Grok Learning with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Grok Learning.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Grok Learning with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Grok Learning single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.
* Along with Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator can also add or manage applications in Microsoft Entra ID.
For more information, see [Azure built-in roles](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md).

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Grok Learning supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.
* Grok Learning supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Add Grok Learning from the gallery

To configure the integration of Grok Learning into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Grok Learning from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Grok Learning** in the search box.
1. Select **Grok Learning** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Grok Learning

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Grok Learning using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Grok Learning.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Grok Learning, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Grok Learning SSO](#configure-grok-learning-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Grok Learning test user](#create-grok-learning-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Grok Learning that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **Grok Learning** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Screenshot shows to edit Basic S A M L Configuration.](common/edit-urls.png "Basic Configuration")

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.groklearning.com/sso/saml2/metadata`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.groklearning.com/sso/saml2/acs`

1. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.groklearning.com/sso/saml2/login?idp=<IDP_NAME>`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Sign-on URL. Contact [Grok Learning Client support team](mailto:sso-support@groklearning.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section.

1. Grok Learning application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![Screenshot shows the image of attributes.](common/default-attributes.png "Image")

1. In addition to above, Grok Learning application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.

	| Name | Source Attribute|
	| ------------ | --------- |
	| gn | user.givenname |
	| sn | user.surname |
	| mail | user.mail |
	| cn | user.displayname |
    | emailaddress | user.userprincipalname |
    | group | user.groups |
    | Unique User Identifier | user.objectid |

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, In the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click copy button to copy **App Federation Metadata Url** and save it on your computer.

1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you're expecting any role value in the SAML assertion, in the **Select Role** dialog, select the appropriate role for the user from the list and then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Grok Learning SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Grok Learning** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [Grok Learning support team](mailto:sso-support@groklearning.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Grok Learning test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in Grok Learning. Grok Learning supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Grok Learning, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Grok Learning Sign-On URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Grok Learning Sign-On URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Grok Learning for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the Grok Learning tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application Sign-On page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Grok Learning for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

## Next steps

Once you configure Grok Learning you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

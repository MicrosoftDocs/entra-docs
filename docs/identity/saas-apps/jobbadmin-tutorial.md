# Configure Jobbadmin for Single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID

In this article,  you learn how to integrate Jobbadmin with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Jobbadmin with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Jobbadmin.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Jobbadmin with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Jobbadmin single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.
* Along with Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator can also add or manage applications in Microsoft Entra ID.
For more information, see [Azure built-in roles](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md).

## Scenario description

In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* Jobbadmin supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Add Jobbadmin from the gallery

To configure the integration of Jobbadmin into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Jobbadmin from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Jobbadmin** in the search box.
1. Select **Jobbadmin** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Jobbadmin SSO](#configure-jobbadmin-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Jobbadmin test user](#create-jobbadmin-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Jobbadmin that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.

## Configure Jobbadmin SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Jobbadmin** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [Jobbadmin support team](https://grade.zammad.com/help). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Jobbadmin test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Jobbadmin. Work with [Jobbadmin support team](https://grade.zammad.com/help) to add the users in the Jobbadmin platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to Jobbadmin Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Jobbadmin Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the Jobbadmin tile in the My Apps, this option redirects to Jobbadmin Sign-on URL. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

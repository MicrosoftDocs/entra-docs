## Configure MiHCM SSO

To configure single sign-on on **MiHCM** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [MiHCM support team](mailto:support@mihcm.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create MiHCM test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in MiHCM. Work with [MiHCM support team](mailto:support@mihcm.com) to add the users in the MiHCM platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to MiHCM Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to MiHCM Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the MiHCM tile in the My Apps, this option redirects to MiHCM Sign-on URL. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

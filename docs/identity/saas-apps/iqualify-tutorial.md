# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with iQualify LMS

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate iQualify LMS with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate iQualify LMS with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to iQualify LMS.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to iQualify LMS with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* iQualify LMS single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.
* Along with Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator can also add or manage applications in Microsoft Entra ID.
For more information, see [Azure built-in roles](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md).

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* iQualify LMS supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.
* iQualify LMS supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Add iQualify LMS from the gallery

To configure the integration of iQualify LMS into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add iQualify LMS from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **iQualify LMS** in the search box.
1. Select **iQualify LMS** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for iQualify LMS

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with iQualify LMS using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in iQualify LMS.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with iQualify LMS, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure iQualify LMS SSO](#configure-iqualify-lms-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create iQualify LMS test user](#create-iqualify-lms-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in iQualify LMS that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Next steps

Once you configure iQualify LMS you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

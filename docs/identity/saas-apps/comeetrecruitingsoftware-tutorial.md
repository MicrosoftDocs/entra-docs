# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra integration with Comeet Recruiting Software

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Comeet Recruiting Software with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Comeet Recruiting Software with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Comeet Recruiting Software.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Comeet Recruiting Software with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Comeet Recruiting Software single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Comeet Recruiting Software supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.
* Comeet Recruiting Software supports [Automated user provisioning](comeet-recruiting-software-provisioning-tutorial.md).

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with Britta Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
2. **[Configure Comeet Recruiting Software SSO](#configure-comeet-recruiting-software-sso)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Comeet Recruiting Software test user](#create-comeet-recruiting-software-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Comeet Recruiting Software that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Comeet Recruiting Software SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Comeet Recruiting Software** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [Comeet Recruiting Software support team](https://support.comeet.co/knowledgebase/adfs-single-sign-on/). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Comeet Recruiting Software test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Comeet Recruiting Software. Work with [Comeet Recruiting Software support team](mailto:support@comeet.co) to add the users in the Comeet Recruiting Software platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

Comeet Recruiting Software also supports automatic user provisioning, you can find more details [here](./comeet-recruiting-software-provisioning-tutorial.md) on how to configure automatic user provisioning.

### Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Comeet Recruiting Software Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.

* Go to Comeet Recruiting Software Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Comeet Recruiting Software for which you set up the SSO

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the Comeet Recruiting Software tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Comeet Recruiting Software for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).


## Next steps

Once you configure Comeet Recruiting Software you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) integration with New Relic by Account

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate New Relic by Account with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate New Relic by Account with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to New Relic by Account.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to New Relic by Account with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

> [!NOTE]
> This document is only relevant if you're using the [Original User Model](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/overview-user-models/) in New Relic. Please refer to [New Relic (By Organization)](new-relic-limited-release-tutorial.md) if you're using New Relic's newer user model.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* New Relic by Account single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* New Relic by Account supports **SP** initiated SSO
* New Relic supports [**automated user provisioning and deprovisioning**](new-relic-by-organization-provisioning-tutorial.md) (recommended).


## Add New Relic by Account from the gallery

To configure the integration of New Relic by Account into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add New Relic by Account from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **New Relic by Account** in the search box.
1. Select **New Relic by Account** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for New Relic by Account

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with New Relic by Account using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in New Relic by Account.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with New Relic by Account, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    * **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    * **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure New Relic by Account SSO](#configure-new-relic-by-account-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    * **[Create New Relic by Account test user](#create-new-relic-by-account-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in New Relic by Account that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Next steps

Once you configure New Relic by Account you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

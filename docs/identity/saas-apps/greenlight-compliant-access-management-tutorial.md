# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) integration with Greenlight Compliant Access Management

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Greenlight Compliant Access Management with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Greenlight Compliant Access Management with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Greenlight Compliant Access Management.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Greenlight Compliant Access Management with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Microsoft Entra ID, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID](~/identity/enterprise-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Greenlight Compliant Access Management single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Greenlight Compliant Access Management supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    * **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    * **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Greenlight Compliant Access Management SSO](#configure-greenlight-compliant-access-management-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    * **[Create Greenlight Compliant Access Management test user](#create-greenlight-compliant-access-management-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Greenlight Compliant Access Management that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

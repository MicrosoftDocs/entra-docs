# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra integration with Learning Pool LMS

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Learning Pool LMS with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Learning Pool LMS with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Learning Pool LMS.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Learning Pool LMS with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* An active subscription to Learning Pool LMS with Single Sign-on.

> [!NOTE]
> When you start a single sign-on project, a member of the Learning Pool LMS Delivery team will guide you through this process. If you are not in contact with a member of the Learning Pool LMS Delivery team, speak to your Learning Pool LMS Account Manager.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Learning Pool LMS supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Adding Learning Pool LMS from the gallery

To configure the integration of Learning Pool LMS into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Learning Pool LMS from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Learning Pool LMS** in the search box.
1. Select **Learning Pool LMS** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Learning Pool LMS

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Learning Pool LMS with an existing Azure user. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Learning Pool LMS.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Learning Pool LMS, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
1. **[Assign a Microsoft Entra user](#assign-an-azure-ad-user)** - to enable that user to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Learning Pool LMS SSO](#configure-learning-pool-lms-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Test SSO

You will be guided through the testing process by the Learning Pool Delivery team.

## Next steps

Once you configure Learning Pool LMS you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

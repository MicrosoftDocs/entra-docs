# Customer intent: As an IT administrator, I want to learn how to configure single sign-on between Microsoft Entra ID and CheckProof so that I can control who has access to CheckProof, enable automatic sign-in with Microsoft Entra accounts, and manage my accounts in one central location.

# Configure CheckProof for Single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID

In this article,  you learn how to integrate CheckProof with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate CheckProof with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to CheckProof.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to CheckProof with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

[!INCLUDE [common-prerequisites.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/common-prerequisites.md)]
* CheckProof single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* CheckProof supports **IDP** initiated SSO.
* CheckProof supports [Automated user provisioning](checkproof-provisioning-tutorial.md).

## Add CheckProof from the gallery

To configure the integration of CheckProof into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add CheckProof from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **CheckProof** in the search box.
1. Select **CheckProof** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for CheckProof

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with CheckProof using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in CheckProof.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with CheckProof, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure CheckProof SSO](#configure-checkproof-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create CheckProof test user](#create-checkproof-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in CheckProof that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the CheckProof for which you set up the SSO.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the CheckProof tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the CheckProof for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

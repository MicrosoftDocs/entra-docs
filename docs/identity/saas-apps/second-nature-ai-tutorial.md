[!INCLUDE [common-prerequisites.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/common-prerequisites.md)]
* Second Nature AI single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Second Nature AI supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Second Nature AI, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-microsoft-entra-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Second Nature AI SSO](#configure-second-nature-ai-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Second Nature AI test user](#create-second-nature-ai-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Second Nature AI that's linked to the Microsoft Entra ID representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a value using the following pattern:
    `urn:auth0:secondnature:<ID>`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://secondnature.auth0.com/login/callback?connection=<ID>`

1. Perform the following step, if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    In the **Sign on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://app.secondnature.ai/?sso-name=<ID>`

You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Microsoft Entra admin center.

### Create Second Nature AI test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in Second Nature AI. Second Nature AI supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Second Nature AI, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.
 
#### SP initiated:
 
* Select **Test this application** in Microsoft Entra admin center. this option redirects to Second Nature AI Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  
 
* Go to Second Nature AI Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.
 
#### IDP initiated:
 
* Select **Test this application** in Microsoft Entra admin center and you should be automatically signed in to the Second Nature AI for which you set up the SSO.
 
You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the Second Nature AI tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign-on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Second Nature AI for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

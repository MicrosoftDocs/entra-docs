## Add ScreenPal from the gallery

To configure the integration of ScreenPal into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add ScreenPal from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **ScreenPal** in the search box.

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in ScreenPal. ScreenPal supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in ScreenPal, a new one is created after authentication. If you need to create a user manually, contact [ScreenPal Client support team](mailto:support@screencast-o-matic.com).

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to ScreenPal Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to ScreenPal Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the ScreenPal tile in the My Apps, this option redirects to ScreenPal Sign-on URL. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

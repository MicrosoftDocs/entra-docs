# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) integration with Wootric

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Wootric with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Wootric with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Wootric.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Wootric with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Wootric single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Wootric supports **IDP** initiated SSO.
* Wootric supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Adding Wootric from the gallery

To configure the integration of Wootric into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Wootric from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Wootric** in the search box.
1. Select **Wootric** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Wootric

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Wootric using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Wootric.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Wootric, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Wootric SSO](#configure-wootric-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Wootric test user](#create-wootric-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Wootric that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Create Wootric test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in Wootric. Wootric supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Wootric, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Wootric for which you set up the SSO

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Wootric tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the Wootric for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).


## Next steps

Once you configure Wootric you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

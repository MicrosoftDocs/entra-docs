To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Appaegis Isolation Access Cloud, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Appaegis Isolation Access Cloud SSO](#configure-appaegis-isolation-access-cloud-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Appaegis Isolation Access Cloud test user](#create-appaegis-isolation-access-cloud-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Appaegis Isolation Access Cloud that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **Appaegis Isolation Access Cloud** > **Single sign-on**.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, the user doesn't have to perform any step as the app is already pre-integrated with Azure.

1. Select **Set additional URLs** and perform the following steps if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    a. In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.appaegis.net`

    b. In the **Relay State** text box, type a value using the following pattern:
    `<RelayState>`

    > [!NOTE]
    > These values aren't real. Update these values with the actual Sign-on URL and Relay State. Contact [Appaegis Isolation Access Cloud Client support team](mailto:support@appaegis.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section.

1. Appaegis Isolation Access Cloud application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

1. In addition to above, Appaegis Isolation Access Cloud application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response which are shown below. These attributes are also pre-populated but you can review them as per your requirements.
	
	| Name | Source Attribute |
	| ---------| --------- |
	| email | user.userprincipalname |

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

### Create Appaegis Isolation Access Cloud test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in Appaegis Isolation Access Cloud. Appaegis Isolation Access Cloud supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Appaegis Isolation Access Cloud, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to Appaegis Isolation Access Cloud Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Appaegis Isolation Access Cloud Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Appaegis Isolation Access Cloud for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the Appaegis Isolation Access Cloud tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Appaegis Isolation Access Cloud for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

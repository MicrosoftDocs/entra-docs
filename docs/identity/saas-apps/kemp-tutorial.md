# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with Kemp LoadMaster Microsoft Entra integration

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Kemp LoadMaster Microsoft Entra integration with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Kemp LoadMaster Microsoft Entra integration with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Kemp LoadMaster Microsoft Entra integration.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Kemp LoadMaster Microsoft Entra integration with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Kemp LoadMaster Microsoft Entra integration single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> This integration is also available to use from Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud environment. You can find this application in the Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud Application Gallery and configure it in the same way as you do from public cloud.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Kemp LoadMaster Microsoft Entra integration supports **IDP** initiated SSO.

## Add Kemp LoadMaster Microsoft Entra integration from the gallery

To configure the integration of Kemp LoadMaster Microsoft Entra integration into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Kemp LoadMaster Microsoft Entra integration from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Kemp LoadMaster Microsoft Entra integration** in the search box.
1. Select **Kemp LoadMaster Microsoft Entra integration** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

In this section, you create a user called B.Simon in Kemp LoadMaster Microsoft Entra integration. Work with [Kemp LoadMaster Microsoft Entra integration Client support team](mailto:support@kemp.ax) to add the users in the Kemp LoadMaster Microsoft Entra integration platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Kemp LoadMaster Microsoft Entra integration for which you set up the SSO.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Kemp LoadMaster Microsoft Entra integration tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the Kemp LoadMaster Microsoft Entra integration for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure Kemp LoadMaster Microsoft Entra integration you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

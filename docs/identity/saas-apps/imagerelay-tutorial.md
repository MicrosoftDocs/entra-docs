# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra integration with Image Relay

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Image Relay with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Image Relay with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Image Relay.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Image Relay with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Image Relay single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* Image Relay supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Add Image Relay from the gallery

To configure the integration of Image Relay into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Image Relay from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Image Relay** in the search box.
1. Select **Image Relay** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Image Relay

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Image Relay using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Image Relay.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Image Relay, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Image Relay SSO](#configure-image-relay-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Image Relay test user](#create-image-relay-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Image Relay that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Next steps

Once you configure Image Relay you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

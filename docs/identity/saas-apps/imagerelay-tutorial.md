## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Image Relay

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Image Relay using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Image Relay.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Image Relay, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Image Relay SSO](#configure-image-relay-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Image Relay test user](#create-image-relay-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Image Relay that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

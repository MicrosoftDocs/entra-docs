In this article,  you learn how to integrate monday.com with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate monday.com with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to monday.com.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to monday.com with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites
The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

[!INCLUDE [common-prerequisites.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/common-prerequisites.md)]
* monday.com single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> This integration is also available to use from Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud environment. You can find this application in the Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud Application Gallery and configure it in the same way as you do from public cloud.

## Scenario description

In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* monday.com supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.
* monday.com supports [**automated** user provisioning and deprovisioning](mondaycom-provisioning-tutorial.md) (recommended).
* monday.com supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Add monday.com from the gallery

To configure the integration of monday.com into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add monday.com from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **monday.com** in the search box.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

### Create monday.com test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in monday.com. monday.com supports just-in-time provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in monday.com, a new one is created when you attempt to access monday.com.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to monday.com Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to monday.com Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the monday.com for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the monday.com tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the monday.com for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

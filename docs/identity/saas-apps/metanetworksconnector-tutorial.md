# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra integration with Meta Networks Connector

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Meta Networks Connector with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Meta Networks Connector with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Meta Networks Connector.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Meta Networks Connector with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Meta Networks Connector single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* Meta Networks Connector supports **SP** and **IDP** initiated SSO.
 
* Meta Networks Connector supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

* Meta Networks Connector supports [Automated user provisioning](meta-networks-connector-provisioning-tutorial.md).

## Add Meta Networks Connector from the gallery

To configure the integration of Meta Networks Connector into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Meta Networks Connector from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Meta Networks Connector** in the search box.
1. Select **Meta Networks Connector** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Meta Networks Connector

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Meta Networks Connector using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Meta Networks Connector.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Meta Networks Connector, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Meta Networks Connector SSO](#configure-meta-networks-connector-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Meta Networks Connector test user](#create-meta-networks-connector-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Meta Networks Connector that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **Meta Networks Connector** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, If you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://login.nsof.io/v1/<ORGANIZATION-SHORT-NAME>/saml/metadata`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://login.nsof.io/v1/<ORGANIZATION-SHORT-NAME>/sso/saml`

5. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

	b. In the **Relay State** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://<ORGANIZATION-SHORT-NAME>.metanetworks.com/#/`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL, and Sign-On URL are explained later in the tutorial.

6. Meta Networks Connector application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes. Click **Edit** icon to open **User Attributes** dialog.

	d. Enable the **Just-in-Time Provisioning**.

### Create Meta Networks Connector test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in Meta Networks Connector. Meta Networks Connector supports just-in-time provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Meta Networks Connector, a new one is created when you attempt to access Meta Networks Connector.

>[!Note]
>If you need to create a user manually, contact [Meta Networks Connector Client support team](mailto:support@metanetworks.com).

Meta Networks also supports automatic user provisioning, you can find more details [here](./meta-networks-connector-provisioning-tutorial.md) on how to configure automatic user provisioning.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Meta Networks Connector Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Meta Networks Connector Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Meta Networks Connector for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the Meta Networks Connector tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Meta Networks Connector for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure Meta Networks Connector you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

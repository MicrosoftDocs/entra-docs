# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with Skills Manager

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Skills Manager with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Skills Manager with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Skills Manager.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Skills Manager with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Skills Manager single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* Skills Manager supports **IDP** initiated SSO.

## Add Skills Manager from the gallery

To configure the integration of Skills Manager into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Skills Manager from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Skills Manager** in the search box.
1. Select **Skills Manager** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Skills Manager

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Skills Manager using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Skills Manager.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Skills Manager, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Skills Manager SSO](#configure-skills-manager-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Skills Manager test user](#create-skills-manager-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Skills Manager that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Skills Manager SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Skills Manager** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [Skills Manager support team](https://www.ibm.com/support/uk/?lnk=msu_uk). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Skills Manager test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Skills Manager. Work with [Skills Manager support team](https://www.ibm.com/support/uk/?lnk=msu_uk) to add the users in the Skills Manager platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Skills Manager for which you set up the SSO.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Skills Manager tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the Skills Manager for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

## Next steps

Once you configure Skills Manager you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with Cincom CPQ

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Cincom CPQ with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Cincom CPQ with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Cincom CPQ.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Cincom CPQ with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Cincom CPQ single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.
* Along with Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator can also add or manage applications in Microsoft Entra ID.
For more information, see [Azure built-in roles](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md).

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Cincom CPQ supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.

## Add Cincom CPQ from the gallery

To configure the integration of Cincom CPQ into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Cincom CPQ from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Cincom CPQ** in the search box.
1. Select **Cincom CPQ** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Cincom CPQ

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Cincom CPQ using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Cincom CPQ.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Cincom CPQ, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
2. **[Configure Cincom CPQ SSO](#configure-cincom-cpq-sso)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Cincom CPQ test user](#create-cincom-cpq-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Cincom CPQ that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
3. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Assign the Microsoft Entra test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use single sign-on by granting access to Cincom CPQ.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **Cincom CPQ**.

1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you're expecting any role value in the SAML assertion, in the **Select Role** dialog, select the appropriate role for the user from the list and then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Cincom CPQ SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Cincom CPQ** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Raw)** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [Cincom CPQ support team](https://supportweb.cincom.com/default.aspx). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Cincom CPQ test user

In this section, you create a user called B.Simon in Cincom CPQ. Work with [Cincom CPQ support team](https://supportweb.cincom.com/default.aspx) to add the users in the Cincom CPQ platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Cincom CPQ Sign-On URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Cincom CPQ Sign-On URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Cincom CPQ for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the Cincom CPQ tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application Sign-On page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Cincom CPQ for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

## Next steps

Once you configure Cincom CPQ you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

# Configure Optimizely for Single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID

An SSO integration between Microsoft Entra ID and Optimizely can be configured in Optimizely's Opti ID Admin Center. Please follow the instructions provided in the Optimizely knowledge base:
[Get started with Opti ID](https://support.optimizely.com/hc/en-us/articles/12613241464461-Get-started-with-Opti-ID)

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to Optimizely Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Optimizely Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the Optimizely tile in the My Apps, this option redirects to Optimizely Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

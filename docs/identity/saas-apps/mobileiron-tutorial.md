# Configure MobileIron for Single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID

 In this article,  you learn how to integrate MobileIron with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate MobileIron with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to MobileIron.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed in to MobileIron with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location: the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites
The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

[!INCLUDE [common-prerequisites.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/common-prerequisites.md)]
* MobileIron single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* MobileIron supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.

## Add MobileIron from the gallery

To configure the integration of MobileIron into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add MobileIron from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **MobileIron** in the search box.
1. Select **MobileIron** from the results, and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for MobileIron

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with MobileIron, by using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a linked relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in MobileIron.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with MobileIron, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with Britta Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable Britta Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
2. **[Configure MobileIron SSO](#configure-mobileiron-sso)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
    1. **[Create MobileIron test user](#create-mobileiron-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in MobileIron that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
6. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

### SP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to MobileIron Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to MobileIron Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

### IDP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the MobileIron for which you set up the SSO.

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the MobileIron tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the MobileIron for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

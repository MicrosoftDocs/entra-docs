## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Nulab Pass (Backlog,Cacoo,Typetalk)

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Nulab Pass (Backlog,Cacoo,Typetalk) using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Nulab Pass (Backlog,Cacoo,Typetalk).

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Nulab Pass (Backlog,Cacoo,Typetalk), perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Nulab Pass SSO](#configure-nulab-pass-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Nulab Pass test user](#create-nulab-pass-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Nulab Pass (Backlog,Cacoo,Typetalk) that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **Nulab Pass (Backlog,Cacoo,Typetalk)** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://apps.nulab.com/signin/spaces/<Space Key>/saml`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://apps.nulab.com/signin/spaces/<Space Key>/saml/callback`

1. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://apps.nulab.com/signin/spaces/<INSTANCE_NAME>`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Sign-on URL. Contact [Nulab Pass (Backlog,Cacoo,Typetalk) Client support team](mailto:support@apps.nulab.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section.

1. Your Nulab Pass (Backlog,Cacoo,Typetalk) application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows an example for this. The default value of **Unique User Identifier** is **user.userprincipalname** but Nulab Pass (Backlog,Cacoo,Typetalk) expects this to be mapped with the user's email address. For that you can use **user.mail** attribute from the list or use the appropriate attribute value based on your organization configuration.

	![image](common/default-attributes.png)

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Certificate (Base64)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

	![The Certificate download link](common/certificatebase64.png)

1. On the **Set up Nulab Pass (Backlog,Cacoo,Typetalk)** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

### Assign the Microsoft Entra test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use single sign-on by granting access to Nulab Pass (Backlog,Cacoo,Typetalk).

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **Nulab Pass (Backlog,Cacoo,Typetalk)**.
1. In the app's overview page, select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user/group**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
   1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
   1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
   1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Nulab Pass SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Nulab Pass (Backlog,Cacoo,Typetalk)** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [Nulab Pass (Backlog,Cacoo,Typetalk) support team](mailto:support@apps.nulab.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Nulab Pass test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Nulab Pass (Backlog,Cacoo,Typetalk). Work withÂ [Nulab Pass (Backlog,Cacoo,Typetalk) support team](mailto:support@apps.nulab.com) to add the users in the Nulab Pass (Backlog,Cacoo,Typetalk) platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Nulab Pass (Backlog,Cacoo,Typetalk) Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Nulab Pass (Backlog,Cacoo,Typetalk) Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Nulab Pass (Backlog,Cacoo,Typetalk) for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the Nulab Pass (Backlog,Cacoo,Typetalk) tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Nulab Pass (Backlog,Cacoo,Typetalk) for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure Nulab Pass (Backlog,Cacoo,Typetalk) you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâs sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

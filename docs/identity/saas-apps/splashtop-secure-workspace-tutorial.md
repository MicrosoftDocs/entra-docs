# Microsoft Entra SSO integration with Splashtop Secure Workspace

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Splashtop Secure Workspace with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Splashtop Secure Workspace with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Splashtop Secure Workspace.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Splashtop Secure Workspace with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Microsoft Entra ID with Splashtop Secure Workspace, you need:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Splashtop Secure Workspace single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Splashtop Secure Workspace supports **SP** initiated SSO.
* Splashtop Secure Workspace supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Add Splashtop Secure Workspace from the gallery

To configure the integration of Splashtop Secure Workspace into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Splashtop Secure Workspace from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Splashtop Secure Workspace** in the search box.
1. Select **Splashtop Secure Workspace** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Splashtop Secure Workspace

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Splashtop Secure Workspace using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Splashtop Secure Workspace.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Splashtop Secure Workspace, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-microsoft-entra-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-a-microsoft-entra-id-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-microsoft-entra-id-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Splashtop Secure Workspace SSO](#configure-splashtop-secure-workspace-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Splashtop Secure Workspace test user](#create-splashtop-secure-workspace-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Splashtop Secure Workspace that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO in the Microsoft Entra admin center.

## Configure Splashtop Secure Workspace SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Splashtop Secure Workspace** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from Microsoft Entra admin center to [Splashtop Secure Workspace support team](mailto:support-ssw@splashtop.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Splashtop Secure Workspace test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in Splashtop Secure Workspace. Splashtop Secure Workspace supports just-in-time provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Splashtop Secure Workspace, a new one is created when you attempt to access Splashtop Secure Workspace.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.
 
* Click on **Test this application** in Microsoft Entra admin center. This will redirect to Splashtop Secure Workspace Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow.
 
* Go to Splashtop Secure Workspace Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.
 
* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Splashtop Secure Workspace tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Splashtop Secure Workspace Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure Splashtop Secure Workspace you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization's sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

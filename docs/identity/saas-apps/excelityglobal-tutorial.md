# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with ExcelityGlobal

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate ExcelityGlobal with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate ExcelityGlobal with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to ExcelityGlobal.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to ExcelityGlobal with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To configure Microsoft Entra integration with ExcelityGlobal, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a Microsoft Entra environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* ExcelityGlobal single sign-on enabled subscription.
* Along with Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator can also add or manage applications in Microsoft Entra ID.
For more information, see [Azure built-in roles](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md).

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* ExcelityGlobal supports **IDP** initiated SSO.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add ExcelityGlobal from the gallery

To configure the integration of ExcelityGlobal into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add ExcelityGlobal from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **ExcelityGlobal** in the search box.
1. Select **ExcelityGlobal** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for ExcelityGlobal

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with ExcelityGlobal using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in ExcelityGlobal.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with ExcelityGlobal, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure ExcelityGlobal SSO](#configure-excelityglobal-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create ExcelityGlobal test user](#create-excelityglobal-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in ExcelityGlobal that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **ExcelityGlobal** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Screenshot shows to edit Basic S A M L Configuration.](common/edit-urls.png "Basic Configuration")

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** page, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type one of the following URLs:

    | **Identifier** |
    |------|
    | **For Production Environment** : `https://ess.excelityglobal.com` |
    | **For Sandbox Environment** : `https://s6.excelityglobal.com` |

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type one of the following URLs:

    | **Reply URL** |
    |----------|
    | **For Production Environment** : `https://ess.excelityglobal.com/ACS` |
    |**For Sandbox Environment** : `https://s6.excelityglobal.com/ACS` |

1. Your ExcelityGlobal application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes, whereas **nameidentifier** is mapped with **user.userprincipalname**. ExcelityGlobal application expects **nameidentifier** to be mapped with **user.mail**, so you need to edit the attribute mapping by clicking on **Edit** icon and change the attribute mapping.

### Assign the Microsoft Entra test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use single sign-on by granting access to ExcelityGlobal.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).

1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure ExcelityGlobal SSO

To configure single sign-on on **ExcelityGlobal** side, you need to send the **Thumbprint value** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [ExcelityGlobal support team](https://www.dayforce.com/contact). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create ExcelityGlobal test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in ExcelityGlobal. Work withÂ [ExcelityGlobal support team](https://www.dayforce.com/contact) to add the users in the ExcelityGlobal platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the ExcelityGlobal for which you set up the SSO.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the ExcelityGlobal tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the ExcelityGlobal for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

## Next steps

Once you configure ExcelityGlobal you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâs sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

# Configure WEDO for automatic user provisioning with Microsoft Entra ID

This article describes the steps you need to perform in both WEDO and Microsoft Entra ID to configure automatic user provisioning. When configured, Microsoft Entra ID automatically provisions and de-provisions users and groups to [WEDO](https://www.wedo.com/) using the Microsoft Entra provisioning service. For important details on what this service does, how it works, and frequently asked questions, see [Automate user provisioning and deprovisioning to SaaS applications with Microsoft Entra ID](~/identity/app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md). 


## Capabilities supported
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create users in WEDO.
> * Remove users in WEDO when they don't require access anymore.
> * Keep user attributes synchronized between Microsoft Entra ID and WEDO.
> * [Single sign-on](wedo-tutorial.md) to WEDO (recommended).

## Prerequisites

The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

* [A Microsoft Entra tenant](~/identity-platform/quickstart-create-new-tenant.md). 
* One of the following roles: [Application Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#application-administrator), [Cloud Application Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#cloud-application-administrator), or [Application Owner](/entra/fundamentals/users-default-permissions#owned-enterprise-applications). 
* WEDO **Enterprise** Subscription.

## Step 1: Plan your provisioning deployment
1. Learn about [how the provisioning service works](~/identity/app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md).
2. Determine who's in [scope for provisioning](~/identity/app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).
3. Determine what data to [map between Microsoft Entra ID and WEDO](~/identity/app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes.md).

## Step 2: Configure WEDO to support provisioning with Microsoft Entra ID

* Reach out to WEDO support at [info@wedo.swiss](mailto:info@wedo.swiss) to get your **Tenant URL** and **Secret Token**. These values are entered in the Tenant URL * field and Secret Token * field in the Provisioning tab of your WEDO application.

## Step 3: Add WEDO from the Microsoft Entra application gallery

Add WEDO from the Microsoft Entra application gallery to start managing provisioning to WEDO. If you have previously setup WEDO for SSO you can use the same application. However, we recommend that you create a separate app when testing out the integration initially. Learn more about adding an application from the gallery [here](~/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal.md). 

## Step 4: Define who is in scope for provisioning 

[!INCLUDE [create-assign-users-provisioning.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/create-assign-users-provisioning.md)]

## Step 5: Configure automatic user provisioning to WEDO 

This section guides you through the steps to configure the Microsoft Entra provisioning service to create, update, and disable users and/or groups in TestApp based on user and/or group assignments in Microsoft Entra ID.

### To configure automatic user provisioning for WEDO in Microsoft Entra ID:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps**

	![Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

1. In the applications list, select **WEDO**.

	![The WEDO link in the Applications list](common/all-applications.png)

3. Select the **Provisioning** tab.

	![Provisioning tab](common/provisioning.png)

4. Set the **Provisioning Mode** to **Automatic**.

	![Provisioning tab automatic](common/provisioning-automatic.png)

5. Under the **Admin Credentials** section, input your WEDO Tenant URL and Secret Token. Select **Test Connection** to ensure Microsoft Entra ID can connect to WEDO. If the connection fails, ensure your WEDO account has Admin permissions and try again.

6. In the **Notification Email** field, enter the email address of a person or group who should receive the provisioning error notifications and select the **Send an email notification when a failure occurs** check box.

	![Notification Email](common/provisioning-notification-email.png)

7. Select **Save**.

8. Under the **Mappings** section, select **Synchronize Microsoft Entra users to WEDO**.

9. Review the user attributes that are synchronized from Microsoft Entra ID to WEDO in the **Attribute-Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the user accounts in WEDO for update operations. If you choose to change the [matching target attribute](~/identity/app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes.md), you need to ensure that the WEDO API supports filtering users based on that attribute. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.

   |Attribute|Type|Supported for filtering|
   |---|---|---|
   |userName|String|&check;|
   |displayName|String|
   |title|String|
   |emails[type eq "work"].value|String|
   |name.givenName|String|
   |name.familyName|String|
   |active|Boolean|
   |preferredLanguage|String|
   |userType|String|

10. To configure scoping filters, refer to the following instructions provided in the [Scoping filter  article](~/identity/app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).

13. To enable the Microsoft Entra provisioning service for WEDO, change the **Provisioning Status** to **On** in the **Settings** section.

	![Provisioning Status Toggled On](common/provisioning-toggle-on.png)

14. Define the users and/or groups that you would like to provision to WEDO by choosing the desired values in **Scope** in the **Settings** section.

	![Provisioning Scope](common/provisioning-scope.png)

15. When you're ready to provision, select **Save**.

	![Saving Provisioning Configuration](common/provisioning-configuration-save.png)

This operation starts the initial synchronization cycle of all users and groups defined in **Scope** in the **Settings** section. The initial cycle takes longer to perform than subsequent cycles, which occur approximately every 40 minutes as long as the Microsoft Entra provisioning service is running.

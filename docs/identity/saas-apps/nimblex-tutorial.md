# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra integration with Nimblex

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Nimblex with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Nimblex with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Nimblex.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Nimblex with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Nimblex single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* Nimblex supports **SP** initiated SSO.

* Nimblex supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Add Nimblex from the gallery

To configure the integration of Nimblex into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Nimblex from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Nimblex** in the search box.
1. Select **Nimblex** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Nimblex

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Nimblex using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Nimblex.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Nimblex, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Nimblex SSO](#configure-nimblex-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Nimblex test user](#create-nimblex-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Nimblex that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Nimblex Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Nimblex Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Nimblex tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Nimblex Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure Nimblex you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

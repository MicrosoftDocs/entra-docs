# Customer intent: As an IT administrator, I want to learn how to configure single sign-on between Microsoft Entra ID and Adstream so that I can control who has access to Adstream, enable automatic sign-in with Microsoft Entra accounts, and manage my accounts in one central location.

# Microsoft Entra SSO integration with Adstream

In this article, you'll learn how to integrate Adstream with Microsoft Entra ID. Adstream is a content management system that provides the ability for multiple teams to collaborate on assets and distribute content. When you integrate Adstream with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Adstream.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Adstream with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

You'll configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on for Adstream in a test environment. Adstream supports only **SP** initiated single sign-on.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Microsoft Entra ID with Adstream, you need:

* A Microsoft Entra user account. If you don't already have one, you can [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* One of the following roles: Global Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator, or owner of the service principal.
* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Adstream single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Add application and assign a test user

Before you begin the process of configuring single sign-on, you need to add the Adstream application from the Microsoft Entra gallery. You need a test user account to assign to the application and test the single sign-on configuration.

### Add Adstream from the Microsoft Entra gallery

Add Adstream from the Microsoft Entra application gallery to configure single sign-on with Adstream. For more information on how to add application from the gallery, see the [Quickstart: Add application from the gallery](~/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal.md).

### Create and assign Microsoft Entra test user

Follow the guidelines in the [create and assign a user account](~/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal-assign-users.md) article to create a test user account called B.Simon.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, and assign roles. The wizard also provides a link to the single sign-on configuration pane.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Complete the following steps to enable Microsoft Entra single sign-on.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **Adstream** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type the URL:
    `https://msft.adstream.com/saml/assert`

    b. In the **Sign on URL** textbox, type the URL:
    `https://msft.adstream.com`

    c. In the **Relay State** textbox, type the URL:
    `https://a5.adstream.com/projects#/projects/projects`

1. On the **Set-up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

## Configure Adstream SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Adstream** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [Adstream support team](mailto:support@adstream.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Adstream test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Adstream. Work with [Adstream support team](mailto:support@adstream.com) to add the users in the Adstream platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Adstream Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Adstream Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Adstream tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Adstream Sign-on URL. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

## Next steps

Once you configure Adstream you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

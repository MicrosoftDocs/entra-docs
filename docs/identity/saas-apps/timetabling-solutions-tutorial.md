# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with Timetabling Solutions

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Timetabling Solutions with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Timetabling Solutions with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Timetabling Solutions.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Timetabling Solutions with their Microsoft Entra accounts.

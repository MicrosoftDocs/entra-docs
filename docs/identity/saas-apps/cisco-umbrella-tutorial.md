# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra integration with Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> This integration is also available to use from Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud environment. You can find this application in the Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud Application Gallery and configure it in the same way as you do from public cloud.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.

## Add Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO from the gallery

To configure the integration of Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO** in the search box.
1. Select **Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO SSO](#configure-cisco-umbrella-admin-sso-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO test user](#create-cisco-umbrella-admin-sso-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure Cisco Umbrella Admin SSO you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

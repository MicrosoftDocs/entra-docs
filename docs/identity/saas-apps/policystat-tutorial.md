# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with PolicyStat

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate PolicyStat with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate PolicyStat with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to PolicyStat.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to PolicyStat with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* PolicyStat single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> This integration is also available to use from Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud environment. You can find this application in the Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud Application Gallery and configure it in the same way as you do from public cloud.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* PolicyStat supports **SP** initiated SSO.

* PolicyStat supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Add PolicyStat from the gallery

To configure the integration of PolicyStat into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add PolicyStat from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **PolicyStat** in the search box.
1. Select **PolicyStat** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for PolicyStat

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with PolicyStat using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in PolicyStat.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with PolicyStat, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure PolicyStat SSO](#configure-policystat-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create PolicyStat test user](#create-policystat-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in PolicyStat that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Create PolicyStat test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in PolicyStat. PolicyStat supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in PolicyStat, a new one is created after authentication.

>[!NOTE]
>You can use any other PolicyStat user account creation tools or APIs provided by PolicyStat to provision Microsoft Entra user accounts.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to PolicyStat Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to PolicyStat Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the PolicyStat tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to PolicyStat Sign-on URL. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

## Next steps

Once you configure PolicyStat you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

# Configure Software AG Cloud for Single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID

In this article,  you learn how to integrate Software AG Cloud with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Software AG Cloud with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Software AG Cloud.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Software AG Cloud with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites
The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

[!INCLUDE [common-prerequisites.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/common-prerequisites.md)]
* Software AG Cloud single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> This integration is also available to use from Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud environment. You can find this application in the Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud Application Gallery and configure it in the same way as you do from public cloud.

## Scenario description

In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Software AG Cloud supports **SP** initiated SSO.
* Software AG Cloud supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Add Software AG Cloud from the gallery

To configure the integration of Software AG Cloud into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Software AG Cloud from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Software AG Cloud** in the search box.
1. Select **Software AG Cloud** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

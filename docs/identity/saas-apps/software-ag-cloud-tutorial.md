# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with Software AG Cloud

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Software AG Cloud with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Software AG Cloud with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Software AG Cloud.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Software AG Cloud with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Software AG Cloud single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> This integration is also available to use from Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud environment. You can find this application in the Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud Application Gallery and configure it in the same way as you do from public cloud.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Software AG Cloud supports **SP** initiated SSO.
* Software AG Cloud supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Add Software AG Cloud from the gallery

To configure the integration of Software AG Cloud into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Software AG Cloud from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Software AG Cloud** in the search box.
1. Select **Software AG Cloud** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Software AG Cloud

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Software AG Cloud using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Software AG Cloud.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Software AG Cloud, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Software AG Cloud SSO](#configure-software-ag-cloud-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Software AG Cloud test user](#create-software-ag-cloud-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Software AG Cloud that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Create Software AG Cloud test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in Software AG Cloud. Software AG Cloud supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Software AG Cloud, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following option. 

Assuming that the Microsoft Azure is configured as a provider in Software AG Cloud, navigate to `www.softwareag.cloud` and click on Login button and enter the environment name. In the next screen, click on "Log in with \<IDP NAME\>" link and enter the credentials. Once authenticated, you will be logged in and taken to the Software AG Cloud home page.

## Next steps

Once you configure Software AG Cloud you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization's sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

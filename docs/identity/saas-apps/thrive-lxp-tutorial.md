They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Thrive LXP test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Thrive LXP. Work with [Thrive LXP support team](mailto:support@thrivelearning.com) to add the users in the Thrive LXP platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

Thrive LXP also supports automatic user provisioning, you can find more details [here](./thrive-lxp-provisioning-tutorial.md) on how to configure automatic user provisioning.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to Thrive LXP Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Thrive LXP Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the Thrive LXP tile in the My Apps, this option redirects to Thrive LXP Sign-on URL.

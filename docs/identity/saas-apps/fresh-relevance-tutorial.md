# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with Fresh Relevance

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Fresh Relevance with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Fresh Relevance with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Fresh Relevance.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Fresh Relevance with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Fresh Relevance single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Fresh Relevance supports **IDP** initiated SSO.

* Fresh Relevance supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Add Fresh Relevance from the gallery

To configure the integration of Fresh Relevance into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Fresh Relevance from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Fresh Relevance** in the search box.
1. Select **Fresh Relevance** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Fresh Relevance SSO](#configure-fresh-relevance-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Fresh Relevance test user](#create-fresh-relevance-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Fresh Relevance that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.

### Create Fresh Relevance test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in Fresh Relevance. Fresh Relevance supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Fresh Relevance, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Fresh Relevance for which you set up the SSO.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Fresh Relevance tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the Fresh Relevance for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure Fresh Relevance you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

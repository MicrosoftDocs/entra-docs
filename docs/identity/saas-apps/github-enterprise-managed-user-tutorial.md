# Customer intent: As an IT administrator, I want to learn how to configure single sign-on between Microsoft Entra ID and GitHub Enterprise Managed User so that I can control who has access to GitHub Enterprise Managed User, enable automatic sign-in with Microsoft Entra accounts, and manage my accounts in one central location.

# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) integration with GitHub Enterprise Managed User

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate GitHub Enterprise Managed User (EMU) with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate GitHub Enterprise Managed User with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to GitHub Enterprise Managed User.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to GitHub Enterprise Managed User with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

> [!NOTE]
> [GitHub Enterprise Managed Users](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/authentication/managing-your-enterprise-users-with-your-identity-provider/about-enterprise-managed-users) is a feature of GitHub Enterprise Cloud which is different from GitHub Enterprise's standard SAML SSO implementation. If you haven't specifically requested EMU instance, you have standard GitHub Enterprise Cloud plan. In that case, please refer to relevant documentation to configure your non-EMU [organisation](./github-tutorial.md) or [enterprise account](./github-enterprise-cloud-enterprise-account-tutorial.md) to authenticate with Microsoft Entra ID.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* GitHub Enterprise Managed User single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* GitHub Enterprise Managed User supports both **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.
* GitHub Enterprise Managed User requires [**Automated** user provisioning](./github-enterprise-managed-user-provisioning-tutorial.md).

## Adding GitHub Enterprise Managed User from the gallery

To configure the integration of GitHub Enterprise Managed User into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add GitHub Enterprise Managed User from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. Type **GitHub Enterprise Managed User** in the search box.
1. Select **GitHub Enterprise Managed User** from results panel and then click on the **Create** button. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Palo Alto Networks - Admin UI

In this section, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with Palo Alto Networks - Admin UI based on a test user called **B.Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Palo Alto Networks - Admin UI needs to be established.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with Palo Alto Networks - Admin UI, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Palo Alto Networks - Admin UI SSO](#configure-palo-alto-networks---admin-ui-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Palo Alto Networks - Admin UI test user](#create-palo-alto-networks---admin-ui-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Palo Alto Networks - Admin UI that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<Customer Firewall FQDN>:443/SAML20/SP`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type the Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL in the following format:
    `https://<Customer Firewall FQDN>:443/SAML20/SP/ACS`

    c. In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<Customer Firewall FQDN>/php/login.php`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier,Reply URL and Sign on URL. Contact [Palo Alto Networks - Admin UI Client support team](https://support.paloaltonetworks.com/support) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section.
	>
	> Port 443 is required on the **Identifier** and the **Reply URL** as these values are hardcoded into the Palo Alto Firewall. Removing the port number will result in an error during login if removed.

    > Port 443 is required on the **Identifier** and the **Reply URL** as these values are hardcoded into the Palo Alto Firewall. Removing the port number will result in an error during login if removed.

1. The Palo Alto Networks - Admin UI application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![image](common/default-attributes.png)

   > [!NOTE]
   > Because the attribute values are examples only, map the appropriate values for *username* and *adminrole*. There is another optional attribute, *accessdomain*, which is used to restrict admin access to specific virtual systems on the firewall.

1. In addition to above, the Palo Alto Networks - Admin UI application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.

	| Name |  Source Attribute|
    | --- | --- |
    | username | user.userprincipalname |
    | adminrole | customadmin |
	| | |

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **Name** value, shown above as _adminrole_, should be the same value as the _Admin role attribute_, which is configured in step 12 of the **[Configure Palo Alto Networks - Admin UI SSO](#configure-palo-alto-networks---admin-ui-sso)** section. The **Source Attribute** value, shown above as _customadmin_, should be the same value as the _Admin Role Profile Name_, which is configured in step 9 of the **[Configure Palo Alto Networks - Admin UI SSO](#configure-palo-alto-networks---admin-ui-sso)** section.  

	> [!NOTE]
    > For more information about the attributes, see the following articles:

### Create Palo Alto Networks - Admin UI test user

Palo Alto Networks - Admin UI supports just-in-time user provisioning. If a user doesn't already exist, it is automatically created in the system after a successful authentication. No action is required from you to create the user.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Palo Alto Networks - Admin UI Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Palo Alto Networks - Admin UI Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Palo Alto Networks - Admin UI tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the Palo Alto Networks - Admin UI for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure Palo Alto Networks - Admin UI you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

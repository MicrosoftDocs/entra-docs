# Configure RingCentral for Single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID

In this article,  you learn how to integrate RingCentral with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate RingCentral with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to RingCentral.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to RingCentral with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites
The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

[!INCLUDE [common-prerequisites.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/common-prerequisites.md)]
* RingCentral single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> This integration is also available to use from Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud environment. You can find this application in the Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud Application Gallery and configure it in the same way as you do from public cloud.

## Scenario description

In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* RingCentral supports **IDP** initiated SSO.

* RingCentral supports  [Automated user provisioning](ringcentral-provisioning-tutorial.md).

## Add RingCentral from the gallery

To configure the integration of RingCentral into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add RingCentral from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **RingCentral** in the search box.
1. Select **RingCentral** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for RingCentral

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with RingCentral using a test user called **Britta Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in RingCentral.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with RingCentral, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    * **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    * **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure RingCentral SSO](#configure-ringcentral-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    * **[Create RingCentral test user](#create-ringcentral-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in RingCentral that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

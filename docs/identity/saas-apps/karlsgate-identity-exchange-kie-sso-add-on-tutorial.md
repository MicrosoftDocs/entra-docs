1. If you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode, then perform the following step:

    In the **Sign on URL** textbox, type the URL:
    `https://portal.karlsgate.com/Identity/Account/Login`

## Configure Karlsgate Identity Exchange (KIE) SSO Add-on SSO

To configure single sign-on on the **Karlsgate Identity Exchange (KIE) SSO Add-on** side, you must send the following information to the [Karlsgate Identity Exchange (KIE) SSO Add-on support team](mailto:help@karlsgate.com).

1. Your KIE account’s configured, non-blank **Public name plate** (as a secondary confirmation of your KIE account) this value is available at: `https://portal.karlsgate.com/Profile/Edit`.

1. Your configured **Identifier (Entity ID)** (to confirm your configured value).

1. Your configured **App Federation Metadata Url**.

1. A list of one (or more) **email domain(s)** (min. 1) for users who will be accessing the Karlsgate Identity Exchange (KIE) SSO Add-on, such as `northwind.com`, `de.contoso.com`, `fr.contoso.com`, and so on. (See note below.)

    > [!NOTE] 
    > Many organizations have one (1) email domain configured for their users. For example, at the fictitious company Northwind, the user "jane.smith@northwind.com" has an email domain of "northwind.com". Some organizations have multiple (2+) email domains configured for their users. For example, at the fictitious company Contoso, the user "erika.mustermann@de.contoso.com" has an email domain of "de.contoso.com", while the user "jean.dupont@fr.contoso.com" has an email domain of "fr.contoso.com".

1. The Karlsgate Identity Exchange (KIE) SSO Add-on support team will use these settings to configure the Karlsgate Identity Exchange (KIE) SSO Add-on application for SAML SSO access.

> [!NOTE]
> You must have an existing KIE account with an SSO eligible subscription to configure SAML SSO access. For SSO access, a KIE user’s email address must match their Microsoft Entra ID email address.

If you have questions, please contact the [Karlsgate Identity Exchange (KIE) SSO Add-on support team](mailto:help@karlsgate.com).

### Create Karlsgate Identity Exchange (KIE) SSO Add-on test user

> [!NOTE] 
> For SSO access, a KIE user’s email address must match their Microsoft Entra ID email address.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

1. Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Karlsgate Identity Exchange (KIE) SSO Add-on Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

1. Go to Karlsgate Identity Exchange (KIE) SSO Add-on Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

1. Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Karlsgate Identity Exchange (KIE) SSO Add-on for which you set up the SSO. 

1. You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the Karlsgate Identity Exchange (KIE) SSO Add-on tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign-on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Karlsgate Identity Exchange (KIE) SSO Add-on for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

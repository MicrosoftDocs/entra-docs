# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with Swit

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Swit with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Swit with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Swit.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Swit with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Swit single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.
* Along with Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator can also add or manage applications in Microsoft Entra ID.
For more information, see [Azure built-in roles](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md).

> [!NOTE]
> This integration is also available to use from Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud environment. You can find this application in the Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud Application Gallery and configure it in the same way as you do from public cloud.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Swit supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Add Swit from the gallery

To configure the integration of Swit into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Swit from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Swit** in the search box.
1. Select **Swit** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Swit

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Swit using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Swit.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Swit, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Swit SSO](#configure-swit-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Swit test user](#create-swit-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Swit that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **Swit** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

   a. In the **Identifier** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
   `https://<OrgName>.swit.io`

   b. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type the URL:
   `https://saml.swit.io/saml/acs`

   c. In the **Sign on URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
   `https://swit.io/auth/login?subdomain=<OrgName>`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update the values with the actual Identifier and Sign on URL. Contact [Swit support team](mailto:help@swit.io) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section.

1. Swit application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![image](common/default-attributes.png)

    > [!Note]
    >  From the above list of default attributes, please replace givenname with **firstname**, surname with **lastname**, name with **username** and delete **emailaddress** claim as per requirements of the Swit application.

1. Below are the optional claims, which can be mapped to the user and passed back in the SAML response based on your requirements.
	
	| Name |  Source Attribute|
	| -------------- | --------- |
    | language | user.preferredlanguage |
    | tel | user.telephonenumber |

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Certificate (Base64)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Swit Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Swit Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Swit tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Swit Sign-on URL. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

## Next steps

Once you configure Swit you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

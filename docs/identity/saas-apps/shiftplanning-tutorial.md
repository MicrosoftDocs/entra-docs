# Configure Humanity for Single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID

In this article,  you learn how to integrate Humanity with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Humanity with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Humanity.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Humanity with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites
The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

[!INCLUDE [common-prerequisites.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/common-prerequisites.md)]
* Humanity single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* Humanity supports **SP** initiated SSO.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add Humanity from the gallery

To configure the integration of Humanity into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Humanity from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Humanity** in the search box.
1. Select **Humanity** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

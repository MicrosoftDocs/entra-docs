# Configure Appian for Single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID

In this article,  you learn how to integrate Appian with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Appian with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Appian.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Appian with their Microsoft Entra accounts.

[!INCLUDE [common-prerequisites.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/common-prerequisites.md)]
* Appian single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> This integration is also available to use from Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud environment. You can find this application in the Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud Application Gallery and configure it in the same way as you do from public cloud.

## Scenario description

In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Appian supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.
* Appian supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Adding Appian from the gallery

To configure the integration of Appian into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Appian from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Appian

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Appian using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Appian.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Appian, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Appian SSO](#configure-appian-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Appian test user](#create-appian-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Appian that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Create Appian test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in Appian. Appian supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Appian, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to Appian Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Appian Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Appian for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the Appian tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign-on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Appian for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

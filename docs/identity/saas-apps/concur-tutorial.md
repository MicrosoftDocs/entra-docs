# Customer intent: As an IT administrator, I want to learn how to configure single sign-on between Microsoft Entra ID and Concur so that I can control who has access to Concur, enable automatic sign-in with Microsoft Entra accounts, and manage my accounts in one central location.

# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) integration with Concur

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Concur with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Concur with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Concur.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Concur with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

> [!NOTE]
> The guidance provided in this article does not cover the new **Manage Single Sign-On** offering that is available from SAP Concur as of mid 2019.
> This new self-service SSO offering relies on **IdP initiated** sign-in which the current gallery app does not allow, due to the **Sign on URL** not being optional.
> The **Sign on URL** must be empty for IdP initiated sign-in via MyApps portal to work as intended.
> For these reason you must start out with a custom non-galleryp application to set up SSO when using the **Manage Single Sign-On** feature in SAP Concur.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Concur single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Concur supports **SP** initiated SSO.
* Concur supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.
* Concur supports [Automated user provisioning](concur-provisioning-tutorial.md).

## Adding Concur from the gallery

To configure the integration of Concur into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Concur from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Concur** in the search box.
1. Select **Concur** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Concur

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Concur using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Concur.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Concur, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
2. **[Configure Concur SSO](#configure-concur-sso)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Concur test user](#create-concur-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Concur that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
3. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Assign the Microsoft Entra test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use single sign-on by granting access to Concur.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).

   1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
   1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
   1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Concur SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Concur** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [Concur support team](https://www.concur.co.in/contact). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

  > [!NOTE]
  > The configuration of your Concur subscription for federated SSO via SAML is a separate task, which you must contact [Concur Client support team](https://www.concur.co.in/contact) to perform.

### Create Concur test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in Concur. Concur supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Concur, a new one is created after authentication.

Concur also supports automatic user provisioning, you can find more details [here](./concur-provisioning-tutorial.md) on how to configure automatic user provisioning.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Concur Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Concur Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Concur tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Concur Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure Concur you can enforce Session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

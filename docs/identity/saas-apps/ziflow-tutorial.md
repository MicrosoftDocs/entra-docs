# Configure Ziflow for Single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID

In this article,  you learn how to integrate Ziflow with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Ziflow with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Ziflow.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Ziflow with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites
The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

[!INCLUDE [common-prerequisites.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/common-prerequisites.md)]
* Ziflow single sign-on enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* Ziflow supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Add Ziflow from the gallery

To configure the integration of Ziflow into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Ziflow from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Ziflow** in the search box.

In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Ziflow SSO](#configure-ziflow-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Ziflow test user](#create-ziflow-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Ziflow that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.

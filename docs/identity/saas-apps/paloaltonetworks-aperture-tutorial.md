# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra integration with Palo Alto Networks - Aperture

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Palo Alto Networks - Aperture with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Palo Alto Networks - Aperture with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Palo Alto Networks - Aperture.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Palo Alto Networks - Aperture with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Palo Alto Networks - Aperture single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* Palo Alto Networks - Aperture supports **SP** and **IDP** initiated SSO.

## Add Palo Alto Networks - Aperture from the gallery

To configure the integration of Palo Alto Networks - Aperture into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Palo Alto Networks - Aperture from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Palo Alto Networks - Aperture** in the search box.
1. Select **Palo Alto Networks - Aperture** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO

In this section, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with Palo Alto Networks - Aperture based on a test user called **B.Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Palo Alto Networks - Aperture needs to be established.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with Palo Alto Networks - Aperture, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
	1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with Britta Simon.
	1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
2. **[Configure Palo Alto Networks - Aperture SSO](#configure-palo-alto-networks---aperture-sso)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
	1. **[Create Palo Alto Networks - Aperture test user](#create-palo-alto-networks---aperture-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Palo Alto Networks - Aperture that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
3. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Create Palo Alto Networks - Aperture test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Palo Alto Networks - Aperture. Work with [Palo Alto Networks - Aperture Client support team](https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/custom/page/page-id/Support) to add the users in the Palo Alto Networks - Aperture platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Palo Alto Networks - Aperture Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Palo Alto Networks - Aperture Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Palo Alto Networks - Aperture for which you set up the SSO 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the Palo Alto Networks - Aperture tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Palo Alto Networks - Aperture for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).


## Next steps

Once you configure Palo Alto Networks - Aperture you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

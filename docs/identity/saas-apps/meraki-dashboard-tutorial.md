[!INCLUDE [common-prerequisites.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/common-prerequisites.md)]
- Meraki Dashboard single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

- Meraki Dashboard supports **IDP** initiated SSO.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Adding Meraki Dashboard from the gallery

To configure the integration of Meraki Dashboard into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Meraki Dashboard from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Meraki Dashboard** in the search box.
1. Select **Meraki Dashboard** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Meraki Dashboard

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Meraki Dashboard using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Meraki Dashboard.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Meraki Dashboard, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
   1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
   1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Meraki Dashboard SSO](#configure-meraki-dashboard-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
   1. **[Create Meraki Dashboard Admin Roles](#create-meraki-dashboard-admin-roles)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Meraki Dashboard that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **Meraki Dashboard** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

   In the **Reply URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
   `https://n27.meraki.com/saml/login/m9ZEgb/< UNIQUE ID >`

   > [!NOTE]
   > The Reply URL value isn't real. Update this value with the actual Reply URL value, which is explained later in the article.

1. Select the **Save** button.

1. Meraki Dashboard application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

   ![image](common/default-attributes.png)

1. In addition to above, Meraki Dashboard application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.

   | Name                                                    | Source Attribute       |
   | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
   | `https://dashboard.meraki.com/saml/attributes/username` | user.userprincipalname |
   | `https://dashboard.meraki.com/saml/attributes/role`     | user.assignedroles     |

   > [!NOTE]
   > To understand how to configure roles in Microsoft Entra ID, see [here](~/identity-platform/howto-add-app-roles-in-apps.md#app-roles-ui).

1. In the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, select **Edit** button to open **SAML Signing Certificate** dialog.

   ![Edit SAML Signing Certificate](common/edit-certificate.png)

1. In the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, copy the **Thumbprint Value** and save it on your computer. This value needs to be converted to include colons in order for the Meraki dashboard to understand it . For example, if the thumbprint from Azure is `C2569F50A4AAEDBB8E` it will need to be changed to `C2:56:9F:50:A4:AA:ED:BB:8E` to use it later in Meraki Dashboard.

   ![Copy Thumbprint value](common/copy-thumbprint.png)

1. On the **Set up Meraki Dashboard** section, copy the Logout URL value and save it on your computer.

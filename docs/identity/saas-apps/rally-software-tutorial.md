# Configure Rally Software for Single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID

In this article,  you learn how to integrate Rally Software with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Rally Software with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Rally Software.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Rally Software with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites
The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

[!INCLUDE [common-prerequisites.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/common-prerequisites.md)]
* Rally Software single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* Rally Software supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Add Rally Software from the gallery

To configure the integration of Rally Software into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Rally Software from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Rally Software** in the search box.
1. Select **Rally Software** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Rally Software, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Rally Software SSO](#configure-rally-software-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Rally Software test user](#create-rally-software-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Rally Software that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

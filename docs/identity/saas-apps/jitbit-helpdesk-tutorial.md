# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra integration with Jitbit Helpdesk

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Jitbit Helpdesk with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Jitbit Helpdesk with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Jitbit Helpdesk.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Jitbit Helpdesk with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Jitbit Helpdesk single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> This integration is also available to use from Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud environment. You can find this application in the Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud Application Gallery and configure it in the same way as you do from public cloud.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* Jitbit Helpdesk supports **SP** initiated SSO.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add Jitbit Helpdesk from the gallery

To configure the integration of Jitbit Helpdesk into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Jitbit Helpdesk from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Jitbit Helpdesk** in the search box.
1. Select **Jitbit Helpdesk** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

### Create Brandfolder test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in Brandfolder. Brandfolder supports **just-in-time user provisioning**, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Brandfolder, a new one is created after authentication.

### Test single sign-on 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you select the Brandfolder tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the Brandfolder for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

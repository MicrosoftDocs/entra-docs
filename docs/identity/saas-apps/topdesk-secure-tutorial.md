# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with TOPdesk - Secure

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate TOPdesk - Secure with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate TOPdesk - Secure with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to TOPdesk - Secure.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to TOPdesk - Secure (Single Sign-On) with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:
 
 * A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* A TOPdesk - Secure single sign-on (SSO)-enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* TOPdesk - Secure supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Add TOPdesk - Secure from the gallery

To configure the integration of TOPdesk - Secure into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add TOPdesk - Secure from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **TOPdesk - Secure** in the search box.
1. Select **TOPdesk - Secure** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for TOPdesk - Secure

In this section, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with TOPdesk - Secure based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in TOPdesk - Secure needs to be established.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with TOPdesk - Secure, you need to perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with Britta Simon.
    2. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
2. **[Configure TOPdesk - Secure SSO](#configure-topdesk---secure-sso)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
    1. **[Create TOPdesk - Secure test user](#create-topdesk---secure-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in TOPdesk - Secure that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the TOPdesk - Secure tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the TOPdesk - Secure for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure TOPdesk - Secure you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra Single sign-on (SSO) integration with Cornerstone

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to set up the single sign-on integration between Cornerstone and Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Cornerstone with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has SSO access to Cornerstone.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Cornerstone with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Enabled SSO in Cornerstone.

> [!NOTE]
> This integration is also available to use from Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud environment. You can find this application in the Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud Application Gallery and configure it in the same way as you do from public cloud.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Cornerstone supports **SP** initiated SSO.

* Cornerstone supports [Automated user provisioning](cornerstone-ondemand-provisioning-tutorial.md).

* If you are integrating one or multiple products from this particular list then you should use this Cornerstone Single Sign-On app from the Gallery.

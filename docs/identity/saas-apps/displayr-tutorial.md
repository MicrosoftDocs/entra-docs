### Restrict access to specific users

By default, all users in the tenant where you added the Displayr application can sign-in to Displayr by using SSO. If you want to restrict access to specific users or groups, see [Restrict your Microsoft Entra app to a set of users in a Microsoft Entra tenant](~/identity-platform/howto-restrict-your-app-to-a-set-of-users.md).

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to Displayr Sign-on URL where you can initiate the sign in flow. 

* Go to Displayr Sign-on URL directly and initiate the sign in flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the Displayr tile in the My Apps, this option redirects to Displayr Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

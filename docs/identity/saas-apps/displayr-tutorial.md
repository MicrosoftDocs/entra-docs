# Tutorial: Integrate Displayr with Microsoft Entra ID

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Displayr with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Displayr with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Displayr.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Displayr with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Displayr single sign-on (SSO) enabled company.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you will learn to configure Microsoft Entra SSO in your Displayr company.

* Displayr supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Add Displayr from the gallery

To configure the integration of Displayr into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Displayr from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Displayr** in the search box.
1. Select **Displayr** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

### Restrict access to specific users

By default, all users in the tenant where you added the Displayr application can log in to Displayr by using SSO. If you want to restrict access to specific users or groups, see [Restrict your Microsoft Entra app to a set of users in a Microsoft Entra tenant](~/identity-platform/howto-restrict-your-app-to-a-set-of-users.md).

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Displayr Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Displayr Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Displayr tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Displayr Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure Displayr you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

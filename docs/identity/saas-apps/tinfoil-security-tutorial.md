## Add TINFOIL SECURITY from the gallery

To configure the integration of TINFOIL SECURITY into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add TINFOIL SECURITY from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **TINFOIL SECURITY** in the search box.
1. Select **TINFOIL SECURITY** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

### Create TINFOIL SECURITY test user

In order to enable Microsoft Entra users to sign in to TINFOIL SECURITY, they must be provisioned into TINFOIL SECURITY. In the case of TINFOIL SECURITY, provisioning is a manual task.

**To get a user provisioned, perform the following steps:**

1. If the user is a part of an Enterprise account, you need to [contact the TINFOIL SECURITY support team](https://www.tinfoilsecurity.com/contact) to get the user account created.

1. If the user is a regular TINFOIL SECURITY SaaS user, then the user can add a collaborator to any of the user’s sites. This triggers a process to send an invitation to the specified email to create a new TINFOIL SECURITY user account.

> [!NOTE]
> You can use any other TINFOIL SECURITY user account creation tools or APIs provided by TINFOIL SECURITY to provision Microsoft Entra user accounts.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the TINFOIL SECURITY for which you set up the SSO.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the TINFOIL SECURITY tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the TINFOIL SECURITY for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) integration with Fluxx Labs

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Fluxx Labs with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Fluxx Labs with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Fluxx Labs.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Fluxx Labs with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Fluxx Labs single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Fluxx Labs supports **IDP** initiated SSO.

## Add Fluxx Labs from the gallery

To configure the integration of Fluxx Labs into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Fluxx Labs from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Fluxx Labs** in the search box.
1. Select **Fluxx Labs** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Fluxx Labs SSO](#configure-fluxx-labs-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Fluxx Labs test user](#create-fluxx-labs-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Fluxx Labs that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Fluxx Labs tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the Fluxx Labs for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure Fluxx Labs you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

# Customer intent: As an IT administrator, I want to learn how to configure single sign-on between Microsoft Entra ID and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console so that I can control who has access to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console, enable automatic sign-in with Microsoft Entra accounts, and manage my accounts in one central location.

# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> This integration is also available to use from Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud environment. You can find this application in the Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud Application Gallery and configure it in the same way as you do from public cloud.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console supports **SP** initiated SSO.
* Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console supports [**Automated** user provisioning and deprovisioning](oracle-cloud-infrastructure-console-provisioning-tutorial.md) (recommended).

## Add Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console from the gallery

To configure the integration of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console** in the search box.
1. Select **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console using a test user called **B. Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** to enable your users to use this feature.
   1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B. Simon.
   1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** to enable B. Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console SSO](#configure-oracle-cloud-infrastructure-console-sso)** to configure the SSO settings on application side.
   1. **[Create Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console test user](#create-oracle-cloud-infrastructure-console-test-user)** to have a counterpart of B. Simon in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

   > [!NOTE]
   > You will get the Service Provider metadata file from the **Configure Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console Single Sign-On** section of the tutorial.
	
   1. Click **Upload metadata file**.

   1. Click on **folder logo** to select the metadata file and click **Upload**.

   1. Once the metadata file is successfully uploaded, the **Identifier** and **Reply URL** values get auto populated in **Basic SAML Configuration** section textbox.
	
      > [!NOTE]
      > If the **Identifier** and **Reply URL** values do not get auto populated, then fill in the values manually according to your requirement.

      In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
      `https://cloud.oracle.com/?region=<REGIONNAME>`

      > [!NOTE]
      > The value is not real. Update the value with the actual Sign-On URL. Contact [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console Client support team](https://www.oracle.com/support/advanced-customer-services/cloud/) to get the value. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section.

1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

   ![The Certificate download link](common/metadataxml.png)

1. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes. Click **Edit** icon to open User Attributes dialog.

   ![image1](common/edit-attribute.png)

1. In addition to above, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response. In the **User Attributes & Claims** section on the **Group Claims (Preview)** dialog, perform the following steps:

   1. Click the **pen** next to **Name identifier value**.

   1. Select **Persistent** as **Choose name identifier format**.
 
   1. Click **Save**.

### Create Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console test user

 Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console supports just-in-time provisioning, which is by default. There is no action item for you in this section. A new user does not get created during an attempt to access and also no need to create the user.

## Test SSO

When you select the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console tile in the My Apps, you will be redirected to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console sign-in page. Select the **IDENTITY PROVIDER** from the drop-down menu and click **Continue** as shown below to sign in. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console you can enforce session controls, which protect exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session controls extend from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

# Configure RunMyProcess for Single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID

In this article,  you learn how to integrate RunMyProcess with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate RunMyProcess with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to RunMyProcess.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to RunMyProcess with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites
The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

[!INCLUDE [common-prerequisites.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/common-prerequisites.md)]
* RunMyProcess single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* RunMyProcess supports **SP** initiated SSO.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add RunMyProcess from the gallery

To configure the integration of RunMyProcess into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add RunMyProcess from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **RunMyProcess** in the search box.
1. Select **RunMyProcess** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for RunMyProcess

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with RunMyProcess using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in RunMyProcess.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with RunMyProcess, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure RunMyProcess SSO](#configure-runmyprocess-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create RunMyProcess test user](#create-runmyprocess-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in RunMyProcess that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

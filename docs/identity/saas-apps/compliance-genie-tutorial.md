# Microsoft Entra SSO integration with Compliance Genie

In this article, you'll learn how to integrate Compliance Genie with Microsoft Entra ID. Compliance Genie is an all-in-One Health & Safety App, allowing to manage and keep track of health & safety across your company for risk assessments, incident management, audits and documentation. When you integrate Compliance Genie with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Compliance Genie.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Compliance Genie with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

You'll configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on for Compliance Genie in a test environment. Compliance Genie supports both **SP** initiated single sign-on and also supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Microsoft Entra ID with Compliance Genie, you need:

* A Microsoft Entra user account. If you don't already have one, you can [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* One of the following roles: Global Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator, or owner of the service principal.
* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Compliance Genie single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Add application and assign a test user

Before you begin the process of configuring single sign-on, you need to add the Compliance Genie application from the Microsoft Entra gallery. You need a test user account to assign to the application and test the single sign-on configuration.

### Add Compliance Genie from the Microsoft Entra gallery

### Create and assign Microsoft Entra test user

Follow the guidelines in the [create and assign a user account](~/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal-assign-users.md) article to create a test user account called B.Simon.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, and assign roles. The wizard also provides a link to the single sign-on configuration pane.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **Compliance Genie** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://login.microsoftonline.com/<TenantID>`

    b. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://login.be-safetech.com/Login/AzureAssertionConsumerService/<COMPANYID>`

    c. In the **Sign on URL** textbox, type the URL:
    `https://login.be-safetech.com/Login/Azure`

    > [!NOTE]
    > These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier and Reply URL. Contact [Compliance Genie Client support team](mailto:admin@be-safetech.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click copy button to copy **App Federation Metadata Url** and save it on your computer.

## Configure Compliance Genie SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Compliance Genie** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [Compliance Genie support team](mailto:admin@be-safetech.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Compliance Genie test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in Compliance Genie. Compliance Genie supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Compliance Genie, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Compliance Genie Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Compliance Genie Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Compliance Genie tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Compliance Genie Sign-on URL. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

## Next steps

Once you configure Compliance Genie you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

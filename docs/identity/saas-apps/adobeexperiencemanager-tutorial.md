## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Go to Adobe Experience Manager Sign on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Adobe Experience Manager for which you set up the SSO 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the Adobe Experience Manager tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign-on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Adobe Experience Manager for which you set up the SSO.

# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra integration with Adobe Experience Manager

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Adobe Experience Manager with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Adobe Experience Manager with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Adobe Experience Manager.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Adobe Experience Manager with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Adobe Experience Manager single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Adobe Experience Manager supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO

* Adobe Experience Manager supports **Just In Time** user provisioning

## Adding Adobe Experience Manager from the gallery

To configure the integration of Adobe Experience Manager into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Adobe Experience Manager from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Adobe Experience Manager** in the search box.
1. Select **Adobe Experience Manager** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Adobe Experience Manager

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Adobe Experience Manager using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Adobe Experience Manager.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Adobe Experience Manager, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
2. **[Configure Adobe Experience Manager SSO](#configure-adobe-experience-manager-sso)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Adobe Experience Manager test user](#create-adobe-experience-manager-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Adobe Experience Manager that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
6. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Adobe Experience Manager Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Adobe Experience Manager Sign on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Adobe Experience Manager for which you set up the SSO 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the Adobe Experience Manager tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign-on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Adobe Experience Manager for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).


## Next steps

Once you configure Adobe Experience Manager you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

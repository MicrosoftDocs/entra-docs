# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) integration with JOSA

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate JOSA with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate JOSA with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to JOSA.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to JOSA with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Microsoft Entra ID, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID](~/identity/enterprise-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* JOSA single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* JOSA supports **SP** initiated SSO

## Adding JOSA from the gallery

To configure the integration of JOSA into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add JOSA from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **JOSA** in the search box.
1. Select **JOSA** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on for JOSA

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with JOSA using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in JOSA.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with JOSA, complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    * **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    * **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure JOSA SSO](#configure-josa-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    * **[Create JOSA test user](#create-josa-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in JOSA that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure JOSA SSO

To configure single sign-on on **JOSA** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [JOSA support team](mailto:hr@alldialogue.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create JOSA test user

In this section, you create a user called B.Simon in JOSA. Work withÂ [JOSA support team](mailto:hr@alldialogue.com) to add the users in the JOSA platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the JOSA tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the JOSA for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

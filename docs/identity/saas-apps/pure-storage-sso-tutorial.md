# Microsoft Entra SSO integration with Pure Storage SSO

In this article,  you learn how to integrate Pure Storage SSO with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Pure Storage SSO with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Pure Storage SSO.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Pure Storage SSO with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Microsoft Entra ID with Pure Storage SSO, you need:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Pure Storage SSO single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

* **[Optional]** If you intend to use Signing Certificate & Encrypting Assertion features, you should import your certificate & private key into Pure Storage FlashArray using **precept create--certificate --key "cert-name"**. Use preferred mode of certificate creation, for self signed cert please contact [Pure Storage SSO support team](mailto:security-solutions-support@purestorage.com) for more details.

## Scenario description

In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Pure Storage SSO supports both **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.

## Add Pure Storage SSO from the gallery

To configure the integration of Pure Storage SSO into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Pure Storage SSO from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Pure Storage SSO** in the search box.
1. Select **Pure Storage SSO** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Pure Storage SSO

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Pure Storage SSO using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Pure Storage SSO.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Pure Storage SSO, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-microsoft-entra-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra ID test user](#create-a-microsoft-entra-id-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra ID test user](#assign-the-microsoft-entra-id-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Pure Storage SSO](#configure-pure-storage-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO in the Microsoft Entra admin center.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **Pure Storage SSO** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Screenshot shows how to edit Basic SAML Configuration.](common/edit-urls.png "Basic Configuration")

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<ARRAY-NAME>.purestorage.com/saml2/service-provider-metadata/<SSO_CONFIG_NAME>`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<ARRAY-NAME>.purestorage.com/login/saml2/sso/<SSO_CONFIG_NAME>`

1. Perform the following step, if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<ARRAY-NAME>.purestorage.com/login/saml2/sso/<FQDN_of_Array_Name>`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values aren't real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Sign on URL. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Microsoft Entra admin center.

1. Pure Storage SSO application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![Screenshot shows the image of attributes.](common/default-attributes.png "Image")

1. In addition to above, Pure Storage SSO application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.
	
	| Name | Source Attribute|
	| ---------------| --------------- |
	| purity_roles | user.assignedroles |

    > [!NOTE]
    > Edit default roles in the Microsoft Entra app and update their values as **"storage_admin", "ops_admin", "readonly", "array_admin"** respectively. Refer **"App roles UI - section for updating values"** and **"Assign users and groups to Microsoft Entra roles - section for role assignment" [here](~/identity-platform/howto-add-app-roles-in-apps.md#app-roles-ui)** for more details.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, select copy button to copy **App Federation Metadata Url** and save it on your computer.

	![Screenshot shows the Certificate download link.](common/copy-metadataurl.png "Certificate")

1. On the **Set up Pure Storage SSO** section, copy one or more appropriate URLs based on your requirement.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.
 
#### SP initiated:
 
* Select on **Test this application** in Microsoft Entra admin center. This will redirect to Pure Storage SSO Sign-on URL where you can initiate the sign in flow.  
 
* Go to Pure Storage SSO Sign-on URL directly and initiate the sign in flow from there.
 
#### IDP initiated:
 
* Select on **Test this application** in Microsoft Entra admin center and you should be automatically signed in to the Pure Storage SSO for which you set up the SSO.
 
You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the Pure Storage SSO tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign-on page for initiating the sign in flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Pure Storage SSO for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

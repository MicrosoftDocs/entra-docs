    >[!NOTE]
    >After you assign the user (u2), the created role is automatically attached to the user. If you have created multiple roles, you need to attach the appropriate role to the user as needed. If you want to implement role-based SSO from Microsoft Entra ID to multiple Alibaba Cloud accounts, repeat the preceding steps.

## Configure Role-Based Single Sign-On in Alibaba Cloud Service

1. Sign in to the Alibaba Cloud [RAM console](https://account.alibabacloud.com/login/login.htm?oauth_callback=https%3A%2F%2Fram.console.aliyun.com%2F%3Fspm%3Da2c63.p38356.879954.8.7d904e167h6Yg9) by using Account1.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, select **SSO**.

3. On the **Role-based SSO** tab, click **Create IdP**.

4. On the displayed page, enter `AAD` in the IdP Name field, enter a description in 
the **Note** field, click **Upload** to upload the federation metadata file you downloaded before, and click **OK**.

5. After the IdP is successfully created, click **Create RAM Role**.

6. In the **RAM Role Name** field enter `AADrole`, select `AAD` from the **Select IdP** drop-down list and click OK.

   >[!NOTE]
   >You can grant permission to the role as needed. After creating the IdP and the corresponding role, we recommend that you save the ARNs of the IdP and the role for subsequent use. You can obtain the ARNs on the IdP information page and the role information page.

7. Associate the Alibaba Cloud RAM role (AADrole) with the Microsoft Entra user (u2):

   To associate the RAM role with the Microsoft Entra user, you must create a role in Microsoft Entra ID by following these steps:

   1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/graph-explorer).

   1. Click **modify permissions** to obtain required permissions for creating a role.

       ![Graph config1](./media/alibaba-cloud-service-role-based-sso-tutorial/graph01.png)

   1. Select the following permissions from the list and click **Modify Permissions**, as shown in the following figure.

       ![Graph config2](./media/alibaba-cloud-service-role-based-sso-tutorial/graph02.png)

       > [!NOTE]
       > After permissions are granted, sign in to the Graph Explorer again.

   1. On the Graph Explorer page, select **GET** from the first drop-down list and **beta** from the second drop-down list. Then enter `https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/servicePrincipals` in the field next to the drop-down lists, and click **Run Query**.

       ![Graph config3](./media/alibaba-cloud-service-role-based-sso-tutorial/graph03.png)

       > [!NOTE]
       > If you are using multiple directories, you can enter `https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/contoso.com/servicePrincipals` in the field of the query.

   1. In the **Response Preview** section, extract the appRoles property from the 'Service Principal' for subsequent use.

       ![Graph config4](./media/alibaba-cloud-service-role-based-sso-tutorial/graph05.png)

       > [!NOTE]
       > You can locate the appRoles property by entering `https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/servicePrincipals/<objectID>` in the field of the query. Note that the `objectID` is the object ID you have copied from the Microsoft Entra ID **Properties** page.

   1. Go back to the Graph Explorer, change the method from **GET** to **PATCH**, paste the following content into the **Request Body** section, and click **Run Query**:

       ```json
         {
           "appRoles": [
             {
               "allowedMemberTypes": [
                 "User"
               ],
               "description": "msiam_access",
               "displayName": "msiam_access",
               "id": "41be2db8-48d9-4277-8e86-f6d22d35****",
               "isEnabled": true,
               "origin": "Application",
               "value": null
             },
             {
               "allowedMemberTypes": [
                 "User"
               ],
               "description": "Admin,AzureADProd",
               "displayName": "Admin,AzureADProd",
               "id": "68adae10-8b6b-47e6-9142-6476078cdbce",
               "isEnabled": true,
               "origin": "ServicePrincipal",
               "value": "acs:ram::187125022722****:role/aadrole,acs:ram::187125022722****:saml-provider/AAD"
             }
           ]
         }
       ```

       > [!NOTE]
       > The `value` is the ARNs of the IdP and the role you created in the RAM console. Here, you can add multiple roles as needed. Microsoft Entra ID will send the value of these roles as the claim value in SAML response. However, you can only add new roles after the `msiam_access` part for the patch operation. To smooth the creation process, we recommend that you use an ID generator, such as GUID Generator, to generate IDs in real time.

   1. After the 'Service Principal' is patched with the required role, attach the role with the Microsoft Entra user (u2) by following the steps of **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** section of the tutorial.

### Configure Alibaba Cloud Service (Role-based SSO) SSO

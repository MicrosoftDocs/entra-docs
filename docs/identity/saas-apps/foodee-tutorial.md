# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) integration with Foodee

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Foodee with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Foodee with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Foodee.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Foodee with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Foodee single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Foodee supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.
* Foodee supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.
* Foodee supports [Automated user provisioning](foodee-provisioning-tutorial.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Adding Foodee from the gallery

To configure the integration of Foodee into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Foodee from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Foodee** in the search box.
1. Select **Foodee** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Foodee

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Foodee using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Foodee.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Foodee, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Foodee SSO](#configure-foodee-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Foodee test user](#create-foodee-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Foodee that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Foodee SSO




1. In a different web browser window, sign in to your Foodee company site as an administrator

4. Click on **profile logo** on the top right corner of the page then navigate to **Single Sign On** and perform the following steps:

   ![Foodee configuration](./media/foodee-tutorial/profile-logo.png)

   1. In the **IDP NAME** text box, type the name like ex:Azure.
   1. Open the Federation Metadata XML in Notepad, copy its content and paste it in the **IDP METADATA XML** text box.
   1. Click **Save**.

### Create Foodee test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in Foodee. Foodee supports just-in-time provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Foodee, a new one is created when you attempt to access Foodee.

Foodee also supports automatic user provisioning, you can find more details [here](./foodee-provisioning-tutorial.md) on how to configure automatic user provisioning.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Foodee Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.

* Go to Foodee Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Foodee for which you set up the SSO

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the Foodee tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Foodee for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).


## Next steps

Once you configure Foodee you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

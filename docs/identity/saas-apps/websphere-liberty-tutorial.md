# Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) integration with WebSphere Liberty

- Manage your accounts in one central location: the Azure portal.

## Configure WebSphere Liberty SSO

To complete the OAuth/OIDC federation setup on **WebSphere Liberty** side, you need to send the copied values like  Tenant ID, Application ID, and Client Secret from Entra to [WebSphere Liberty support team](mailto:support@ibm.com). They set this setting to have the OIDC connection set properly on both sides.

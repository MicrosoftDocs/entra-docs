# Microsoft Entra SSO integration with Ledgy

In this article, you learn how to integrate Ledgy with Microsoft Entra ID. Automate your equity. Grant shares and options to employees around the world, integrate equity into all your key systems, and help your team understand their ownership stakes. When you integrate Ledgy with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Ledgy.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Ledgy with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

You configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on for Ledgy in a test environment. Ledgy supports both **SP** and **IDP** initiated single sign-on and **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Microsoft Entra ID with Ledgy, you need:

* A Microsoft Entra user account. If you don't already have one, you can [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* One of the following roles: [Application Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#application-administrator), [Cloud Application Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#cloud-application-administrator), or [Application Owner](/entra/fundamentals/users-default-permissions#owned-enterprise-applications).
* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Ledgy single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Add application and assign a test user

Before you begin the process of configuring single sign-on, you need to add the Ledgy application from the Microsoft Entra gallery. You need a test user account to assign to the application and test the single sign-on configuration.

### Add Ledgy from the Microsoft Entra gallery

Add Ledgy from the Microsoft Entra application gallery to configure single sign-on with Ledgy. For more information on how to add application from the gallery, see the [Quickstart: Add application from the gallery](~/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal.md).

### Create and assign Microsoft Entra test user

Follow the guidelines in the [create and assign a user account](~/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal-assign-users.md) article to create a test user account called B.Simon.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, and assign roles. The wizard also provides a link to the single sign-on configuration pane.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Complete the following steps to enable Microsoft Entra single sign-on.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **Ledgy** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Screenshot shows how to edit Basic SAML Configuration.](common/edit-urls.png "Basic Configuration")

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:
	
	a. In the **Identifier** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
	`https://app.ledgy.com/auth/saml/<orgSlug>/metadata.xml`

	b. In the Reply URL textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
	`https://app.ledgy.com/auth/saml/<orgSlug>/acs`

1. If you wish to configure the application in SP initiated mode, then perform the following step:

	In the **Sign on URL** textbox, type the URL:
	`https://app.ledgy.com/login`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier and Reply URL. Contact [Ledgy Client support team](mailto:support@ledgy.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the Basic SAML Configuration section.

1. Ledgy application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![Screenshot shows the image of attributes configuration.](common/default-attributes.png "Image")

1. In addition to above, Ledgy application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response, which are shown. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.

	| Name |  Source Attribute|
	| ---------------|  --------- |
    | email | user.mail |
	| ID | user.userprincipalname |
	| firstName | user.givenname |
	| lastName | user.surname |

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click copy button to copy **App Federation Metadata Url** and save it on your computer.

## Configure Ledgy SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Ledgy** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [Ledgy support team](mailto:support@ledgy.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Ledgy test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in Ledgy. Ledgy supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Ledgy, a new one is commonly created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Ledgy Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Ledgy Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Ledgy for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the Ledgy tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign-on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Ledgy for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

## Next steps

Once you configure Ledgy you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for InformaCast

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with InformaCast, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure InformaCast SSO](#configure-informacast-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create InformaCast test user](#create-informacast-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in InformaCast that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type the URL:
    `https://admin.icmobile.singlewire.com`

## Configure InformaCast SSO

To configure single sign-on on **InformaCast** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [InformaCast support team](mailto:support@singlewire.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create InformaCast test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in InformaCast. Work with [InformaCast support team](mailto:support@singlewire.com) to add the users in the InformaCast platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

1. Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to InformaCast Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

1. Go to InformaCast Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the InformaCast for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the InformaCast tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the InformaCast for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

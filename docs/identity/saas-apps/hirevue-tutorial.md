1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure HireVue SSO](#configure-hirevue-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create HireVue test user](#create-hirevue-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in HireVue that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

* Go to HireVue Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the HireVue tile in the My Apps, this option redirects to HireVue Sign-on URL. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

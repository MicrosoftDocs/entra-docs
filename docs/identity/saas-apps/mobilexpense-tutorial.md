# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with Mobile Xpense

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Mobile Xpense with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Mobile Xpense with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Mobile Xpense.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Mobile Xpense with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Mobile Xpense single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.
* Along with Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator can also add or manage applications in Microsoft Entra ID.
For more information, see [Azure built-in roles](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md).

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* Mobile Xpense supports **SP** and **IDP** initiated SSO.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add Mobile Xpense from the gallery

To configure the integration of Mobile Xpense into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Mobile Xpense from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Mobile Xpense** in the search box.
1. Select **Mobile Xpense** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Mobile Xpense

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Mobile Xpense using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Mobile Xpense.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Mobile Xpense, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Mobile Xpense SSO](#configure-mobile-xpense-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Mobile Xpense test user](#create-mobile-xpense-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Mobile Xpense that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Assign the Microsoft Entra test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use single sign-on by granting access to Mobile Xpense.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **Mobile Xpense**.

1. Select **Add user/group**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
   1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
   1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
   1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Mobile Xpense SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Mobile Xpense** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [Mobile Xpense support team](https://www.mobilexpense.com/contact). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Mobile Xpense test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Mobile Xpense. Work withÂ [Mobile Xpense support team](https://www.mobilexpense.com/contact) to add the users in the Mobile Xpense platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Mobile Xpense Sign-On URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Mobile Xpense Sign-On URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Mobile Xpense for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the Mobile Xpense tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application Sign-On page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Mobile Xpense for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

## Next steps

Once you configure Mobile Xpense you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâs sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

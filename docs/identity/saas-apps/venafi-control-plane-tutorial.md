# Microsoft Entra SSO integration with Venafi Control Plane - Datacenter

In this article, you'll learn how to integrate Venafi Control Plane - Datacenter with Microsoft Entra ID. The Venafi Control Plane includes TLS Protect Datacenter, SSH Protect and CodeSign Protect. When you integrate Venafi Control Plane - Datacenter with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Venafi Control Plane - Datacenter.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Venafi Control Plane - Datacenter with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

You'll configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on for Venafi Control Plane - Datacenter in a test environment. Venafi Control Plane - Datacenter supports both **SP** and **IDP** initiated single sign-on.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Microsoft Entra ID with Venafi Control Plane - Datacenter, you need:

* A Microsoft Entra user account. If you don't already have one, you can [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* One of the following roles: Global Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator, or owner of the service principal.
* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Venafi Control Plane - Datacenter single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Add application and assign a test user

Before you begin the process of configuring single sign-on, you need to add the Venafi Control Plane - Datacenter application from the Microsoft Entra gallery. You need a test user account to assign to the application and test the single sign-on configuration.

    a. In the **Identifier** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<CUSTOMER-DOMAIN>/aperture/api/saml/acs`

    b. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<CUSTOMER-DOMAIN>/aperture/api/saml/acs`

## Configure Venafi Control Plane - Datacenter SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Venafi Control Plane - Datacenter** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [Venafi Control Plane - Datacenter support team](mailto:support@venafi.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Venafi Control Plane - Datacenter test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Venafi Control Plane - Datacenter. Work with [Venafi Control Plane - Datacenter support team](mailto:Vsupport@venafi.com) to add the users in the Venafi Control Plane - Datacenter platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Venafi Control Plane - Datacenter Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Venafi Control Plane - Datacenter Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Venafi Control Plane - Datacenter for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the Venafi Control Plane - Datacenter tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign-on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Venafi Control Plane - Datacenter for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

## Next steps

Once you configure Venafi Control Plane - Datacenter you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

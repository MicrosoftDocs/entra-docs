# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra integration with Mitel MiCloud Connect or CloudLink Platform

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the Mitel Connect app to integrate Microsoft Entra ID with Mitel MiCloud Connect or CloudLink Platform. The Mitel Connect app is available in the Azure Gallery. Integrating Microsoft Entra ID with MiCloud Connect or CloudLink Platform provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control users' access to MiCloud Connect apps and to CloudLink apps in Microsoft Entra ID by using their enterprise credentials.
* You can enable users on your account to be automatically signed in to MiCloud Connect or CloudLink (single sign-on) by using their Microsoft Entra accounts.

## Prerequisites

To configure Microsoft Entra integration with MiCloud Connect, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a Microsoft Entra environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* A Mitel MiCloud Connect account or Mitel CloudLink account, depending on the application you want to configure.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you'll configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO).

* Mitel Connect supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Adding Mitel Connect from the gallery

To configure the integration of Mitel Connect into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Mitel Connect from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Mitel Connect** in the search box.
1. Select **Mitel Connect** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO

In this section, you'll configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with MiCloud Connect or CloudLink Platform based on a test user named **_Britta Simon_**. For single sign-on to work, a link must be established between the user in Azure portal and the corresponding user on the Mitel platform. Refer to the following sections for information about configuring and testing Microsoft Entra SSO with MiCloud Connect or CloudLink Platform.

## Next steps

Once you configure Mitel Connect you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

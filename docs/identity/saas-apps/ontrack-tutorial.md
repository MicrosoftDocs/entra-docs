* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to OnTrack (Single Sign-On) with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Microsoft Entra ID, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID](~/identity/enterprise-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Microsoft Entra integration with OnTrack, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a Microsoft Entra environment, you can get one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/)
* OnTrack single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* OnTrack supports **IDP** initiated SSO

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with OnTrack based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in OnTrack needs to be established.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with OnTrack, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure OnTrack Single Sign-On](#configure-ontrack-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
5. **[Create OnTrack test user](#create-ontrack-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in OnTrack that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

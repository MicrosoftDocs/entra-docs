# Microsoft Entra SSO integration with Proactis Rego Invoice Capture

In this article, you learn how to integrate Proactis Rego Invoice Capture with Microsoft Entra ID. With Proactis AP automation, you can capture all invoices and convert into eInvoices, validate their accuracy, duplicates and a valid supplier, and then transfer them into your finance system. When you integrate Proactis Rego Invoice Capture with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Proactis Rego Invoice Capture.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Proactis Rego Invoice Capture with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

You configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on for Proactis Rego Invoice Capture in a test environment. Proactis Rego Invoice Capture supports **SP** and **IDP** initiated single sign-on.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Microsoft Entra ID with Proactis Rego Invoice Capture, you need:

* A Microsoft Entra user account. If you don't already have one, you can [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* One of the following roles: Global Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator, or owner of the service principal.
* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Proactis Rego Invoice Capture single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Add application and assign a test user

Before you begin the process of configuring single sign-on, you need to add the Proactis Rego Invoice Capture application from the Microsoft Entra gallery. You need a test user account to assign to the application and test the single sign-on configuration.

	![Screenshot shows to copy configuration appropriate URL.](common/copy-configuration-urls.png "Metadata")

## Configure Proactis Rego Invoice Capture SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Proactis Rego Invoice Capture** side, you need to send the **Certificate (PEM)** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [Proactis Rego Invoice Capture support team](mailto:support@proactis.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Proactis Rego Invoice Capture test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon at Proactis Rego Invoice Capture. Work with [Proactis Rego Invoice Capture support team](mailto:support@proactis.com) to add the users in the Proactis Rego Invoice Capture platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Proactis Rego Invoice Capture Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Proactis Rego Invoice Capture Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Proactis Rego Invoice Capture for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the Proactis Rego Invoice Capture tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign-on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Proactis Rego Invoice Capture for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

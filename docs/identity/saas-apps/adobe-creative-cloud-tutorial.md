# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) integration with Adobe Creative Cloud

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Adobe Creative Cloud with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Adobe Creative Cloud with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Adobe Creative Cloud.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Adobe Creative Cloud with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Adobe Creative Cloud single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Adobe Creative Cloud supports **SP** initiated SSO

## Add Adobe Creative Cloud from the gallery

To configure the integration of Adobe Creative Cloud into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Adobe Creative Cloud from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Adobe Creative Cloud** in the search box.
1. Select **Adobe Creative Cloud** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Adobe Creative Cloud

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Adobe Creative Cloud using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Adobe Creative Cloud.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Adobe Creative Cloud, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Adobe Creative Cloud SSO](#configure-adobe-creative-cloud-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Adobe Creative Cloud test user](#create-adobe-creative-cloud-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Adobe Creative Cloud that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **Adobe Creative Cloud** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, enter the values for the following fields:

	a. In the **Sign on URL** text box, type the URL:
    `https://adobe.com`

    b. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://www.okta.com/saml2/service-provider/<token>`

	> [!NOTE]
	> The Identifier value is not real. Follow the guidance on the step 4 of **Configure Adobe Cloud SSO** section. In that you can open the **Federation Metadata XML file** and get the Entity ID value from it and put that as an Identifier value in Microsoft Entra configuration. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section.

1. Adobe Creative Cloud application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![image](common/edit-attribute.png)

1. In addition to above, Adobe Creative Cloud application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response, which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirement.

	| Name | Source Attribute|
	|----- | --------- |
	| FirstName | user.givenname |
	| LastName | user.surname |
	| Email | user.mail |

	> [!NOTE]
	> Users need to have a valid Microsoft 365 ExO license for email claim value to be populated in the SAML response.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, find **Federation Data XML**, and then select **Download** to download the XML metadata file and save it on your computer.

	![The Certificate download link](common/certificatebase64.png)

1. On the **Set up Adobe Creative Cloud** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

### Create Adobe Creative Cloud test user

In order to enable Microsoft Entra users to sign into Adobe Creative Cloud, they must be provisioned into Adobe Creative Cloud. In the case of Adobe Creative Cloud, provisioning is a manual task.

### To provision a user accounts, perform the following steps:

1. Sign in to [Adobe Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com) site as an administrator.

2. Add the user within Adobe’s console as Federated ID and assign them to a Product Profile. For detailed information on adding users, see [Add users in Adobe Admin Console](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/users.html#Addusers).

3. At this point, type your email address/UPN into the Adobe sign in form, press tab, and you should be federated back to Microsoft Entra ID:
   * Web access: www\.adobe.com > sign-in
   * Within the desktop app utility > sign-in
   * Within the application > help > sign-in

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Adobe Creative Cloud Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Adobe Creative Cloud Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Adobe Creative Cloud tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Adobe Creative Cloud Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure Adobe Creative Cloud you can enforce session control, which protect exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real-time. Session control extend from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

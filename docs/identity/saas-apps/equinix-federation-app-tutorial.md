# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) integration with Equinix Federation App

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Equinix Federation App with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Equinix Federation App with Microsoft Entra ID, you can do the following:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Equinix Federation App.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Equinix Federation App with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Equinix Federation App single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Equinix Federation App supports **SP** initiated SSO.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Adding Equinix Federation App from the gallery

To configure the integration of Equinix Federation App into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Equinix Federation App from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Equinix Federation App** in the search box.
1. Select **Equinix Federation App** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Equinix Federation App

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Equinix Federation App using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Equinix Federation App.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Equinix Federation App, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Equinix Federation App SSO](#configure-equinix-federation-app-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Equinix Federation App test user](#create-equinix-federation-app-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Equinix Federation App that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Equinix Federation App SSO

To configure Single Sign-On on **Equinix Federation App** side, please the follow the [link](https://docs.equinix.com/Content/home.htm).

### Create Equinix Federation App test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Equinix Federation App. Work with [Equinix Federation App support team](mailto:prodsecops@equinix.com) to add the users in the Equinix Federation App platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

Go to Equinix Federation App Sign-on URL directly, and initiate the login flow from there.

 > [!NOTE]
 > If you attempt to test your Azure application by using the **Test this application** link or by clicking the Equinix Federation App tile, it will not work, as that is IdP-initiated SSO, which Equinix does not support by default.  For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).


## Next steps

Once you configure Equinix Federation App you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

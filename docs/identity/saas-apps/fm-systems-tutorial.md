# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with FM:Systems

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate FM:Systems with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate FM:Systems with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to FM:Systems.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to FM:Systems with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To configure Microsoft Entra integration with FM:Systems, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a Microsoft Entra environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* FM:Systems single sign-on enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* FM:Systems supports **IDP** initiated SSO.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add FM:Systems from the gallery

To configure the integration of FM:Systems into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add FM:Systems from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **FM:Systems** in the search box.
1. Select **FM:Systems** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for FM:Systems

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with FM:Systems using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in FM:Systems.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with FM:Systems, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure FM:Systems SSO](#configure-fmsystems-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create FM:Systems test user](#create-fmsystems-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in FM:Systems that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the FM:Systems for which you set up the SSO.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the FM:Systems tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the FM:Systems for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

## Next steps

Once you configure FM:Systems you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

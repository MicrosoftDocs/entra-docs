# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) integration with ThousandEyes

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate ThousandEyes with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate ThousandEyes with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to ThousandEyes.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to ThousandEyes with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* ThousandEyes single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* ThousandEyes supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.
* ThousandEyes supports [**Automated** user provisioning](./thousandeyes-provisioning-tutorial.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add ThousandEyes from the gallery

To configure the integration of ThousandEyes into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add ThousandEyes from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **ThousandEyes** in the search box.
1. Select **ThousandEyes** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for ThousandEyes

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure ThousandEyes SSO](#configure-thousandeyes-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create ThousandEyes test user](#create-thousandeyes-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in ThousandEyes that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to ThousandEyes Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to ThousandEyes Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the ThousandEyes for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the ThousandEyes tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the ThousandEyes for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure ThousandEyes you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

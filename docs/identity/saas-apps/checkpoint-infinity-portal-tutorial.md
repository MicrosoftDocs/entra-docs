# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with Check Point Infinity Portal

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Check Point Infinity Portal with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Check Point Infinity Portal with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Check Point Infinity Portal.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Check Point Infinity Portal with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Check Point Infinity Portal single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Check Point Infinity Portal supports **SP** initiated SSO.

* Check Point Infinity Portal supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add Check Point Infinity Portal from the gallery

To configure the integration of Check Point Infinity Portal into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Check Point Infinity Portal from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Check Point Infinity Portal** in the search box.
1. Select **Check Point Infinity Portal** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

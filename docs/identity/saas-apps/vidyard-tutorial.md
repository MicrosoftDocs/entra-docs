## Configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with Vidyard based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Vidyard needs to be established.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with Vidyard, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure Vidyard Single Sign-On](#configure-vidyard-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
5. **[Create Vidyard test user](#create-vidyard-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Vidyard that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Fexa

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Fexa SSO](#configure-fexa-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Fexa test user](#create-fexa-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Fexa that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

    `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.fexa.io`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:

## Configure Fexa SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Fexa** side, you need to send the **Thumbprint Value** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [Fexa support team](mailto:support@fexa.io). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Fexa test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in Fexa. Fexa supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Fexa, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Fexa for which you set up the SSO.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the Fexa tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the Fexa for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

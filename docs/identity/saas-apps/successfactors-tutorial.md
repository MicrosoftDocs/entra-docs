# Configure SuccessFactors for Single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID

In this article,  you learn how to integrate SuccessFactors with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate SuccessFactors with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to SuccessFactors.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to SuccessFactors with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.


## Prerequisites
The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

[!INCLUDE [common-prerequisites.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/common-prerequisites.md)]
* SuccessFactors single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* SuccessFactors supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Adding SuccessFactors from the gallery

To configure the integration of SuccessFactors into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add SuccessFactors from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **SuccessFactors** in the search box.
1. Select **SuccessFactors** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for SuccessFactors

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with SuccessFactors using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in SuccessFactors.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with SuccessFactors, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
	1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
	1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
2. **[Configure SuccessFactors SSO](#configure-successfactors-sso)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
	1. **[Create SuccessFactors test user](#create-successfactors-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in SuccessFactors that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
3. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

    i. Copy the content of the downloaded certificate file from Azure portal, and then paste it into the **SAML Verifying Certificate** textbox.

    > [!NOTE]

	> [!NOTE]
    > If you try to enable this, the system checks if it creates a duplicate SAML login name. For example if the customer has usernames User1 and user1. Taking away case sensitivity makes these duplicates. The system gives you an error message and doesn't enable the feature. The customer needs to change one of the usernames so itâ€™s spelled different.

### Create SuccessFactors test user

To enable Microsoft Entra users to sign in to SuccessFactors, they must be provisioned into SuccessFactors. In the case of SuccessFactors, provisioning is a manual task.

To get users created in SuccessFactors, you need to contact the [SuccessFactors support team](https://www.sap.com/services-support.html).

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to SuccessFactors Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to SuccessFactors Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the SuccessFactors tile in the My Apps, this option redirects to SuccessFactors Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

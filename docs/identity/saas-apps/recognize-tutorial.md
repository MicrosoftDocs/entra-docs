# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra integration with Recognize

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Recognize with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Recognize with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Recognize.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Recognize with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Recognize single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* Recognize supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Add Recognize from the gallery

To configure the integration of Recognize into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Recognize from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Recognize** in the search box.
1. Select **Recognize** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Recognize

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Recognize using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Recognize.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Recognize, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Recognize SSO](#configure-recognize-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Recognize test user](#create-recognize-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Recognize that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Create Recognize test user

In order to enable Microsoft Entra users to log into Recognize, they must be provisioned into Recognize. In the case of Recognize, provisioning is a manual task.

This app doesn't support SCIM provisioning but has an alternate user sync that provisions users. 

**To provision a user account, perform the following steps:**

1. Sign into your Recognize company site as an administrator.

2. On the upper right corner, click **Menu**. Go to **Company Admin**.

3. On the left navigation pane, click **Settings**.

4. Perform the following steps on **User Sync** section.
   
	![New User](./media/recognize-tutorial/user.png "New User")
   
	a. As **Sync Enabled**, select **ON**.
   
	b. As **Choose sync provider**, select **Microsoft / Office 365**.
   
	c. Click **Run User Sync**.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Recognize Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Recognize Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Recognize tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Recognize Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure Recognize you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

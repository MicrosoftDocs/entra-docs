# Configure Marker.io for Single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID

In this article,  you learn how to integrate Marker.io with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Marker.io with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Marker.io.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Marker.io with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites
The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

[!INCLUDE [common-prerequisites.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/common-prerequisites.md)]
* Marker.io single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Marker.io supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.
* Marker.io supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add Marker.io from the gallery

To configure the integration of Marker.io into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Marker.io from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Marker.io** in the search box.
1. Select **Marker.io** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Marker.io

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Marker.io using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Marker.io.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Marker.io, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-microsoft-entra-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Marker.io SSO](#configure-markerio-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Marker.io test user](#create-markerio-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Marker.io that's linked to the Microsoft Entra ID representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO in the Microsoft Entra admin center.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **Marker.io** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Screenshot shows how to edit Basic SAML Configuration.](common/edit-urls.png "Basic Configuration")

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type the URL:
    `https://api.marker.io/auth/sso/saml`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://api.marker.io/auth/sso/saml/<ID>`

1. Perform the following step, if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type the URL:
    `https://api.marker.io/auth/sso/saml`

	> [!NOTE]
	> The Reply URL isn't real. Update this value with the actual Reply URL. Contact [Marker.io support team](mailto:info@marker.io) to get the value. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Microsoft Entra admin center.

1. Marker.io application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![Screenshot shows the image of attributes.](common/default-attributes.png "Image")

1. In addition to above, Marker.io application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.
	
	| Name | Source Attribute|
	| ------------ | --------- |
    | firstName | user.givenname |
    | lastName  | user.surname   |
    

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

	![Screenshot shows The Certificate download link.](common/metadataxml.png "Certificate")

1. On the **Set up Marker.io** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

	![Screenshot shows how to copy configuration URLs.](common/copy-configuration-urls.png "Configurations") 

[!INCLUDE [create-assign-users-sso.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/create-assign-users-sso.md)]

## Configure Marker.io SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Marker.io** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from Microsoft Entra admin center to [Marker.io support team](mailto:info@marker.io). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Marker.io test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in Marker.io. Marker.io supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Marker.io, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

#### SP initiated:

* Select **Test this application** in Microsoft Entra admin center. This option redirects to Marker.io Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  
* Go to Marker.io Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Select **Test this application** in Microsoft Entra admin center and you should be automatically signed in to the Marker.io for which you set up the SSO.

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the Marker.io tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign-on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Marker.io for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](

Once you configure Marker.io you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization's sensitive data in real time.

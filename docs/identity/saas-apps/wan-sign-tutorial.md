# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with WAN-Sign

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate WAN-Sign with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate WAN-Sign with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to WAN-Sign.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to WAN-Sign with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* WAN-Sign single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* WAN-Sign supports both **SP** and **IDP** initiated SSO.

## Add WAN-Sign from the gallery

To configure the integration of WAN-Sign into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add WAN-Sign from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **WAN-Sign** in the search box.
1. Select **WAN-Sign** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for WAN-Sign

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with WAN-Sign using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in WAN-Sign.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with WAN-Sign, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure WAN-Sign SSO](#configure-wan-sign-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create WAN-Sign test user](#create-wan-sign-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in WAN-Sign that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **WAN-Sign** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://service10.wanbishi.ne.jp/saml/metadata/azuread/<CustomerID>`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://service10.wanbishi.ne.jp/saml/azuread/<CustomerID>`

1. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in SP initiated mode:

    In the **Sign on URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://service10.wanbishi.ne.jp/saml/login/azuread/<CustomerID>`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Sign on URL. Contact [WAN-Sign Client support team](mailto:wansign-help@wanbishi.ne.jp) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Certificate (Base64)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

### Assign the Microsoft Entra test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use single sign-on by granting access to WAN-Sign.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **WAN-Sign**.
1. In the app's overview page, select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user/group**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
   1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
   1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
   1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure WAN-Sign SSO

To configure single sign-on on **WAN-Sign** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [WAN-Sign support team](mailto:wansign-help@wanbishi.ne.jp). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create WAN-Sign test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in WAN-Sign. Work with [WAN-Sign support team](mailto:wansign-help@wanbishi.ne.jp) to add the users in the WAN-Sign platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to WAN-Sign Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to WAN-Sign Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the WAN-Sign for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the WAN-Sign tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the WAN-Sign for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

## Next steps

Once you configure WAN-Sign you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

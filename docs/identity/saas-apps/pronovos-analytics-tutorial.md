## Configure ProNovos Analytics SSO

To configure single sign-on on **ProNovos Analytics** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Raw)** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [ProNovos Analytics support team](mailto:support@pronovos.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create ProNovos Analytics test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in ProNovos Analytics. ProNovos Analytics supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in ProNovos Analytics, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you select the ProNovos Analytics tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the ProNovos Analytics for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

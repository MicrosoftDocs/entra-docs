# Microsoft Entra SSO integration with SPS|Production Manager

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate SPS|Production Manager with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate SPS|Production Manager with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to SPS|Production Manager.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to SPS|Production Manager with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Microsoft Entra ID with SPS|Production Manager, you need:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* SPS|Production Manager single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

* SPS|Production Manager supports **IDP** initiated SSO.

## Adding SPS|Production Manager from the gallery

To configure the integration of SPS|Production Manager into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add SPS|Production Manager from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).

In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

* Click on Test this application in Microsoft Entra admin center and you should be automatically signed in to the SPS|Production Manager for which you set up the SSO.
 
* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the SPS|Production Manager tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the SPS|Production Manager for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

# Customer intent: As an IT administrator, I want to learn how to configure single sign-on between Microsoft Entra ID and TencentCloud IDaaS so that I can control who has access to TencentCloud IDaaS, enable automatic sign-in with Microsoft Entra accounts, and manage my accounts in one central location.

# Microsoft Entra SSO integration with TencentCloud IDaaS

In this article, you'll learn how to integrate TencentCloud IDaaS with Microsoft Entra ID. Tencent Cloud IDaaS is dedicated to providing enterprises with identity authentication and data management services. When you integrate TencentCloud IDaaS with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to TencentCloud IDaaS.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to TencentCloud IDaaS with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

You'll configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on for TencentCloud IDaaS in a test environment. TencentCloud IDaaS supports both **SP** and **IDP** initiated single sign-on and **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Microsoft Entra ID with TencentCloud IDaaS, you need:

* A Microsoft Entra user account. If you don't already have one, you can [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* One of the following roles: [Application Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#application-administrator), [Cloud Application Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#cloud-application-administrator), or [Application Owner](/entra/fundamentals/users-default-permissions#owned-enterprise-applications).
* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* TencentCloud IDaaS single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Add application and assign a test user

Before you begin the process of configuring single sign-on, you need to add the TencentCloud IDaaS application from the Microsoft Entra gallery. You need a test user account to assign to the application and test the single sign-on configuration.

### Add TencentCloud IDaaS from the Microsoft Entra gallery

Add TencentCloud IDaaS from the Microsoft Entra application gallery to configure single sign-on with TencentCloud IDaaS. For more information on how to add application from the gallery, see the [Quickstart: Add application from the gallery](~/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal.md).

### Create and assign Microsoft Entra test user

Follow the guidelines in the [create and assign a user account](~/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal-assign-users.md) article to create a test user account called B.Simon.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, and assign roles. The wizard also provides a link to the single sign-on configuration pane.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Complete the following steps to enable Microsoft Entra single sign-on.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **TencentCloud IDaaS** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Screenshot shows how to edit Basic SAML Configuration.](common/edit-urls.png "Basic Configuration")

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** textbox, type a value using the following pattern:
    `yufuid.com/<appInstanceId>`

    b. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<tenantUrl>/cidp/saml2/<appInstanceId>`

1. If you want to configure **SP** initiated SSO, then perform the following step:  

    In the **Sign on URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<tenantUrl>/sso/<tenantId>/<appInstanceId>`

    > [!Note]
    > These values are not the real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Sign on URL. Contact [TencentCloud IDaaS Client support team](mailto:empdept@tencent.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click copy button to copy **App Federation Metadata Url** and save it on your computer.

## Configure TencentCloud IDaaS SSO

To configure single sign-on on **TencentCloud IDaaS SSO** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [TencentCloud IDaaS SSO support team](mailto:empdept@tencent.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create TencentCloud IDaaS test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in TencentCloud IDaaS. TencentCloud IDaaS supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in TencentCloud IDaaS, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to TencentCloud IDaaS Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to TencentCloud IDaaS Sign on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the TencentCloud IDaaS for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the TencentCloud IDaaS tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign-on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the TencentCloud IDaaS for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

## Next steps

Once you configure TencentCloud IDaaS you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

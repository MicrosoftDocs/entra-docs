The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

[!INCLUDE [common-prerequisites.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/common-prerequisites.md)]
* OpenLearning single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> This integration is also available to use from Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud environment. You can find this application in the Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud Application Gallery and configure it in the same way as you do from public cloud.

## Scenario description

In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* OpenLearning supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Add OpenLearning from the gallery

To configure the integration of OpenLearning into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add OpenLearning from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for OpenLearning

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with OpenLearning using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in OpenLearning.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with OpenLearning, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure OpenLearning SSO](#configure-openlearning-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create OpenLearning test user](#create-openlearning-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in OpenLearning that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Create OpenLearning test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in OpenLearning. OpenLearning supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in OpenLearning, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to OpenLearning Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to OpenLearning Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the OpenLearning tile in the My Apps, this option redirects to OpenLearning Sign-on URL. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

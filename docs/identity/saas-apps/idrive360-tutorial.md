# Customer intent: As an IT administrator, I want to learn how to configure single sign-on between Microsoft Entra ID and IDrive360 so that I can control who has access to IDrive360, enable automatic sign-in with Microsoft Entra accounts, and manage my accounts in one central location.

# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with IDrive360

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate IDrive360 with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate IDrive360 with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to IDrive360.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to IDrive360 with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* IDrive360 single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* IDrive360 supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add IDrive360 from the gallery

To configure the integration of IDrive360 into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add IDrive360 from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **IDrive360** in the search box.
1. Select **IDrive360** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for IDrive360

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with IDrive360 using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in IDrive360.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with IDrive360, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure IDrive360 SSO](#configure-idrive360-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create IDrive360 test user](#create-idrive360-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in IDrive360 that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

2. Navigate to the **Users** tab and click **Add User**.

    ![Users](./media/idrive360-tutorial/add-user.png "Users")

    a. Enter valid **Email Address** in the **Email** textbox.

    b. Click **Create**.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to IDrive360 Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to IDrive360 Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the IDrive360 for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the IDrive360 tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the IDrive360 for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure IDrive360 you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra integration with ArcGIS Online

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate ArcGIS Online with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate ArcGIS Online with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to ArcGIS Online.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to ArcGIS Online with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* ArcGIS Online single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> This integration is also available to use from Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud environment. You can find this application in the Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud Application Gallery and configure it in the same way as you do from public cloud.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* ArcGIS Online supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Add ArcGIS Online from the gallery

To configure the integration of ArcGIS Online into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add ArcGIS Online from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **ArcGIS Online** in the search box.
1. Select **ArcGIS Online** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for ArcGIS Online

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with ArcGIS Online using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in ArcGIS Online.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with ArcGIS Online, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure ArcGIS Online SSO](#configure-arcgis-online-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create ArcGIS Online test user](#create-arcgis-online-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in ArcGIS Online that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to ArcGIS Online Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to ArcGIS Online Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the ArcGIS Online tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to ArcGIS Online Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure ArcGIS Online you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

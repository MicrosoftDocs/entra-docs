## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for ArcGIS Online

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with ArcGIS Online using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in ArcGIS Online.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with ArcGIS Online, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure ArcGIS Online SSO](#configure-arcgis-online-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create ArcGIS Online test user](#create-arcgis-online-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in ArcGIS Online that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

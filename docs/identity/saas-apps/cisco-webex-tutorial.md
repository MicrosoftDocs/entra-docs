# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with Cisco Webex Meetings

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Cisco Webex Meetings with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Cisco Webex Meetings with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Cisco Webex Meetings.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Cisco Webex Meetings with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Cisco Webex Meetings single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.
*  Service Provider Metadata file from Cisco Webex Meetings.
* Along with Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator can also add or manage applications in Microsoft Entra ID.
For more information, see [Azure built-in roles](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md).

> [!NOTE]
> This integration is also available to use from Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud environment. You can find this application in the Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud Application Gallery and configure it in the same way as you do from public cloud.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Cisco Webex Meetings supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.
* Cisco Webex Meetings supports [**Automated** user provisioning and deprovisioning](cisco-webex-provisioning-tutorial.md) (recommended).
* Cisco Webex Meetings supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Add Cisco Webex Meetings from the gallery

To configure the integration of Cisco Webex Meetings into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Cisco Webex Meetings from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Cisco Webex Meetings** in the search box.
1. Select **Cisco Webex Meetings** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Cisco Webex Meetings

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Cisco Webex Meetings using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Cisco Webex Meetings.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Cisco Webex Meetings, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
   1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
   1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Cisco Webex Meetings SSO](#configure-cisco-webex-meetings-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
   1. **[Create Cisco Webex Meetings test user](#create-cisco-webex-meetings-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Cisco Webex Meetings that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.   
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

   1. Click **Save**.

      > [!NOTE]
      > This configuration is only for the customers that use Webex UserID in email format.
      > 
      > To learn more about how to configure the Cisco Webex meetings, see the [Webex documentation](https://help.webex.com/WBX000022701/How-Do-I-Configure-Microsoft-Azure-Active-Directory-Integration-with-Cisco-Webex-Through-Site-Administration#:~:text=In%20the%20Azure%20portal%2C%20select,in%20the%20Add%20Assignment%20dialog) page.

### Create Cisco Webex Meetings test user

The objective of this section is to create a user called B.Simon in Cisco Webex Meetings. Cisco Webex Meetings supports **just-in-time** provisioning, which is by default enabled. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Cisco Webex Meetings, a new one is created when you attempt to access Cisco Webex Meetings.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Cisco Webex Meetings Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Cisco Webex Meetings Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Cisco Webex Meetings for which you set up the SSO.

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the Cisco Webex Meetings tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Cisco Webex Meetings for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure Cisco Webex Meetings you can enforce Session Control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session Control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

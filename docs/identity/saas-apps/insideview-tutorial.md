# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra integration with InsideView

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate InsideView with Microsoft Entra ID.
This integration provides these benefits:

* You can use Microsoft Entra ID to control who has access to InsideView.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed in to InsideView (single sign-on) with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location: the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Microsoft Entra ID, see [Single sign-on to applications in Microsoft Entra ID](~/identity/enterprise-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Microsoft Entra integration with InsideView, you need to have:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a Microsoft Entra environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* An InsideView subscription that has single sign-on enabled.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you'll configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* InsideView supports IdP-initiated SSO.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on

In this section, you'll configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with InsideView by using a test user named Britta Simon.
To enable single sign-on, you need to establish a relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the corresponding user in InsideView.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with InsideView, you need to complete these steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra single sign-on](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** to enable the feature for your users.
2. **[Configure InsideView single sign-on](#configure-insideview-single-sign-on)** on the application side.
3. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
4. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** to enable Microsoft Entra single sign-on for the user.
5. **[Create an InsideView test user](#create-an-insideview-test-user)** that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of the user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** to verify that the configuration works.

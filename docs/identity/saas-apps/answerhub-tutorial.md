# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with AnswerHub

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate AnswerHub with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate AnswerHub with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to AnswerHub.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to AnswerHub with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* AnswerHub single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* AnswerHub supports SP-initiated SSO.

## Add AnswerHub from the gallery

To configure the integration of AnswerHub into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add AnswerHub from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **AnswerHub** in the search box.
1. Select **AnswerHub** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure AnswerHub SSO](#configure-answerhub-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create AnswerHub test user](#create-answerhub-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in AnswerHub that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

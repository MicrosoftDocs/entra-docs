## Configure MindTickle SSO

They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create MindTickle test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in MindTickle. MindTickle supports **just-in-time user provisioning**, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in MindTickle, a new one is created after authentication.

MindTickle also supports automatic user provisioning, you can find more details [here](./mindtickle-provisioning-tutorial.md) on how to configure automatic user provisioning.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to MindTickle Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to MindTickle Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the MindTickle tile in the My Apps, this option redirects to MindTickle Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Moveworks.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Moveworks with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites
The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

[!INCLUDE [common-prerequisites.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/common-prerequisites.md)]
* Moveworks single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Moveworks supports both **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.
* Moveworks supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add Moveworks from the gallery

To configure the integration of Moveworks into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Moveworks from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Moveworks** in the search box.

In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

### Create Moveworks test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in Moveworks. Moveworks supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Moveworks, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.
 
#### SP initiated:
 
* Select **Test this application** in Microsoft Entra admin center. this option redirects to Moveworks Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  
 
* Go to Moveworks Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.
 
#### IDP initiated:
 
* Select **Test this application** in Microsoft Entra admin center and you should be automatically signed in to the Moveworks for which you set up the SSO.
 
You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the Moveworks tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign-on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Moveworks for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) integration with Cisco AnyConnect

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Cisco AnyConnect with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Cisco AnyConnect with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Cisco AnyConnect.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Cisco AnyConnect with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Cisco AnyConnect single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Cisco AnyConnect supports **IDP** initiated SSO.

## Adding Cisco AnyConnect from the gallery

To configure the integration of Cisco AnyConnect into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Cisco AnyConnect from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Cisco AnyConnect** in the search box.
1. Select **Cisco AnyConnect** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Cisco AnyConnect

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Cisco AnyConnect using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Cisco AnyConnect.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Cisco AnyConnect, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Cisco AnyConnect SSO](#configure-cisco-anyconnect-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Cisco AnyConnect test user](#create-cisco-anyconnect-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Cisco AnyConnect that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **Cisco AnyConnect** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, enter the values for the following fields:

   1. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:  
      `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.YourCiscoServer.com/saml/sp/metadata/<Tunnel_Group_Name>`

   1. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:  
      `https://<YOUR_CISCO_ANYCONNECT_FQDN>/+CSCOE+/saml/sp/acs?tgname=<Tunnel_Group_Name>`

    > [!NOTE]
    > `<Tunnel_Group_Name>` is a case-sensitive and the value must not contain dots "." and slashes "/".

    > [!NOTE]
    > For clarification about these values, contact Cisco TAC support. Update these values with the actual Identifier and Reply URL provided by Cisco TAC. Contact the [Cisco AnyConnect Client support team](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Certificate (Base64)** and select **Download** to download the certificate file and save it on your computer.

1. On the **Set up Cisco AnyConnect** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

	![Copy configuration URLs](common/copy-configuration-urls.png)

> [!NOTE]
> If you would like to on board multiple TGTs of the server then you need to add multiple instances of the Cisco AnyConnect application from the gallery. You can also choose to upload your own certificate in Microsoft Entra ID for all these application instances. That way you can have same certificate for the applications but you can configure different Identifier and Reply URL for every application.

### Assign the Microsoft Entra test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use single sign-on by granting access to Cisco AnyConnect.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **Cisco AnyConnect**.
1. In the app's overview page, select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user/group**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
   1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
   1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
   1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Cisco AnyConnect SSO

1. You are going to do this on the CLI first, you might come back through and do an ASDM walk-through at another time.

1. Connect to your VPN Appliance, you are going to be using an ASA running 9.8 code train, and your VPN clients will be 4.6+.

1. First you will create a Trustpoint and import our SAML cert.

   ```
    config t

    crypto ca trustpoint AzureAD-AC-SAML
      revocation-check none
      no id-usage
      enrollment terminal
      no ca-check
    crypto ca authenticate AzureAD-AC-SAML
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    …
    PEM Certificate Text from download goes here
    …
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    quit
   ```

1. The following commands will provision your SAML IdP.

   ```
    webvpn
    saml idp https://sts.windows.net/xxxxxxxxxxxxx/ (This is your Azure AD Identifier from the Set up Cisco AnyConnect section in the Azure portal)
    url sign-in https://login.microsoftonline.com/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/saml2 (This is your Login URL from the Set up Cisco AnyConnect section in the Azure portal)
    url sign-out https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/wsfederation?wa=wsignout1.0 (This is Logout URL from the Set up Cisco AnyConnect section in the Azure portal)
    trustpoint idp AzureAD-AC-SAML
    trustpoint sp (Trustpoint for SAML Requests - you can use your existing external cert here)
    no force re-authentication
    no signature
    base-url https://my.asa.com
    ```

1. Now you can apply SAML Authentication to a VPN Tunnel Configuration.

    ```
    tunnel-group AC-SAML webvpn-attributes
      saml identity-provider https://sts.windows.net/xxxxxxxxxxxxx/
      authentication saml
    end

    write mem
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > There is a work around with the SAML IdP configuration. If you make changes to the IdP configuration you need to remove the saml identity-provider configuration from your Tunnel Group and re-apply it for the changes to become effective.

### Create Cisco AnyConnect test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Cisco AnyConnect. Work with [Cisco AnyConnect support team](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html) to add the users in the Cisco AnyConnect platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Cisco AnyConnect for which you set up the SSO
* You can use Microsoft Access Panel. When you click the Cisco AnyConnect tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the Cisco AnyConnect for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure Cisco AnyConnect you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

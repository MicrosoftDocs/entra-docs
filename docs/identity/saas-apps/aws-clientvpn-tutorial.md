## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for AWS ClientVPN

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with AWS ClientVPN using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in AWS ClientVPN.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with AWS ClientVPN, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure AWS ClientVPN SSO](#configure-aws-clientvpn-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create AWS ClientVPN test user](#create-aws-clientvpn-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in AWS ClientVPN that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

	a. In the **Sign on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<LOCALHOST>`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using one of the following patterns:

    | Reply URL |
    |------------|
    | `http://<LOCALHOST>` |
    | `https://self-service.clientvpn.amazonaws.com/api/auth/sso/saml` |
    |

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values aren't real.  Update these values with the actual Sign on URL and Reply URL.  The Sign on URL and Reply URL can have the same value (`http://127.0.0.1:35001`). Refer to [AWS Client VPN Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/clientvpn-admin/client-authentication.html#ad) for details.   You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section. Contact [AWS ClientVPN support team](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/) for any configuration issues. 

1. AWS ClientVPN application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	| Name |  Source Attribute|
	| -------------- | --------- |
	| memberOf | user.groups |
    | FirstName | user.givenname |
    | LastName | user.surname |

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

## Configure AWS ClientVPN SSO

Follow the instructions given in the [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/clientvpn-admin/client-authentication.html#federated-authentication) to configure single sign-on on AWS ClientVPN side.

### Create AWS ClientVPN test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in AWS ClientVPN. AWS ClientVPN supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in AWS ClientVPN, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to AWS ClientVPN Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to AWS ClientVPN Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the AWS ClientVPN tile in the My Apps, this option redirects to AWS ClientVPN Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) integration with Pulse Secure Virtual Traffic Manager

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Pulse Secure Virtual Traffic Manager with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Pulse Secure Virtual Traffic Manager with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Pulse Secure Virtual Traffic Manager.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Pulse Secure Virtual Traffic Manager with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Pulse Secure Virtual Traffic Manager single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Pulse Secure Virtual Traffic Manager supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Add Pulse Secure Virtual Traffic Manager from the gallery

To configure the integration of Pulse Secure Virtual Traffic Manager into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Pulse Secure Virtual Traffic Manager from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Pulse Secure Virtual Traffic Manager** in the search box.
1. Select **Pulse Secure Virtual Traffic Manager** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Pulse Secure Virtual Traffic Manager

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Pulse Secure Virtual Traffic Manager using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Pulse Secure Virtual Traffic Manager.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Pulse Secure Virtual Traffic Manager, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Pulse Secure Virtual Traffic Manager SSO](#configure-pulse-secure-virtual-traffic-manager-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Pulse Secure Virtual Traffic Manager test user](#create-pulse-secure-virtual-traffic-manager-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Pulse Secure Virtual Traffic Manager that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Pulse Secure Virtual Traffic Manager Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Pulse Secure Virtual Traffic Manager Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Pulse Secure Virtual Traffic Manager tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Pulse Secure Virtual Traffic Manager Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure Pulse Secure Virtual Traffic Manager you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) integration with Palo Alto Networks Cloud Identity Engine - Cloud Authentication Service

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Palo Alto Networks Cloud Identity Engine - Cloud Authentication Service with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Palo Alto Networks Cloud Identity Engine - Cloud Authentication Service with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Palo Alto Networks Cloud Identity Engine - Cloud Authentication Service.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Palo Alto Networks Cloud Identity Engine - Cloud Authentication Service with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Palo Alto Networks Cloud Identity Engine - Cloud Authentication Service single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Palo Alto Networks Cloud Identity Engine - Cloud Authentication Service supports **SP** initiated SSO.

* Palo Alto Networks Cloud Identity Engine - Cloud Authentication Service supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Add Palo Alto Networks Cloud Identity Engine - Cloud Authentication Service from the gallery

To configure the integration of Palo Alto Networks Cloud Identity Engine - Cloud Authentication Service into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Palo Alto Networks Cloud Identity Engine - Cloud Authentication Service from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).

	> [!Note]
	> If the **Identifier** value does not get auto populated, then please fill in the value manually according to your requirement. The Sign-on URL value is not real. Update this value with the actual Sign-on URL. Contact [Palo Alto Networks Cloud Identity Engine - Cloud Authentication Service Client support team](mailto:support@paloaltonetworks.com) to get this value. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section.

1. Palo Alto Networks Cloud Identity Engine - Cloud Authentication Service application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![image](common/default-attributes.png)

1. In addition to above, Palo Alto Networks Cloud Identity Engine - Cloud Authentication Service application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.
	
	| Name | Source Attribute|
	| ---------------| --------- |
	| Group |  user.groups |
	| username | user.userprincipalname |

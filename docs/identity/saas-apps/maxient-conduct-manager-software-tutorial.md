## Add Maxient Conduct Manager Software from the gallery

To configure the integration of Maxient Conduct Manager Software into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Maxient Conduct Manager Software from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Maxient Conduct Manager Software** in the search box.
1. Select **Maxient Conduct Manager Software** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **Maxient Conduct Manager Software** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section the application is pre-configured in **IDP** initiated mode and the necessary URLs are already pre-populated with Azure. The user needs to save the configuration by clicking the **Save** button.

1. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://cm.maxient.com/<SCHOOLCODE>`

    > [!NOTE]
    > The value is not real. Update the value with the actual Sign-on URL. Work with your Maxient Implementation/Support representative to get the value.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, In the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click copy button to copy **App Federation Metadata Url** and save it on your computer.  You will need to provide your Maxient Implementation/Support representative with this URL.

### Set "User Assignment Required?" to No

It is important to note that this step is **REQUIRED** for Maxient to function properly.  Maxient leverages your Microsoft Entra system to *authenticate* users. The *authorization* of users is performed within the Maxient system for the particular function they’re trying to perform. Maxient does not use attributes from your directory to make those decisions.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **Maxient Conduct Manager Software**.
1. In the app's overview page, toggle the "User Assignment Required" setting to No.

## Test with Maxient 

If a support ticket has not already been opened with a Maxient Implementation/Support representative, send an email to [support@maxient.com](mailto:support@maxient.com) with the subject "Campus Based Authentication/Azure Setup - \<\<School Name\>\>". In the body of the email, provide the **App Federation Metadata Url**. Maxient staff will respond with a test link to verify the proper attributes are being released.  
	
## Next steps

Once you configure Maxient Conduct Manager Software you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

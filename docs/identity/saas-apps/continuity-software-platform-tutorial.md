# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) integration with Continuity Software Platform

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Continuity Software Platform with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Continuity Software Platform with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

Use Microsoft Entra ID to control who can access Continuity Software Platform.
Enable your users to be automatically signed in to Continuity Software Platform with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
Manage your accounts in one central location: the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Continuity Software Platform single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

1. Browse to **Identity > Applications > Enterprise applications > New application**.

1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, enter **Continuity Software Platform** in the search box.

1. Select **Continuity Software Platform** in the results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

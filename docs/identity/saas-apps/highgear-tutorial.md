If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a Microsoft Entra environment, you can get a one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/)
* A HighGear system with an Enterprise or Unlimited license

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you can learn how to configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on

In this section, you can learn how to configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with your HighGear system based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in your HighGear system needs to be established.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with your HighGear system, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure HighGear Single Sign-On](#configure-highgear-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on the HighGear application side.
3. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
5. **[Create HighGear test user](#create-highgear-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in HighGear that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of the user. 
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

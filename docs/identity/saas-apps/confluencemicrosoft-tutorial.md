# Configure Confluence SAML SSO by Microsoft for Single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID

In this article,  you learn how to integrate Confluence SAML SSO by Microsoft with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Confluence SAML SSO by Microsoft with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Confluence SAML SSO by Microsoft.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Confluence SAML SSO by Microsoft with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.


## Description:

Use your Microsoft Entra account with Atlassian Confluence server to enable single sign-on. This way all your organization users can use the Microsoft Entra credentials to sign in into the Confluence application. This plugin uses SAML 2.0 for federation.

## Prerequisites

The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

[!INCLUDE [common-prerequisites.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/common-prerequisites.md)]
- Confluence server application installed on a Windows 64-bit server (on-premises or on the cloud IaaS infrastructure).
- Confluence server is HTTPS enabled.
- Note the supported versions for Confluence Plugin are mentioned in below section.
- Confluence server is reachable on internet particularly to Microsoft Entra Login page for authentication and should able to receive the token from Microsoft Entra ID.
- Admin credentials are set up in Confluence.
- WebSudo is disabled in Confluence.
- Test user created in the Confluence server application.

> [!NOTE]
> To test the steps in this article,  we don't recommend using a production environment of Confluence. Test the integration first in development or staging environment of the application and then use the production environment.

> [!NOTE]
> This integration is also available to use from Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud environment. You can find this application in the Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud Application Gallery and configure it in the same way as you do from public cloud.

To get started, you need the following items:

* don't use your production environment, unless it's necessary.

    ![Screenshot that shows the "Cog" icon selected, and "Add-ons" highlighted in the drop-down menu.](./media/confluencemicrosoft-tutorial/add-on-1.png)

1. Download the plugin from [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=56503). Manually upload the plugin provided by Microsoft using **Upload add-on** menu. The download of plugin is covered under [Microsoft Service Agreement](https://www.microsoft.com/servicesagreement/).

    ![Screenshot that shows the "Manage add-ons" page with the "Upload add-on" action selected.](./media/confluencemicrosoft-tutorial/add-on-12.png)

1. For running the Confluence reverse proxy scenario or load balancer scenario perform the following steps:

    > [!NOTE]
    > You should be configuring the server first with the below instructions and then install the plugin.

    a. Add below attribute in **connector** port in **server.xml** file of JIRA server application.

    `scheme="https" proxyName="<subdomain.domain.com>" proxyPort="<proxy_port>" secure="true"`

    ![Screenshot that shows the "server.xml" file with the attribute added to the "connector" port.](./media/confluencemicrosoft-tutorial/reverse-proxy-1.png)

    b. Change **Base URL** in **System Settings** according to proxy/load balancer.

    ![Screenshot that shows the "Administration - Settings" page with "Base URL" highlighted.](./media/confluencemicrosoft-tutorial/reverse-proxy-2.png)

1. Once the plugin is installed, it appears in **User Installed** add-ons section of **Manage Add-on** section. Select **Configure** to configure the new plugin.

1. Perform following steps on configuration page:

    > [!TIP]
    > Ensure that there is only one certificate mapped against the app so that there is no error in resolving the metadata. If there are multiple certificates, admin gets an error upon resolving the metadata.

    ![Screenshot that shows the single sign-on configuration page.](./media/confluencemicrosoft-tutorial/sso-plugin-configuration-page.png)

    1. In the **Metadata URL** textbox, paste **App Federation Metadata Url** value which you have copied and select the **Resolve** button. It reads the IdP metadata URL and populates all the fields information.

    1. Copy the **Identifier, Reply URL and Sign on URL** values and paste them in **Identifier, Reply URL and Sign on URL** textboxes respectively in **Basic SAML Configuration** section.

    1. In **Login Button Name** type the name of button your organization wants the users to see on login screen.

    1. In **Login Button Description** type the description of button your organization wants the users to see on login screen.
  
    1. In **Default Group** Select your organization Default Group to assign to new users (Default groups facilitate organized access rights to new user account).
  
    1. In **Auto-create User** feature (JIT User Provisioning): It automates user account creation in authorized web applications, without the need for manual provisioning. This reduces administrative workload and increases productivity. Because JIT relies on the login response from Azure AD, enter the SAML-response attribute values, which include the user's email address, last name, and first name.

    1. In **SAML User ID Locations**, select either **User ID is in the NameIdentifier element of the Subject statement** or **User ID is in an Attribute element**.  This ID has to be the Confluence user ID. If the user ID isn't matched, then system doesn't allow users to sign in. 

       > [!Note]
       > Default SAML User ID location is Name Identifier. You can change this to an attribute option and enter the appropriate attribute name.

    1. If you select **User ID is in an Attribute element** option, then in **Attribute name** textbox type the name of the attribute where User ID is expected. 

    1. If you're using the federated domain (like ADFS, and so on) with Microsoft Entra ID, then select the **Enable Home Realm Discovery** option and configure the **Domain Name**.

    1. In **Domain Name** type the domain name here in case of the ADFS-based login.

    1. Check **Enable Single Sign out** if you wish to sign out from Microsoft Entra ID when a user signs out from Confluence. 

    1. Enable **Force Azure Login** checkbox, if you wish to sign in through Microsoft Entra credentials only.

       > [!Note]
       > To enable the default login form for admin login on the login page when the force azure login is enabled, add the query parameter in the browser URL.
       > `https://<DOMAIN:PORT>/login.action?force_azure_login=false`

    1. **Enable Use of Application Proxy** checkbox, if you have configured your on-premise atlassian application in an application proxy setup. For App proxy setup , follow the steps on the [Microsoft Entra application proxy Documentation](~/identity/app-proxy/overview-what-is-app-proxy.md).

    1. Select **Save** button to save the settings.

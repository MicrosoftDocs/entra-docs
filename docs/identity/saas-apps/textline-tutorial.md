# Configure Textline for Single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID

In this article,  you learn how to integrate Textline with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Textline with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Textline.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Textline with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

[!INCLUDE [common-prerequisites.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/common-prerequisites.md)]
* Textline single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Textline supports **IDP** initiated SSO.

* Textline supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Add Textline from the gallery

To configure the integration of Textline into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Textline from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Textline** in the search box.
1. Select **Textline** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Textline

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Textline using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Textline.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Textline, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
   1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
   1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Textline SSO](#configure-textline-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
   1. **[Create Textline test user](#create-textline-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Textline linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Textline SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Textline** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [Textline support team](mailto:security@textline.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Textline test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in Textline. Textline supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Textline, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Textline for which you set up the SSO.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the Textline tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the Textline for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

Once you configure Textline you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

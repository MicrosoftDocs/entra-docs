# Microsoft Entra SSO integration with HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP)

In this article, you learn how to integrate HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) with Microsoft Entra ID. HashiCorp Cloud Platform hosting managed services of the developer tools created by HashiCorp, such Terraform, Vault, Boundary, and Consul. When you integrate HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP).
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

You configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on for HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) in a test environment. HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) supports only **SP** initiated single sign-on.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Microsoft Entra ID with HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP), you need:

* A Microsoft Entra user account. If you don't already have one, you can [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* One of the following roles: Global Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator, or owner of the service principal.
* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) single sign-on (SSO) enabled organization.

## Add application and assign a test user

Before you begin the process of configuring single sign-on, you need to add the HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) application from the Microsoft Entra gallery. You need a test user account to assign to the application and test the single sign-on configuration.

## Configure HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) SSO

To configure single sign-on on the **HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP)** side, you need to add a verification record TXT to your domain host, add the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and **Login URL** copied from Azure portal to your HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) Organization "Setup SAML SSO" page.

## Test SSO 

In the previous [Create and assign Microsoft Entra test user](#create-and-assign-azure-ad-test-user) section, you created a user called B.Simon and assigned it to the HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) app within the Azure portal. This can now be used for testing the SSO connection. You may also use any account that is already associated with the HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) app.

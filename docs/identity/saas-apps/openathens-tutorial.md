1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    * **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    * **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure OpenAthens SSO](#configure-openathens-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    * **[Create OpenAthens test user](#create-openathens-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in OpenAthens that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Create OpenAthens test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in OpenAthens. OpenAthens supports **just-in-time user provisioning**, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in OpenAthens, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the OpenAthens for which you set up the SSO.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the OpenAthens tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the OpenAthens for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

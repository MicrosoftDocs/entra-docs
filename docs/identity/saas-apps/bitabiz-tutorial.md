# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra integration with BitaBIZ

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate BitaBIZ with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate BitaBIZ with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to BitaBIZ.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to BitaBIZ with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To configure Microsoft Entra integration with BitaBIZ, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a Microsoft Entra environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* BitaBIZ single sign-on enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* BitaBIZ supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.
* BitaBIZ supports [Automated user provisioning](bitabiz-provisioning-tutorial.md).


## Add BitaBIZ from the gallery

To configure the integration of BitaBIZ into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add BitaBIZ from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **BitaBIZ** in the search box.
1. Select **BitaBIZ** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for BitaBIZ

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with BitaBIZ using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in BitaBIZ.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with BitaBIZ, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with Britta Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
2. **[Configure BitaBIZ SSO](#configure-bitabiz-sso)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
    1. **[Create BitaBIZ test user](#create-bitabiz-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in BitaBIZ that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

>BitaBIZ also supports automatic user provisioning, you can find more details [here](./bitabiz-provisioning-tutorial.md) on how to configure automatic user provisioning.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to BitaBIZ Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to BitaBIZ Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the BitaBIZ for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the BitaBIZ tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the BitaBIZ for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

## Next steps

Once you configure BitaBIZ you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

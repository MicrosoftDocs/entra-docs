1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with Britta Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable Britta Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
2. **[Configure BitaBIZ SSO](#configure-bitabiz-sso)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
    1. **[Create BitaBIZ test user](#create-bitabiz-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in BitaBIZ that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to BitaBIZ Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to BitaBIZ Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the BitaBIZ for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the BitaBIZ tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the BitaBIZ for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

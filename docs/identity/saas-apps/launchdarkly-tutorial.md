# Configure LaunchDarkly for Single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID

In this article,  you learn how to integrate LaunchDarkly with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate LaunchDarkly with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to LaunchDarkly.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to LaunchDarkly with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

	> [!NOTE]
	> The LaunchDarkly Microsoft Entra integration is one-way. After you configure the integration, you can use Microsoft Entra ID to manage users, SSO, and accounts in LaunchDarkly, but you **can't** use LaunchDarkly to manage users, SSO, and accounts in Azure.

## Prerequisites
The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

[!INCLUDE [common-prerequisites.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/common-prerequisites.md)]
* LaunchDarkly single sign-on enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* LaunchDarkly supports **IDP** initiated SSO.
* LaunchDarkly supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add LaunchDarkly from the gallery

To configure the integration of LaunchDarkly into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add LaunchDarkly from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **LaunchDarkly** in the search box.
1. Select **LaunchDarkly** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

# Configure Simple In/Out for automatic user provisioning with Microsoft Entra ID

This article describes the steps you need to perform in both Simple In/Out and Microsoft Entra ID to configure automatic user provisioning. When configured, Microsoft Entra ID automatically provisions and deprovisions users to [Simple In/Out](https://www.simpleinout.com) using the Microsoft Entra provisioning service. For important details on what this service does, how it works, and frequently asked questions, see [Automate user provisioning and deprovisioning to SaaS applications with Microsoft Entra ID](~/identity/app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md).


## Supported capabilities
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create users in Simple In/Out.
> * Remove users in Simple In/Out when they don't require access anymore.
> * Keep user attributes synchronized between Microsoft Entra ID and Simple In/Out.
> * [Single sign-on](~/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal-setup-oidc-sso.md) to Simple In/Out (recommended).

## Prerequisites

The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

* [A Microsoft Entra tenant](~/identity-platform/quickstart-create-new-tenant.md)
* One of the following roles: [Application Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#application-administrator), [Cloud Application Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#cloud-application-administrator), or [Application Owner](/entra/fundamentals/users-default-permissions#owned-enterprise-applications).
* A user account in Simple In/Out with Admin permissions.

## Step 1: Plan your provisioning deployment

* Learn about [how the provisioning service works](~/identity/app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md).
* Determine who's in [scope for provisioning](~/identity/app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).
* Determine what data to [map between Microsoft Entra ID and Simple In/Out](~/identity/app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes.md).

## Step 2: Configure Simple In/Out to support provisioning with Microsoft Entra ID

Any one of your Simple In/Out administrator-level users can configure Single Sign On.

1. In a web browser, head to [simpleinout.com](https://www.simpleinout.com) and sign in with a Simple In/Out administrator's credentials.
1. Select **Settings** in the upper-right.
1. Select **Single Sign On** under the **ENTERPRISE** menu on the left.
1. If you aren't yet on an Enterprise level plan, this settings page will alert you that you need to upgrade your plan in order to use Single Sign On. Follow the link to upgrade your plan if necessary and return to this page.
1. Be sure your provider is set to **Microsoft** and select the **Connect Single Sign On** button.
1. You be asked to confirm that you wish to enable Single Sign On. Select **OK** to confirm.
1. Select **Reveal** on your Recovery Key and store this entire key in a safe place. **IMPORTANT!** If you're ever locked out of your Microsoft accounts and need to disconnect SSO without access, you be required to relay the Recovery Key to Simple In/Out technical support.
1. Select **Reveal** on your Bearer Token and make note of it. You'll need this for Step 5.6.

* When a new user is provisioned from Microsoft Entra ID to Simple In/Out, Simple In/Out will set that user's role to the default role for your organization. This role will govern the user's permissions inside Simple In/Out. For existing users that may be converted to SSO, Simple In/Out will maintain their existing role.

* After users are provisioned to Simple In/Out, any administrator-level user can edit a user's role. This is done by selecting a user on the Simple In/Out board, then selecting the **Edit User** button that appears in the user's profile dialog.

* You can change the default role in Simple In/Out and customize the permissions in the role on Simple In/Out's website.

1. Within Simple In/Out's website, select **Settings** in the upper-right
1. Select **Roles** under the **USERS** menu on the left.
1. Select the **Edit** button associated with your default role as designated by the green checkmark.
1. Any settings can be changed from here and will immediately take effect.

## Step 3: Add Simple In/Out from the Microsoft Entra application gallery

Add Simple In/Out from the Microsoft Entra application gallery to start managing provisioning to Simple In/Out. If you have previously setup Simple In/Out for SSO, you can use the same application. However it's recommended that you create a separate app when testing out the integration initially. Learn more about adding an application from the gallery [here](~/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal.md).

## Step 4: Define who is in scope for provisioning

### To configure automatic user provisioning for Simple In/Out in Microsoft Entra ID:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps**

1. Select the **Provisioning** tab.

	![Screenshot of Provisioning tab.](common/provisioning.png)

1. Set the **Provisioning Mode** to **Automatic**.

	![Screenshot of Provisioning tab automatic.](common/provisioning-automatic.png)

1. Under the **Admin Credentials** section, input your Simple In/Out Tenant URL and Secret Token. Select **Test Connection** to ensure Microsoft Entra ID can connect to Simple In/Out. If the connection fails, ensure your Simple In/Out account has Admin permissions and try again.

 	![Screenshot of Token.](common/provisioning-testconnection-tenanturltoken.png)

1. In the **Notification Email** field, enter the email address of a person who should receive the provisioning error notifications and select the **Send an email notification when a failure occurs** check box.

	![Screenshot of Notification Email.](common/provisioning-notification-email.png)

1. Select **Save**.

1. Under the **Mappings** section, select **Synchronize Microsoft Entra users to Simple In/Out**.

1. Review the user attributes that are synchronized from Microsoft Entra ID to Simple In/Out in the **Attribute-Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the user accounts in Simple In/Out for update operations. If you choose to change the [matching target attribute](~/identity/app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes.md), you need to ensure that the Simple In/Out API supports filtering users based on that attribute. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.

   |Attribute|Type|Supported for filtering|Required by Simple In/Out|
   |---|---|---|---|
   |userName|String|&check;|&check;
   |active|Boolean||
   |displayName|String|&check;|&check;
   |title|String||
   |phoneNumbers[type eq "work"].value|String||
   |phoneNumbers[type eq "mobile"].value|String||
   |phoneNumbers[type eq "fax"].value|String||
   |externalId|String||&check;

1. Under the **Mappings** section, select **Synchronize Microsoft Entra groups to Simple In/Out**.

1. Review the group attributes that are synchronized from Microsoft Entra ID to Simple In/Out in the **Attribute-Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the groups in Simple In/Out for update operations. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.

   |Attribute|Type|Supported for filtering|Required by Simple In/Out|
   |---|---|---|---|
   |displayName|String|&check;|&check;
   |members|Reference||

1. To configure scoping filters, refer to the following instructions provided in the [Scoping filter  article](~/identity/app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).

1. To enable the Microsoft Entra provisioning service for Simple In/Out, change the **Provisioning Status** to **On** in the **Settings** section.

	![Screenshot of Provisioning Status Toggled On.](common/provisioning-toggle-on.png)

1. Define the users that you would like to provision to Simple In/Out by choosing the desired values in **Scope** in the **Settings** section.

	![Screenshot of Provisioning Scope.](common/provisioning-scope.png)

1. When you're ready to provision, select **Save**.

	![Screenshot of Saving Provisioning Configuration.](common/provisioning-configuration-save.png)

This operation starts the initial synchronization cycle of all users defined in **Scope** in the **Settings** section. The initial cycle takes longer to perform than subsequent cycles, which occur approximately every 40 minutes as long as the Microsoft Entra provisioning service is running.

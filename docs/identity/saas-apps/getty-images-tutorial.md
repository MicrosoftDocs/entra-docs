# Microsoft Entra SSO integration with Getty Images

In this article, you'll learn how to integrate Getty Images with Microsoft Entra ID. Getty Images finds the perfect image for your next project from the world's best photo library of creative stock photos, vector art illustrations and stock photography. When you integrate Getty Images with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Getty Images.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Getty Images with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

You'll configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on for Getty Images in a test environment. Getty Images supports both **SP** and **IDP** initiated single sign-on and **Just In Time** user provisioning.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Microsoft Entra ID with Getty Images, you need:

* A Microsoft Entra user account. If you don't already have one, you can [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* One of the following roles: Global Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator, or owner of the service principal.
* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Getty Images single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Add application and assign a test user

Before you begin the process of configuring single sign-on, you need to add the Getty Images application from the Microsoft Entra gallery. You need a test user account to assign to the application and test the single sign-on configuration.

### Add Getty Images from the Microsoft Entra gallery

### Create and assign Microsoft Entra test user

Follow the guidelines in the [create and assign a user account](~/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal-assign-users.md) article to create a test user account called B.Simon.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, and assign roles. The wizard also provides a link to the single sign-on configuration pane.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Complete the following steps to enable Microsoft Entra single sign-on.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **Getty Images** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Screenshot shows how to edit Basic SAML Configuration.](common/edit-urls.png "Basic Configuration")

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** textbox, type the URL:
    `https://gettyimages.com/`

    b. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type a URL using one of the following patterns:

    | **Reply URL** |
    |-----------|
    | `https://www.gettyimages.com/sign-in/sso/acs` |
    | `https://www.gettyimages.<Environment>/sign-in/sso/acs` |
    | `https://www.gettyimages.com.<Environment>/sign-in/sso/acs` |

1. If you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode, then perform the following step:

    In the **Sign on URL** textbox, type the URL:
    `https://www.gettyimages.in/sign-in/sso`

    > [!NOTE]
    > The Reply URL value is not real. Update this value with the actual Reply URL. Contact [Getty Images support team](mailto:support@gettyimages.com) to get the value. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section.

1. Getty Images application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

    ![Screenshot shows the image of attributes configuration.](common/default-attributes.png "Attributes")

1. In addition to above, Getty Images application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response, which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.

    | Name | Source Attribute|
    | ------------ | --------- |
    | groupid | user.groups |

    > [!Note]
    > The groupid claim is a constant value which will be provided to you by [Getty Images support team](mailto:support@gettyimages.com).

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, select copy button to copy **App Federation Metadata Url** and save it on your computer.

## Configure Getty Images SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Getty Images** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [Getty Images support team](mailto:support@gettyimages.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides. For more information, please refer [this](https://developers.gettyimages.com/single-sign-on/) link.

### Create Getty Images test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in Getty Images. Getty Images supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Getty Images, a new one is commonly created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Getty Images Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Getty Images Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Getty Images for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the Getty Images tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign-on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Getty Images for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

## Next steps

Once you configure Getty Images you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

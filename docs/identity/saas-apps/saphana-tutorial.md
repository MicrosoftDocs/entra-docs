# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) integration with SAP HANA

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate SAP HANA with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate SAP HANA with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to SAP HANA.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to SAP HANA with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To configure Microsoft Entra integration with SAP HANA, you need the following items:

- A Microsoft Entra subscription
- A SAP HANA subscription that's single sign-on (SSO) enabled
- A HANA instance that's running on any public IaaS, on-premises, Azure VM, or SAP large instances in Azure
- The XSA Administration web interface, as well as HANA Studio installed on the HANA instance

> [!NOTE]
> We do not recommend using a production environment of SAP HANA to test the steps in this tutorial. Test the integration first in the development or staging environment of the application, and then use the production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, follow these recommendations:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a Microsoft Entra environment, you can get one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/)
* SAP HANA single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* SAP HANA supports **IDP** initiated SSO.
* SAP HANA supports **just-in-time** user provisioning.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.


## Adding SAP HANA from the gallery

To configure the integration of SAP HANA into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add SAP HANA from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **SAP HANA** in the search box.
1. Select **SAP HANA** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

   1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure SAP HANA SSO

1. To configure single sign-on on the SAP HANA side, sign in to your **HANA XSA Web Console**  by going to the respective HTTPS endpoint.

	> [!NOTE]
	> In the default configuration, the URL redirects the request to a sign-in screen, which requires the credentials of an authenticated SAP HANA database user. The user who signs in must have permissions to perform SAML administration tasks.

2. In the XSA Web Interface, go to **SAML Identity Provider**. From there, select the **+** button on the bottom of the screen to display the **Add Identity Provider Info** pane. Then take the following steps:

	![Add Identity Provider](./media/saphana-tutorial/sap1.png)

	a. In the **Add Identity Provider Info** pane, paste the contents of the Metadata XML (which you downloaded) into the **Metadata** box.

	![Screenshot that shows the "Add Identity Provider Info" pane with the "Metadata" and "Name" boxes highlighted.](./media/saphana-tutorial/sap2.png)

	b. If the contents of the XML document are valid, the parsing process extracts the information that's required for the **Subject, Entity ID, and Issuer** fields in the **General data** screen area. It also extracts the information that's necessary for the URL fields in the **Destination** screen area, for example, the **Base URL and SingleSignOn URL (*)** fields.

	![Add Identity Provider settings](./media/saphana-tutorial/sap3.png)

	c. In the **Name** box of the **General Data** screen area, enter a name for the new SAML SSO identity provider.

	> [!NOTE]
	> The name of the SAML IDP is mandatory and must be unique. It appears in the list of available SAML IDPs that is displayed when you select SAML as the authentication method for SAP HANA XS applications to use. For example, you can do this in the **Authentication** screen area of the XS Artifact Administration tool.

3. Select **Save** to save the details of the SAML identity provider and to add the new SAML IDP to the list of known SAML IDPs.

	![Save button](./media/saphana-tutorial/sap4.png)

4. In HANA Studio, within the system properties of the **Configuration** tab,  filter the settings by **saml**. Then adjust the **assertion_timeout** from **10 sec** to **120 sec**.

	![assertion_timeout setting](./media/saphana-tutorial/sap7.png)


### Create SAP HANA test user

To enable Microsoft Entra users to sign in to SAP HANA, you must provision them in SAP HANA.
SAP HANA supports **just-in-time provisioning**, which is by enabled by default.

If you need to create a user manually, take the following steps:

>[!NOTE]
>You can change the external authentication that the user uses. They can authenticate with an external system such as Kerberos. For detailed information about external identities, contact your [domain administrator](https://cloudplatform.sap.com/contact.html).

1. Open the [SAP HANA Studio](https://help.sap.com/viewer/a2a49126a5c546a9864aae22c05c3d0e/2.0.01/en-us) as an administrator, and then enable the DB-User for SAML SSO.

	![Create user](./media/saphana-tutorial/sap5.png)

2. Select the invisible check box to the left of **SAML**, and then select the **Configure** link.

3. Select **Add** to add the SAML IDP.  Select the appropriate SAML IDP, and then select **OK**.

4. Add the **External Identity** (in this case, BrittaSimon). Then select **OK**.

   > [!Note]
   > You must populate the **External Identity** field for the user, and that value needs to match the **NameID** field in the SAML token from Microsoft Entra ID. The **Any** checkbox should not be checked, as this option requires the IDP to send a **SPProviderID** property in the NameID Field, which is currently not supported by Microsoft Entra ID. For more information, see [Single Sign-On Using SAML 2.0](https://help.sap.com/viewer/b3ee5778bc2e4a089d3299b82ec762a7/2.0.05/en-US/db6db355bb571014b56eb25057daec5f.html).

5. For testing purposes, assign all **XS** roles to the user.

	![Assigning roles](./media/saphana-tutorial/sap6.png)

 	> [!TIP]
  	> You should give permissions that are appropriate for your use cases only.

6. Save the user.

### Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the SAP HANA for which you set up the SSO

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the SAP HANA tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the SAP HANA for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).


## Next steps

Provisioning from SAP Cloud Identity Services to SAP HANA is a beta feature available on SAP Business Technology Platform. For more information, see how to configure provisioning of users [from Microsoft Entra ID to SAP Cloud Identity Services](sap-cloud-platform-identity-authentication-provisioning-tutorial.md), and how to configure provisioning of users [from SAP Cloud Identity Services to SAP HANA Database (Beta)](https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-identity-services/cloud-identity-services/sap-hana-database-beta).

Once you configure SAP HANA for SSO, you can enforce session control, which prevents exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

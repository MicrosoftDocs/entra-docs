# Customer intent: As an IT administrator, I want to learn how to configure single sign-on between Microsoft Entra ID and Connect1 so that I can control who has access to Connect1, enable automatic sign-in with Microsoft Entra accounts, and manage my accounts in one central location.

# Microsoft Entra SSO integration with Connect1

In this article, you'll learn how to integrate Connect1 with Microsoft Entra ID. Connect1 provides complete fleet analytics, real-time status of your fleet, viewing historical trends, receiving on-demand notifications, alerts, and reporting, creating geofences. When you integrate Connect1 with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Connect1.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Connect1 with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

You'll configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on for Connect1 in a test environment. Connect1 supports both **SP** and **IDP** initiated single sign-on.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Microsoft Entra ID with Connect1, you need:

* A Microsoft Entra user account. If you don't already have one, you can [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* One of the following roles: Global Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator, or owner of the service principal.
* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Connect1 single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Add application and assign a test user

Before you begin the process of configuring single sign-on, you need to add the Connect1 application from the Microsoft Entra gallery. You need a test user account to assign to the application and test the single sign-on configuration.

### Add Connect1 from the Microsoft Entra gallery

Add Connect1 from the Microsoft Entra application gallery to configure single sign-on with Connect1. For more information on how to add application from the gallery, see the [Quickstart: Add application from the gallery](~/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal.md).

### Create and assign Microsoft Entra test user

Follow the guidelines in the [create and assign a user account](~/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal-assign-users.md) article to create a test user account called B.Simon.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, and assign roles. The wizard also provides a link to the single sign-on configuration pane.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Complete the following steps to enable Microsoft Entra single sign-on.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **Connect1** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, the user does not have to perform any step as the app is already pre-integrated with Azure.

1. If you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode, then perform the following step:

    In the **Sign on URL** textbox, type the URL:
    `https://pct.phillips-connect.com`

1. Connect1 application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![Screenshot shows the image of attributes configuration.](common/default-attributes.png "Image")

1. In addition to above, Connect1 application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response, which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.

	| Name |  Source Attribute|
	| ---------------|  --------- |
    | companyname | user.companyname |
	| roles | user.assignedroles |

   > [!NOTE]
   > Please click [here](~/identity-platform/howto-add-app-roles-in-apps.md#app-roles-ui) to know how to configure Role in Microsoft Entra ID.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, find **Certificate (PEM)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

    ![Screenshot shows the Certificate download link.](common/certificate-base64-download.png "Certificate")

1. On the **Set up Connect1** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

	![Screenshot shows to copy configuration appropriate URL.](common/copy-configuration-urls.png "Metadata")

## Configure Connect1 SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Connect1** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (PEM)** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [Connect1 support team](mailto:xirgo_mis@sensata.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Connect1 test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon at Connect1 SSO. Work with [Connect1 SSO support team](mailto:xirgo_mis@sensata.com) to add the users in the Connect1 SSO platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Connect1 Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Connect1 Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Connect1 for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the Connect1 tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign-on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Connect1 for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

## Next steps

Once you configure Connect1 you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

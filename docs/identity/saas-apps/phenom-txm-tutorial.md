# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with Phenom TXM

In this tutorial, you will learn how to integrate Phenom TXM with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Phenom TXM with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Phenom TXM.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Phenom TXM with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Phenom TXM single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription and a user account with the Client Admin role in Service Hub.
* Along with Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator can also add or manage applications in Microsoft Entra ID.
For more information, see [Azure built-in roles](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md).

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Phenom TXM supports **SP** and **IDP** initiated SSO.

## Add Phenom TXM from the gallery

To configure the integration of Phenom TXM into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Phenom TXM from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Phenom TXM** in the search box.
1. Select **Phenom TXM** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Phenom TXM

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Phenom TXM using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish an assignment relationship between a Microsoft Entra user or group and the related Phenom TXM application, ensuring that Microsoft Entra ID passes the user's email address to Phenom TXM as a user identifier.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Phenom TXM, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Phenom TXM SSO](#configure-phenom-txm-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Phenom TXM test user](#create-phenom-txm-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Phenom TXM that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Phenom TXM Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Phenom TXM Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Phenom TXM for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the Phenom TXM tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign-on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Phenom TXM for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

## Next steps

Once you configure Phenom TXM you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

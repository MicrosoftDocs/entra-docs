## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Hubble

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Hubble using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Hubble.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Hubble, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Hubble SSO](#configure-hubble-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Hubble test user](#create-hubble-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Hubble that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Hubble SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Hubble** side, you need to upload the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** to the configuration page on Hubble.

### Create Hubble test user

In this section, you create a user called B.Simon in Hubble. Work with [Hubble client support team](mailto:cs@hubble-inc.jp) to add the users in the Hubble platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to Hubble Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Hubble Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the Hubble tile in the My Apps, this option redirects to Hubble Sign-on URL. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

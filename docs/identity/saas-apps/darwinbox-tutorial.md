To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Darwinbox, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Darwinbox SSO](#configure-darwinbox-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Darwinbox test user](#create-darwinbox-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Darwinbox that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Darwinbox SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Darwinbox** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [Darwinbox support team](https://darwinbox.com/contact-us.php). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Darwinbox test user

In this section, you create a user called B.Simon in Darwinbox. Work with [Darwinbox support team](https://darwinbox.com/contact-us.php) to add the users in the Darwinbox platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to Darwinbox Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Darwinbox Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the Darwinbox tile in the My Apps, this option redirects to Darwinbox Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

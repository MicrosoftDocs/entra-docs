# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) integration with Darwinbox

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Darwinbox with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Darwinbox with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Darwinbox.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Darwinbox with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Darwinbox single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.
> [!NOTE]
> This integration is also available to use from Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud environment. You can find this application in the Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud Application Gallery and configure it in the same way as you do from public cloud.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Darwinbox supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Add Darwinbox from the gallery

To configure the integration of Darwinbox into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Darwinbox from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Darwinbox** in the search box.
1. Select **Darwinbox** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Darwinbox

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Darwinbox using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Darwinbox.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Darwinbox, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Darwinbox SSO](#configure-darwinbox-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Darwinbox test user](#create-darwinbox-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Darwinbox that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Darwinbox SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Darwinbox** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [Darwinbox support team](https://darwinbox.com/contact-us.php). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Darwinbox test user

In this section, you create a user called B.Simon in Darwinbox. Work withÂ [Darwinbox support team](https://darwinbox.com/contact-us.php) to add the users in the Darwinbox platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Darwinbox Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Darwinbox Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Darwinbox tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Darwinbox Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Test SSO for Darwinbox (Mobile)

1. Open Darwinbox mobile application. Click on **Enter Organization URL** now enter your organization URL in the textbox and click on Arrow button.

## Next steps

Once you configure Darwinbox you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâs sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

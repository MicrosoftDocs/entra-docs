# Tutorial: Integrate Dropbox Business with Microsoft Entra ID

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Dropbox Business with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Dropbox Business with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Dropbox Business.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Dropbox Business with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Dropbox Business single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> This integration is also available to use from Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud environment. You can find this application in the Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud Application Gallery and configure it in the same way as you do from public cloud.

## Scenario description

* In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment. Dropbox Business supports **SP** initiated SSO.

* Dropbox Business supports [Automated user provisioning and deprovisioning](dropboxforbusiness-provisioning-tutorial.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add Dropbox Business from the gallery

To configure the integration of Dropbox Business into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Dropbox Business from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Dropbox Business** in the search box.
1. Select **Dropbox Business** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Dropbox Business

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.    
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with Britta Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Dropbox Business SSO](#configure-dropbox-business-sso)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Dropbox Business test user](#create-dropbox-business-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Dropbox Business that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

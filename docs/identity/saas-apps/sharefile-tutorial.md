The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

[!INCLUDE [common-prerequisites.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/common-prerequisites.md)]
* Citrix ShareFile single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> This integration is also available to use from Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud environment. You can find this application in the Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud Application Gallery and configure it in the same way as you do from public cloud.

## Scenario description

In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* Citrix ShareFile supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Add Citrix ShareFile from the gallery

To configure the integration of Citrix ShareFile into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Citrix ShareFile from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
	
	1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with Britta Simon.
	1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable Britta Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
2. **[Configure Citrix ShareFile SSO](#configure-citrix-sharefile-sso)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
	1. **[Create Citrix ShareFile test user](#create-citrix-sharefile-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Citrix ShareFile that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
3. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

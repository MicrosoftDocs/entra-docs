# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) integration with desknet's NEO

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate desknet's NEO with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate desknet's NEO with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to desknet's NEO.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to desknet's NEO with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* desknet's NEO single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* desknet's NEO supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Adding desknet's NEO from the gallery

To configure the integration of desknet's NEO into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add desknet's NEO from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).

# Configure Mobile Locker for Single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID

In this article,  you learn how to integrate Mobile Locker with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Mobile Locker with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Mobile Locker.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Mobile Locker with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Microsoft Entra ID, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID](~/identity/enterprise-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites
The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

[!INCLUDE [common-prerequisites.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/common-prerequisites.md)]
* Mobile Locker single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Mobile Locker supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO
* Once you configure Mobile Locker you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

## Adding Mobile Locker from the gallery

To configure the integration of Mobile Locker into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Mobile Locker from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Mobile Locker** in the search box.
1. Select **Mobile Locker** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Mobile Locker SSO](#configure-mobile-locker-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Mobile Locker test user](#create-mobile-locker-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Mobile Locker that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Mobile Locker SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Mobile Locker** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [Mobile Locker support team](mailto:support@mobilelocker.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Mobile Locker test user

In this section, you create a user called B.Simon in Mobile Locker. Work with [Mobile Locker support team](mailto:support@mobilelocker.com) to add the users in the Mobile Locker platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you select the Mobile Locker tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the Mobile Locker for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

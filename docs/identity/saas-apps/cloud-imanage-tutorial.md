## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Cloud iManage

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Cloud iManage using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Cloud iManage.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Cloud iManage, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-microsoft-entra-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Cloud iManage SSO](#configure-cloud-imanage-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Cloud iManage test user](#create-cloud-imanage-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Cloud iManage that's linked to the Microsoft Entra ID representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO in the Microsoft Entra admin center.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **Cloud iManage** > **Single sign-on**.

## Configure Cloud iManage SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Cloud iManage** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from Microsoft Entra admin center to [Cloud iManage support team](mailto:cloudsupport@imanage.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides. For more information, please refer this [document.](https://docs.imanage.com/cloud/cc-help/en-US/SAML_Single_Sign-On_(SSO).html)

### Create Cloud iManage test user

In this section, you create a user called B.Simon in Cloud iManage. Work withÂ [Cloud iManage support team](mailto:cloudsupport@imanage.com) to add the users in the Cloud iManage platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.
 
#### SP initiated:
 
* Select **Test this application** in Microsoft Entra admin center. This option redirects to Cloud iManage Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  
 
* Go to Cloud iManage Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.
 
#### IDP initiated:
 
* Select **Test this application** in Microsoft Entra admin center and you should be automatically signed in to the Cloud iManage for which you set up the SSO.
 
You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the Cloud iManage tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign-on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Cloud iManage for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

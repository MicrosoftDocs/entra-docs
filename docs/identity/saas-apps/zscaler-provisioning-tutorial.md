# Tutorial: Configure Zscaler for automatic user provisioning

The objective of this tutorial is to demonstrate the steps to be performed in Zscaler and Microsoft Entra ID to configure Microsoft Entra ID to automatically provision and de-provision users and/or groups to Zscaler.

> [!NOTE]
> This tutorial describes a connector built on top of the Microsoft Entra user provisioning service. For important details on what this service does, how it works, and frequently asked questions, see [Automate user provisioning and deprovisioning to SaaS applications with Microsoft Entra ID](~/identity/app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md).
>

## Prerequisites

The scenario outlined in this tutorial assumes that you already have the following:

* A Microsoft Entra tenant.
* A Zscaler tenant.
* A user account in Zscaler with Admin permissions.

> [!NOTE]
> The Microsoft Entra provisioning integration relies on the Zscaler SCIM API, which is available to Zscaler developers for accounts with the Enterprise package.

## Adding Zscaler from the gallery

Before configuring Zscaler for automatic user provisioning with Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Zscaler from the Microsoft Entra application gallery to your list of managed SaaS applications.

**To add Zscaler from the Microsoft Entra application gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the search box, type **Zscaler**, select **Zscaler** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

## Assigning users to Zscaler

Microsoft Entra ID uses a concept called "assignments" to determine which users should receive access to selected apps. In the context of automatic user provisioning, only the users and/or groups that have been "assigned" to an application in Microsoft Entra ID are synchronized.

Before configuring and enabling automatic user provisioning, you should decide which users and/or groups in Microsoft Entra ID need access to Zscaler. Once decided, you can assign these users and/or groups to Zscaler by following the instructions here:

* [Assign a user or group to an enterprise app](~/identity/enterprise-apps/assign-user-or-group-access-portal.md)

### Important tips for assigning users to Zscaler

* It is recommended that a single Microsoft Entra user is assigned to Zscaler to test the automatic user provisioning configuration. Additional users and/or groups may be assigned later.

* When assigning a user to Zscaler, you must select any valid application-specific role (if available) in the assignment dialog. Users with the **Default Access** role are excluded from provisioning.

## Configuring automatic user provisioning to Zscaler

This section guides you through the steps to configure the Microsoft Entra provisioning service to create, update, and disable users and/or groups in Zscaler based on user and/or group assignments in Microsoft Entra ID.


> [!NOTE]
> Open a [support ticket](https://help.zscaler.com/) to create a domain on Zscaler.

> [!TIP]
> You may also choose to enable SAML-based single sign-on for Zscaler, following the instructions provided in the [Zscaler single sign-on tutorial](zscaler-tutorial.md). Single sign-on can be configured independently of automatic user provisioning, though these two features compliment each other.

> [!NOTE]
> When users and groups are provisioned or de-provisioned we recommend to periodically restart provisioning to ensure that group memberships are properly updated. Doing a restart will force our service to re-evaluate all the groups and update the memberships. Please be aware that the restart can take time if you are syncing all users and groups in your tenant or have assigned large groups with 50K+ members.

### To configure automatic user provisioning for Zscaler in Microsoft Entra ID:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **Zscaler**.
1. Select the **Provisioning** tab.

	![Screenshot of the Zscaler - Provisioning Enterprise Application sidebar with the Provisioning option highlighted.](./media/zscaler-provisioning-tutorial/provisioning-tab.png)

1. Set the **Provisioning Mode** to **Automatic**.

	![Screenshot of the Provisioning page with the provisioning Mode set to Automatic.](./media/zscaler-provisioning-tutorial/provisioning-credentials.png)

1. Under the **Admin Credentials** section, input the **Tenant URL** and **Secret Token** of your Zscaler account as described in Step 6.

1. To obtain the **Tenant URL** and **Secret Token**, navigate to **Administration > Authentication Settings** in the Zscaler portal user interface and click on **SAML** under **Authentication Type**.

	![Screenshot of the Authentication Settings page.](./media/zscaler-provisioning-tutorial/secret-token-1.png)

	Click on **Configure SAML** to open **Configuration SAML** options.

	![Screenshot of the Configure S A M L dialog box with the Base U R L and Bearer Token text boxes called out.](./media/zscaler-provisioning-tutorial/secret-token-2.png)

	Select **Enable SCIM-Based Provisioning** to retrieve **Base URL** and **Bearer Token**, then save the settings. Copy the **Base URL** to **Tenant URL**, and **Bearer Token**  to **Secret Token**.

1. Upon populating the fields shown in Step 5, click **Test Connection** to ensure Microsoft Entra ID can connect to Zscaler. If the connection fails, ensure your Zscaler account has Admin permissions and try again.

	![Screenshot of the Admin Credentials section with the Test Connection option called out.](./media/zscaler-provisioning-tutorial/test-connection.png)

1. In the **Notification Email** field, enter the email address of a person or group who should receive the provisioning error notifications and check the checkbox **Send an email notification when a failure occurs**.

	![Screenshot of the Notification Email text box.](./media/zscaler-provisioning-tutorial/notification.png)

1. Click **Save**.

1. Under the **Mappings** section, select **Synchronize Microsoft Entra users to Zscaler**.

	![Screenshot of the Mappings section with the Synchronize Microsoft Entra users to Zscaler option highlighted.](./media/zscaler-provisioning-tutorial/user-mappings.png)

1. Review the user attributes that are synchronized from Microsoft Entra ID to Zscaler in the **Attribute Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the user accounts in Zscaler for update operations. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.

	![Screenshot of the Attribute Mappings section with seven mappings displayed.](./media/zscaler-provisioning-tutorial/user-attribute-mappings.png)

1. Under the **Mappings** section, select **Synchronize Microsoft Entra groups to Zscaler**.

	![Screenshot of the Mappings section with the Synchronize Microsoft Entra groups to Zscaler option highlighted.](./media/zscaler-provisioning-tutorial/group-mappings.png)

1. Review the group attributes that are synchronized from Microsoft Entra ID to Zscaler in the **Attribute Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the groups in Zscaler for update operations. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.

	![Screenshot of the Attribute Mappings section with three mappings displayed.](./media/zscaler-provisioning-tutorial/group-attribute-mappings.png)

1. To configure scoping filters, refer to the following instructions provided in the [Scoping filter tutorial](~/identity/app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).

1. To enable the Microsoft Entra provisioning service for Zscaler, change the **Provisioning Status** to **On** in the **Settings** section.

	![Screenshot of the Provisioning Status option set to On.](./media/zscaler-provisioning-tutorial/provisioning-status.png)

1. Define the users and/or groups that you would like to provision to Zscaler by choosing the desired values in **Scope** in the **Settings** section.

	![Screenshot of the Scope setting with the Sync only assigned users and groups option highlighted.](./media/zscaler-provisioning-tutorial/scoping.png)

1. When you are ready to provision, click **Save**.

	![Screenshot of the Zscaler - Provisioning Enterprise Application sidebar with the Save option called out.](./media/zscaler-provisioning-tutorial/save-provisioning.png)

This operation starts the initial synchronization of all users and/or groups defined in **Scope** in the **Settings** section. The initial sync takes longer to perform than subsequent syncs, which occur approximately every 40 minutes as long as the Microsoft Entra provisioning service is running. You can use the **Synchronization Details** section to monitor progress and follow links to provisioning activity report, which describes all actions performed by the Microsoft Entra provisioning service on Zscaler.

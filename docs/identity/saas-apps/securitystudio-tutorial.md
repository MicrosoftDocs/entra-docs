# Configure SecurityStudio for Single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID

In this article,  you learn how to integrate SecurityStudio with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate SecurityStudio with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to SecurityStudio.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to SecurityStudio with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites
The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

[!INCLUDE [common-prerequisites.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/common-prerequisites.md)]
* SecurityStudio single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* SecurityStudio supports **IDP** initiated SSO.

## Add SecurityStudio from the gallery

To configure the integration of SecurityStudio into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add SecurityStudio from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **SecurityStudio** in the search box.
1. Select **SecurityStudio** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for SecurityStudio

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with SecurityStudio using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in SecurityStudio.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with SecurityStudio, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure SecurityStudio SSO](#configure-securitystudio-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create SecurityStudio test user](#create-securitystudio-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in SecurityStudio that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **SecurityStudio** > **Single sign-on**.

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, the application is pre-configured and the necessary URLs are already pre-populated with Azure. The user needs to save the configuration by selecting the **Save** button.

1. SecurityStudio application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

1. In addition to above, SecurityStudio application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.

## Configure SecurityStudio SSO

To configure single sign-on on **SecurityStudio** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [SecurityStudio support team](mailto:support@securitystudio.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create SecurityStudio test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in SecurityStudio. Work with [SecurityStudio support team](mailto:support@securitystudio.com) to add the users in the SecurityStudio platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the SecurityStudio for which you set up the SSO.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the SecurityStudio tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the SecurityStudio for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

Once you configure SecurityStudio you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

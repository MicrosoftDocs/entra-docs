# Tutorial: Integrate Kallidus with Microsoft Entra ID

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Kallidus with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Kallidus with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Kallidus.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Kallidus with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Kallidus single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Kallidus supports **SP** initiated SSO.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add Kallidus from the gallery

To configure the integration of Kallidus into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Kallidus from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Kallidus** in the search box.
1. Select **Kallidus** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Kallidus

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Kallidus using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Kallidus.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Kallidus, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Kallidus SSO](#configure-kallidus-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Kallidus test user](#create-kallidus-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Kallidus that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Kallidus SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Kallidus** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** and a copy of the **Signing Certificate (Public)** to [Kallidus support team](https://kallidus.zendesk.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Kallidus test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Kallidus. Work with [Kallidus support team](https://kallidus.zendesk.com) to add the users in the Kallidus platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Kallidus Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow.

* Go to Kallidus Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Kallidus tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the Kallidus for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure Kallidus you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

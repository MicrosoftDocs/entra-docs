# Customer intent: As an IT administrator, I want to learn how to configure single sign-on between Microsoft Entra ID and 8x8 so that I can control who has access to 8x8, enable automatic sign-in with Microsoft Entra accounts, and manage my accounts in one central location.

# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) integration with 8x8

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate 8x8 with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate 8x8 with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to 8x8.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to 8x8 with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* An 8x8 subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> This integration is also available to use from Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud environment. You can find this application in the Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud Application Gallery and configure it in the same way as you do from public cloud.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* 8x8 supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO
* 8x8 supports [**Automated** user provisioning and deprovisioning](8x8-provisioning-tutorial.md) (recommended).

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Adding 8x8 from the gallery

To configure the integration of 8x8 into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add 8x8 from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **8x8** in the search box.
1. Select **8x8** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for 8x8

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with 8x8 using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in 8x8.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with 8x8, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure 8x8 SSO](#configure-8x8-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create 8x8 test user](#create-8x8-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in 8x8 that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Create 8x8 test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in 8x8. Work with [8x8 support team](https://www.8x8.com/about-us/contact-us) to add the users in the 8x8 platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to 8x8 Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to 8x8 Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the 8x8 for which you set up the SSO 

You can also use Microsoft Access Panel to test the application in any mode. When you click the 8x8 tile in the Access Panel, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the 8x8 for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).


## Next steps

Once you configure 8x8 you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

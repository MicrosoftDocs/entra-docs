# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with a GitHub Enterprise Cloud Organization

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate a GitHub Enterprise Cloud **Organization** with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate a GitHub Enterprise Cloud Organization with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to your GitHub Enterprise Cloud Organization.
* Manage access to your GitHub Enterprise Cloud Organization in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* A GitHub organization created in [GitHub Enterprise Cloud](https://help.github.com/articles/github-s-products/#github-enterprise), which requires the [GitHub Enterprise billing plan](https://help.github.com/articles/github-s-billing-plans/#billing-plans-for-organizations).

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* GitHub supports **SP** initiated SSO.

* GitHub supports [**Automated** user provisioning (organization invitations)](github-provisioning-tutorial.md).

## Adding GitHub from the gallery

To configure the integration of GitHub into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add GitHub from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **GitHub** in the search box.
1. Select **GitHub Enterprise Cloud - Organization** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for GitHub

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with GitHub using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in GitHub.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with GitHub, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure GitHub SSO](#configure-github-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create GitHub test user](#create-github-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in GitHub that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **GitHub** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, enter the values for the following fields:

    a. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://github.com/orgs/<Organization ID>`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://github.com/orgs/<Organization ID>/saml/consume`

    c. In the **Sign on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://github.com/orgs/<Organization ID>/sso`

	> [!NOTE]
	> Please note that these are not the real values. You have to update these values with the actual Identifier,Reply URL and Sign on URL. Here we suggest you to use the unique value of string in the Identifier. Go to GitHub Admin section to retrieve these values.

5. Your GitHub application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes, where as **Unique User Identifier (Name ID)** is mapped with **user.userprincipalname**. GitHub application expects **Unique User Identifier (Name ID)** to be mapped with **user.mail**, so you need to edit the attribute mapping by clicking on **Edit** icon and change the attribute mapping.

	![Screenshot that shows the "User Attributes" section with the "Edit" icon selected.](common/edit-attribute.png)

6. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Certificate (Base64)** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

> [!NOTE]
> Single sign-on in GitHub authenticates to a specific organization in GitHub and does not replace the authentication of GitHub itself. Therefore, if the user's github.com session has expired, you may be asked to authenticate with GitHub's ID/password during the single sign-on process.

### Create GitHub test user

The objective of this section is to create a user called Britta Simon in GitHub. GitHub supports automatic user provisioning, which is by default enabled. You can find more details [here](github-provisioning-tutorial.md) on how to configure automatic user provisioning.

**If you need to create user manually, perform following steps:**

1. Log in to your GitHub company site as an administrator.

2. Click **People**.

    ![Screenshot shows the GitHub site with People selected.](./media/github-tutorial/people.png "People")

3. Click **Invite member**.

    ![Screenshot that shows the Invite Users.](./media/github-tutorial/invite-member.png "Invite Users")

4. On the **Invite member** dialog page, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Email** textbox, type the email address of Britta Simon account.

    ![Screenshot that shows the Invite People.](./media/github-tutorial/email-box.png "Invite People")

    b. Click **Send Invitation**.

    ![Screenshot that shows the "Invite member" dialog page with "Member" selected and the "Send invitation" button selected.](./media/github-tutorial/send-invitation.png "Invite People")

    > [!NOTE]
    > The Microsoft Entra account holder will receive an email and follow a link to confirm their account before it becomes active.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to GitHub Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to GitHub Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the GitHub tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to GitHub Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure GitHub you can enforce Session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to Chargebee Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Chargebee Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Chargebee for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the Chargebee tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Chargebee for which you set up the SSO.

# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with eKincare

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate eKincare with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate eKincare with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to eKincare.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to eKincare with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To configure Microsoft Entra integration with eKincare, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a Microsoft Entra environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* eKincare single sign-on enabled subscription.
* Along with Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator can also add or manage applications in Microsoft Entra ID.
For more information, see [Azure built-in roles](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md).

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* eKincare supports **IDP** initiated SSO.

* eKincare supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Add eKincare from the gallery

To configure the integration of eKincare into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add eKincare from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **eKincare** in the search box.
1. Select **eKincare** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for eKincare

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with eKincare using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in eKincare.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with eKincare, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure eKincare SSO](#configure-ekincare-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create eKincare test user](#create-ekincare-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in eKincare that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Assign the Microsoft Entra test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use single sign-on by granting access to eKincare.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).

1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure eKincare SSO

To configure single sign-on on **eKincare** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [eKincare support team](mailto:tech@ekincare.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create eKincare test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in eKincare. eKincare supports **just-in-time user provisioning**, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in eKincare, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the eKincare for which you set up the SSO.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the eKincare tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the eKincare for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

## Next steps

Once you configure eKincare you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

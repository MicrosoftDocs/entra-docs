# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra integration with LINE WORKS

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate LINE WORKS with Microsoft Entra ID.
Integrating LINE WORKS with Microsoft Entra ID provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to LINE WORKS.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to LINE WORKS (Single Sign-On) with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To configure Microsoft Entra integration with LINE WORKS, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a Microsoft Entra environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
* LINE WORKS single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* LINE WORKS supports **SP** initiated SSO

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Adding LINE WORKS from the gallery

To configure the integration of LINE WORKS into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add LINE WORKS from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **LINE WORKS** in the search box.
1. Select **LINE WORKS** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with LINE WORKS using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in LINE WORKS.

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    * **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with Britta Simon.
    * **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
2. **[Configure LINE WORKS SSO](#configure-line-works-sso)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
    * **[Create LINE WORKS test user](#create-line-works-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in LINE WORKS that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
3. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

# Customer intent: As an IT administrator, I want to learn how to configure single sign-on between Microsoft Entra ID and WebTMA so that I can control who has access to WebTMA, enable automatic sign-in with Microsoft Entra accounts, and manage my accounts in one central location.

# Microsoft Entra SSO integration with WebTMA

In this article, you'll learn how to integrate WebTMA with Microsoft Entra ID. WebTMA is a CMMS (Computerized Maintenance Management System) Asset, Space, Parts and work order management system. When you integrate WebTMA with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to WebTMA.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to WebTMA with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

You'll configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on for WebTMA in a test environment. WebTMA supports both **SP** and **IDP** initiated single sign-on and also supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Microsoft Entra ID with WebTMA, you need:

* A Microsoft Entra user account. If you don't already have one, you can [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* One of the following roles: Global Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator, or owner of the service principal.
* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* WebTMA single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Add application and assign a test user

Before you begin the process of configuring single sign-on, you need to add the WebTMA application from the Microsoft Entra gallery. You need a test user account to assign to the application and test the single sign-on configuration.

### Add WebTMA from the Microsoft Entra gallery

Add WebTMA from the Microsoft Entra application gallery to configure single sign-on with WebTMA. For more information on how to add application from the gallery, see the [Quickstart: Add application from the gallery](~/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal.md).

<a name='create-and-assign-azure-ad-test-user'></a>

### Create and assign Microsoft Entra test user

Follow the guidelines in the [create and assign a user account](~/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal-assign-users.md) article to create a test user account called B.Simon.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, and assign roles. The wizard also provides a link to the single sign-on configuration pane.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Complete the following steps to enable Microsoft Entra single sign-on.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **WebTMA** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Screenshot shows how to edit Basic SAML Configuration.](common/edit-urls.png "Basic Configuration")

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

	a. In the **Identifier** textbox, type the URL:
    `http://www.webtma.net`

    b. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<hostName>/<loginApplicationPath>/SAMLService.aspx?c=<clientName>`

1. If you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode, then perform the following step:

    In the **Sign on URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<hostName>/<loginApplicationPath>/SAMLLogin.aspx?c=<clientName>`

    > [!NOTE]
    > These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Reply URL and Sign on URL. Contact [Respondent Client support team](mailto:support@tmasystems.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section.

1. WebTMA application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![Screenshot shows the image of attributes configuration.](common/default-attributes.png "Image")

1. In addition to above, WebTMA application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response, which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.

	| Name |  Source Attribute|
	| ---------------|  --------- |
    | email | user.mail |
	| FirstName | user.givenname |
	| LastName | user.surname |

1. On the **Set-up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

    ![Screenshot shows the Certificate download link.](common/metadataxml.png "Certificate")

1. On the **Set up WebTMA** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

	![Screenshot shows to copy configuration appropriate URL.](common/copy-configuration-urls.png "Metadata")

## Configure WebTMA SSO

To configure single sign-on on **WebTMA** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [WebTMA support team](mailto:support@tmasystems.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create WebTMA test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in WebTMA. WebTMA supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in WebTMA, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to WebTMA Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to WebTMA Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the WebTMA for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the WebTMA tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign-on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the WebTMA for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

## Next steps

Once you configure WebTMA you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

# Configure WATS for automatic user provisioning with Microsoft Entra ID

This article describes the steps you need to perform in both WATS and Microsoft Entra ID to configure automatic user provisioning. When configured, Microsoft Entra ID automatically provisions and de-provisions users to [WATS](https://wats.com) using the Microsoft Entra provisioning service. For important details on what this service does, how it works, and frequently asked questions, see [Automate user provisioning and deprovisioning to SaaS applications with Microsoft Entra ID](~/identity/app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md). 


## Supported capabilities
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create users in WATS.
> * Remove users in WATS when they don't require access anymore.
> * Keep user attributes synchronized between Microsoft Entra ID and WATS.
> * [Single sign-on](~/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal-setup-oidc-sso.md) to WATS (recommended).

## Prerequisites

The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

* [A Microsoft Entra tenant](~/identity-platform/quickstart-create-new-tenant.md) 
* One of the following roles: [Application Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#application-administrator), [Cloud Application Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#cloud-application-administrator), or [Application Owner](/entra/fundamentals/users-default-permissions#owned-enterprise-applications).
* A user account in WATS with Admin permissions.

## Step 1: Plan your provisioning deployment
1. Learn about [how the provisioning service works](~/identity/app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md).
1. Determine who's in [scope for provisioning](~/identity/app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).
1. Determine what data to [map between Microsoft Entra ID and WATS](~/identity/app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes.md).

## Step 2: Configure WATS to support provisioning with Microsoft Entra ID
Please refer to the [WATS Provisioning](https://support.virinco.com/hc/en-us/articles/7978299009948-WATS-Provisioning-SCIM-) article to set up any necessary requirements for provisioning through Microsoft Entra ID. 

## Step 3: Define who is in scope for provisioning 

[!INCLUDE [create-assign-users-provisioning.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/create-assign-users-provisioning.md)]

## Step 4: Configure automatic user provisioning to WATS 

This section guides you through the steps to configure the Microsoft Entra provisioning service to create, update, and disable users in TestApp based on user assignments in Microsoft Entra ID.

### To configure automatic user provisioning for WATS in Microsoft Entra ID:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps**

1. In the applications list, select **WATS**.

1. Select the **Provisioning** tab.

1. Set the **Provisioning Mode** to **Automatic**.

	![Screenshot of Provisioning tab automatic.](common/provisioning-automatic.png)

1. Under the **Admin Credentials** section, input your WATS Tenant URL and Secret Token. Select **Test Connection** to ensure Microsoft Entra ID can connect to WATS. If the connection fails, ensure your WATS account has Admin permissions and try again.

1. In the **Notification Email** field, enter the email address of a person who should receive the provisioning error notifications and select the **Send an email notification when a failure occurs** check box.

1. Select **Save**.

1. Under the **Mappings** section, select **Synchronize Microsoft Entra users to WATS**.

1. Review the user attributes that are synchronized from Microsoft Entra ID to WATS in the **Attribute-Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the user accounts in WATS for update operations. If you choose to change the [matching target attribute](~/identity/app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes.md), you need to ensure that the WATS API supports filtering users based on that attribute. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.

   |Attribute|Type|Supported for filtering|Required by WATS|
   |---|---|---|---|
   |userName|String|&check;|&check;
   |active|Boolean||
   |emails[type eq "work"].value|String||&check;
   |name.givenName|String||&check;
   |name.familyName|String||&check;
   |roles[primary eq "True"].value|String||

1. To configure scoping filters, refer to the following instructions provided in the [Scoping filter  article](~/identity/app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).

1. To enable the Microsoft Entra provisioning service for WATS, change the **Provisioning Status** to **On** in the **Settings** section.

	![Screenshot of Provisioning Status Toggled On.](common/provisioning-toggle-on.png)

1. Define the users that you would like to provision to WATS by choosing the desired values in **Scope** in the **Settings** section.

	![Screenshot of Provisioning Scope.](common/provisioning-scope.png)

1. When you're ready to provision, select **Save**.

	![Screenshot of Saving Provisioning Configuration.](common/provisioning-configuration-save.png)

This operation starts the initial synchronization cycle of all users defined in **Scope** in the **Settings** section. The initial cycle takes longer to perform than subsequent cycles, which occur approximately every 40 minutes as long as the Microsoft Entra provisioning service is running. 

## Step 5: Monitor your deployment

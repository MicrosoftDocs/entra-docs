# Customer intent: As an IT administrator, I want to learn how to configure single sign-on between Microsoft Entra ID and ADP (OIDC) so that I can control who has access to ADP (OIDC), enable automatic sign-in with Microsoft Entra accounts, and manage my accounts in one central location.

# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) integration with ADP (OIDC)

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate ADP (OIDC) with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate ADP (OIDC) with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

Use Microsoft Entra ID to control who can access ADP (OIDC).
Enable your users to be automatically signed in to ADP (OIDC) with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
Manage your accounts in one central location: the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* ADP (OIDC) single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

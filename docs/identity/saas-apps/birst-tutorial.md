# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with Birst Agile Business Analytics

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Birst Agile Business Analytics with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Birst Agile Business Analytics with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Birst Agile Business Analytics.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Birst Agile Business Analytics with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Birst Agile Business Analytics single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.
* Along with Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator can also add or manage applications in Microsoft Entra ID.
For more information, see [Azure built-in roles](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md).

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* Birst Agile Business Analytics supports **SP** initiated SSO.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add Birst Agile Business Analytics from the gallery

To configure the integration of Birst Agile Business Analytics into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Birst Agile Business Analytics from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure Birst Agile Business Analytics SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Birst Agile Business Analytics** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [Birst Agile Business Analytics support team](mailto:info@birst.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

> [!NOTE]
> Mention to Birst team that this integration needs SHA256 Algorithm (SHA1 will not be supported) so that they can set the SSO on the appropriate server like **app2101** , and so on.

### Create Birst Agile Business Analytics test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Birst Agile Business Analytics. Work withÂ [Birst Agile Business Analytics support team](mailto:info@birst.com) to add the users in the Birst Agile Business Analytics platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Birst Agile Business Analytics Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Birst Agile Business Analytics Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Birst Agile Business Analytics tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Birst Agile Business Analytics Sign-on URL. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

## Next steps

Once you configure Birst Agile Business Analytics you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâs sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

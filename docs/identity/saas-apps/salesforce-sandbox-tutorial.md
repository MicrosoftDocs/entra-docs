# Customer intent: As an IT administrator, I want to learn how to configure single sign-on between Microsoft Entra ID and Salesforce Sandbox so that I can control who has access to Salesforce Sandbox, enable automatic sign-in with Microsoft Entra accounts, and manage my accounts in one central location.

# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) integration with Salesforce Sandbox

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Salesforce Sandbox with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Salesforce Sandbox with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Salesforce Sandbox.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Salesforce Sandbox with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Salesforce Sandbox single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* Salesforce Sandbox supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO
* Salesforce Sandbox supports **Just In Time** user provisioning
* Salesforce Sandbox supports [**Automated** user provisioning](salesforce-sandbox-provisioning-tutorial.md)

## Adding Salesforce Sandbox from the gallery

To configure the integration of Salesforce Sandbox into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Salesforce Sandbox from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Salesforce Sandbox** in the search box.
1. Select **Salesforce Sandbox** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Salesforce Sandbox

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Salesforce Sandbox using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Salesforce Sandbox.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Salesforce Sandbox, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Salesforce Sandbox SSO](#configure-salesforce-sandbox-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Salesforce Sandbox test user](#create-salesforce-sandbox-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Salesforce Sandbox that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Create Salesforce Sandbox test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in Salesforce Sandbox. Salesforce Sandbox supports just-in-time provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Salesforce Sandbox, a new one is created when you attempt to access Salesforce Sandbox. Salesforce Sandbox also supports automatic user provisioning, you can find more details [here](salesforce-sandbox-provisioning-tutorial.md) on how to configure automatic user provisioning.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Salesforce Sandbox Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Salesforce Sandbox Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Salesforce Sandbox for which you set up the SSO 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the Salesforce Sandbox tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Salesforce Sandbox for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure the Salesforce Sandbox you can enforce session controls, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session controls extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

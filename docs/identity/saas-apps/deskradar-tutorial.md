1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **Deskradar** > **Single sign-on**.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, enter the values for the following fields:

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<YOURDOMAIN>.deskradar.cloud`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<YOURDOMAIN>.deskradar.cloud/auth/sso/saml/consume`

1. Select **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<YOURDOMAIN>.deskradar.cloud/auth/sso/saml/login`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values aren't real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Sign-on URL. Replace **YOURDOMAIN** with your Deskradar instance domain. Contact [Deskradar Client support team](mailto:support@deskradar.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section.

1. Deskradar application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	| Name | Source Attribute|
	| ---------------| --------- |
	| FirstName | user.givenname |

### Create Deskradar test user

In this section, you create a user called B.Simon in Deskradar. Work with [Deskradar Client support team](mailto:support@deskradar.com) to add the users in the Deskradar platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to Deskradar Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Deskradar Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Deskradar for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the Deskradar tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Deskradar for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

# Microsoft Entra SSO integration with Canva

In this article, you'll learn how to integrate Canva with Microsoft Entra ID. Canva is your photo editor, video editor, and graphic design tool all in one app. Create stunning social media posts, videos, cards, flyers, photo collages & more. When you integrate Canva with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Canva.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Canva with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

You'll configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on for Canva in a test environment. Canva supports **IDP** initiated single sign-on and **Just In Time** user provisioning. Canva also supports [Automated user provisioning](canva-provisioning-tutorial.md).

## Prerequisites

To integrate Microsoft Entra ID with Canva, you need:

* A Microsoft Entra user account. If you don't already have one, you can [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* One of the following roles: Global Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator, or owner of the service principal.
* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Canva single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Add application and assign a test user

Before you begin the process of configuring single sign-on, you need to add the Canva application from the Microsoft Entra gallery. You need a test user account to assign to the application and test the single sign-on configuration.

### Add Canva from the Microsoft Entra gallery

Add Canva from the Microsoft Entra application gallery to configure single sign-on with Canva. For more information on how to add application from the gallery, see the [Quickstart: Add application from the gallery](~/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal.md).

### Create and assign Microsoft Entra test user

Follow the guidelines in the [create and assign a user account](~/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal-assign-users.md) article to create a test user account called B.Simon.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, and assign roles. The wizard also provides a link to the single sign-on configuration pane.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Complete the following steps to enable Microsoft Entra single sign-on.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **Canva** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, the user does not have to perform any step as the app is already pre-integrated with Azure.

1. Your Canva application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows an example for this. The default value of **Unique User Identifier** is **user.userprincipalname** but Canva expects this to be mapped with the user's object id. For that you can use **user.objectid** attribute from the list or use the appropriate attribute value based on your organization configuration and select Name identifier format as **Persistent** from the dropdown.

	![Screenshot shows the image of custom attribute mappings.](common/default-attributes.png "Image")

1. On the **Set-up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, find **Certificate (Base64)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

1. On the **Set up Canva** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

## Configure Canva SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Canva** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [Canva support team](mailto:support@canva.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Canva test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in Canva. Canva supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Canva, a new one is commonly created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Canva for which you set up the SSO.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Canva tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the Canva for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

## Next steps

Once you configure Canva you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

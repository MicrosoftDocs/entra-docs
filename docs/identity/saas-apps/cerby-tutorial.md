## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Cerby

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Cerby using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Cerby.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Cerby, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Cerby SSO](#configure-cerby-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Cerby test user](#create-cerby-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Cerby that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **Cerby** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, enter the values for the following fields:

    a. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `urn:amazon:cognito:sp:<ID>`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<CustomerName>-cerbyauth.auth.us-east-2.amazoncognito.com/saml2/idpresponse`

	c. In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using one of the following patterns:

    | Sign on URL |
    |--------|
    | `https://app.cerby.com` |
    | `https://<CustomerName>.cerby.com` |
    |

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values aren't real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Sign on URL. Contact [Cerby Client support team](mailto:help@cerby.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section.

1. Your Cerby application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows an example for this. The default value of **Name** is **user.userprincipalname** but Cerby expects this to be mapped with the user's givenname. For that you can use **user.givenname** attribute from the list or use the appropriate attribute value based on your organization configuration.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, In the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, select copy button to copy **App Federation Metadata Url** and save it on your computer.

## Configure Cerby SSO

To configure single sign-on on Cerby side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [Cerby support team](mailto:help@cerby.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Cerby test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in Cerby. Cerby supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Cerby, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to Cerby Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Cerby Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the Cerby tile in the My Apps, this option redirects to Cerby Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

# Customer intent: As an IT administrator, I want to learn how to automatically provision and deprovision user accounts from Microsoft Entra ID to Grammarly so that I can streamline the user management process and ensure that users have the appropriate access to Grammarly.

# Tutorial: Configure Grammarly for automatic user provisioning

This tutorial describes the steps you need to perform in both Grammarly and Microsoft Entra ID to configure automatic user provisioning. When configured, Microsoft Entra ID automatically provisions and de-provisions users and groups to [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) using the Microsoft Entra provisioning service. For important details on what this service does, how it works, and frequently asked questions, see [Automate user provisioning and deprovisioning to SaaS applications with Microsoft Entra ID](~/identity/app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md). 


## Capabilities Supported
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create users in Grammarly
> * Remove users in Grammarly when they do not require access anymore
> * Keep user attributes synchronized between Microsoft Entra ID and Grammarly

## Prerequisites

The scenario outlined in this tutorial assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

* [A Microsoft Entra tenant](~/identity-platform/quickstart-create-new-tenant.md) 
* A user account in Microsoft Entra ID with [permission](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md) to configure provisioning (e.g. Application Administrator, Cloud Application administrator, Application Owner, or Global Administrator). 
* A Grammarly Business account with admin access.

## Step 1: Plan your provisioning deployment
1. Learn about [how the provisioning service works](~/identity/app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md).
1. Determine who will be in [scope for provisioning](~/identity/app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).
1. Determine what data to [map between Microsoft Entra ID and Grammarly](~/identity/app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes.md).

## Step 2: Configure Grammarly to support provisioning with Microsoft Entra ID

Reach out to your Grammarly representative, or write to <support@grammarly.com> to request for your provisioning token.

<a name='step-3-add-grammarly-from-the-azure-ad-application-gallery'></a>

## Step 3: Add Grammarly from the Microsoft Entra application gallery

Add Grammarly from the Microsoft Entra application gallery to start managing provisioning to Grammarly. If you've previously set up Grammarly for SSO, you can use the same application. We recommend that you create a separate app when you test out the integration initially. To learn more about how to add an application from the gallery, see [this quickstart](~/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal.md).

## Step 4: Define who will be in scope for provisioning

You can use the Microsoft Entra provisioning service to scope who will be provisioned based on assignment to the application or based on attributes of the user or group. If you choose to scope who will be provisioned to your app based on assignment, you can use the following [steps](~/identity/enterprise-apps/assign-user-or-group-access-portal.md) to assign users and groups to the application. If you choose to scope who will be provisioned based solely on attributes of the user or group, you can use a scoping filter as described in [Provision apps with scoping filters](~/identity/app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).

* When you assign users and groups to Grammarly, you must select a role other than **Default Access**. Users with the default access role are excluded from provisioning and will be marked as not effectively entitled in the provisioning logs. If the only role available on the application is the default access role, you can [update the application manifest](~/identity-platform/howto-add-app-roles-in-apps.md) to add more roles.

* Start small. Test with a small set of users and groups before you roll out to everyone. When scope for provisioning is set to assigned users and groups, you can control this option by assigning one or two users or groups to the app. When scope is set to all users and groups, you can specify an [attribute-based scoping filter](~/identity/app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).


## Step 5: Configure automatic user provisioning to Grammarly

This section guides you through the steps to configure the Microsoft Entra provisioning service to create, update, and disable users or groups in TestApp based on user or group assignments in Microsoft Entra ID.

### Configure automatic user provisioning for Grammarly in Microsoft Entra ID

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications**.

	![Screenshot that shows the Enterprise applications pane.](common/enterprise-applications.png)

1. In the list of applications, select **Grammarly**.

	![Screenshot that shows the Grammarly link in the list of applications.](common/all-applications.png)

1. Select the **Provisioning** tab.

	![Screenshot that shows the Provisioning tab.](common/provisioning.png)

1. Set **Provisioning Mode** to **Automatic**.

	![Screenshot that shows Provisioning Mode set to Automatic.](common/provisioning-automatic.png)

1. Under the **Admin Credentials** section, in the enter **Tenant URL** field enter `https://sso.grammarly.com/scim/v2`, and in the **Secret Token** field enter the token provided by Grammarly (see Step 2 above). Click **Test Connection** to ensure Microsoft Entra ID can connect to Grammarly. If the connection fails, ensure your Grammarly account has Admin permissions and try again.

1. In the **Notification Email** box, enter the email address of a person or group who should receive the provisioning error notifications. Select the **Send an email notification when a failure occurs** check box.

	![Screenshot that shows the Notification Email box.](common/provisioning-notification-email.png)

1. Select **Save**.

1. In the **Mappings** section, select **Synchronize Microsoft Entra users to Grammarly**.

1. Review the user attributes that are synchronized from Microsoft Entra ID to Grammarly in the **Attribute-Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the user accounts in Grammarly for update operations. If you change the [matching target attribute](~/identity/app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes.md), you'll need to ensure that the Grammarly API supports filtering users based on that attribute. Select **Save** to commit any changes.

   |Attribute|Type|Supported for filtering|
   |---|---|---|
   |userName|String|&check;|
   |externalId|String|
   |active|Boolean|
   |displayName|String|
   |emails[type eq "work"].value|String|


1. To configure scoping filters, see the instructions provided in the [Scoping filter tutorial](~/identity/app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).

1. To enable the Microsoft Entra provisioning service for Grammarly, change **Provisioning Status** to **On** in the **Settings** section.

	![Screenshot that shows the Provisioning Status toggled On.](common/provisioning-toggle-on.png)

1. Define the users or groups that you want to provision to Grammarly by selecting the desired values in **Scope** in the **Settings** section.

	![Screenshot that shows the Provisioning Scope.](common/provisioning-scope.png)

1. When you're ready to provision, select **Save**.

	![Screenshot that shows the Save button.](common/provisioning-configuration-save.png)

This operation starts the initial synchronization cycle of all users and groups defined in **Scope** in the **Settings** section. The initial cycle takes longer to perform than subsequent cycles, which occur about every 40 minutes as long as the Microsoft Entra provisioning service is running.

## Step 6: Monitor your deployment

After you've configured provisioning, use the following resources to monitor your deployment:

* Use the [provisioning logs](~/identity/monitoring-health/concept-provisioning-logs.md) to determine which users were provisioned successfully or unsuccessfully.
* Check the [progress bar](~/identity/app-provisioning/application-provisioning-when-will-provisioning-finish-specific-user.md) to see the status of the provisioning cycle and how close it is to completion.
* If the provisioning configuration seems to be in an unhealthy state, the application will go into quarantine. To learn more about quarantine states, see [Application provisioning status of quarantine](~/identity/app-provisioning/application-provisioning-quarantine-status.md).

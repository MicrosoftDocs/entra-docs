### Create GaggleAMP test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in GaggleAMP. GaggleAMP supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in GaggleAMP, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Visit the invitation page of your Gaggle, you can find its unique link on the Manager View, menu **option Members > Invite**.

* Select the **Sign in with SAML** button to initiate the login flow from there.

#### IdP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to GaggleAMP.

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the GaggleAMP tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the GaggleAMP for which you set up the SSO.

# Configure Panorays for Single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID

In this article,  you learn how to integrate Panorays with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Panorays with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Panorays.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Panorays with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites
The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

[!INCLUDE [common-prerequisites.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/common-prerequisites.md)]
* Panorays single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> This integration is also available to use from Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud environment. You can find this application in the Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud Application Gallery and configure it in the same way as you do from public cloud.

## Scenario description

In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Panorays supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.
* Panorays supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Adding Panorays from the gallery

To configure the integration of Panorays into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Panorays from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Panorays** in the search box.
1. Select **Panorays** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Panorays

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Panorays using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Panorays.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Panorays, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Panorays SSO](#configure-panorays-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Panorays test user](#create-panorays-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Panorays that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **Panorays** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, the application is pre-configured and the necessary URLs are already pre-populated with Azure. The user needs to save the configuration by selecting the Save button.

1. Your Panorays application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes, whereas **Unique User Identifier** is mapped with **user.userprincipalname**. Panorays application expects **Unique User Identifier** to be mapped with **user.mail**, so you need to edit the attribute mapping by selecting **Edit** icon and change the attribute mapping.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, In the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, select copy button to copy **App Federation Metadata Url** and save it on your computer.

## Configure Panorays SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Panorays** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [Panorays support team](mailto:support@panorays.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Panorays test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in Panorays. Panorays supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Panorays, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to Panorays Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Panorays Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Panorays for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the Panorays tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Panorays for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

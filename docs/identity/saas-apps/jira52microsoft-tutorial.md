	c. In **Login Button Name** type the name of button your organization wants the users to see on login screen.

	d. In **SAML User ID Locations** select either **User ID is in the NameIdentifier element of the Subject statement** or **User ID is in an Attribute element**.  This ID has to be the JIRA user ID. If the user ID is not matched, then system will not allow users to sign in.

	> [!Note]
	> Default SAML User ID location is Name Identifier. You can change this to an attribute option and enter the appropriate attribute name.

	e. If you select **User ID is in an Attribute element** option, then in **Attribute name** textbox type the name of the attribute where User ID is expected. 

	f. If you are using the federated domain (like ADFS etc.) with Microsoft Entra ID, then click on the **Enable Home Realm Discovery** option and configure the **Domain Name**.

	g. In **Domain Name** type the domain name here in case of the ADFS-based login.

	h. Check **Enable Single Sign out** if you wish to sign out from Microsoft Entra ID when a user signs out from JIRA. 

	i. Click **Save** button to save the settings.

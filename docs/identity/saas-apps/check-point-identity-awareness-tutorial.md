# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) integration with Check Point Identity Awareness

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Check Point Identity Awareness with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Check Point Identity Awareness with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Check Point Identity Awareness.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Check Point Identity Awareness with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Check Point Identity Awareness single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Check Point Identity Awareness supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Adding Check Point Identity Awareness from the gallery

To configure the integration of Check Point Identity Awareness into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Check Point Identity Awareness from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Check Point Identity Awareness** in the search box.
1. Select **Check Point Identity Awareness** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Check Point Identity Awareness

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Check Point Identity Awareness using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Check Point Identity Awareness.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Check Point Identity Awareness, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Check Point Identity Awareness SSO](#configure-check-point-identity-awareness-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Check Point Identity Awareness test user](#create-check-point-identity-awareness-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Check Point Identity Awareness that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Check Point Identity Awareness Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Check Point Identity Awareness Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Check Point Identity Awareness tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Check Point Identity Awareness Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).


## Next steps

Once you configure Check Point Identity Awareness you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâs sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

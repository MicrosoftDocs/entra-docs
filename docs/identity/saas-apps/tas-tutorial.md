# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra integration with TAS

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate TAS with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate TAS with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to TAS.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to TAS with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* TAS single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* TAS supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.

## Add TAS from the gallery

To configure the integration of TAS into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add TAS from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **TAS** in the search box.
1. Select **TAS** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for TAS

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with TAS using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in TAS.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with TAS, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure TAS SSO](#configure-tas-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create TAS test user](#create-tas-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in TAS that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. You will update these with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Sign-on URL which is explained later in the tutorial. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section.

6. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Certificate (Base64)** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

   1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure TAS SSO

1. In a different web browser window, login to TAS as an Administrator.

2. On the left side of menu, click on **Settings** and navigate to **Administrator** and then click on **Manage Single sign on**.

	>[!NOTE]
	> Contact [TAS support team](mailto:support@combtas.com) to get the IP Address.

	g. Copy the **Assertion Service** URL in the setup page and paste it into the **Reply URL** textbox of  **Basic SAML Configuration** in Azure portal.

	h. Click **Insert SSO row**.

### Create TAS test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in TAS. Work with [TAS support team](mailto:support@combtas.com) to add the users in the TAS platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to TAS Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to TAS Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the TAS for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the TAS tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the TAS for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure TAS you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

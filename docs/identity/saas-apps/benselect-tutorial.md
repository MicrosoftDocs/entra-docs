# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with BenSelect

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate BenSelect with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate BenSelect with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to BenSelect.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to BenSelect with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* BenSelect single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* BenSelect supports **IDP** initiated SSO.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add BenSelect from the gallery

To configure the integration of BenSelect into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add BenSelect from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **BenSelect** in the search box.
1. Select **BenSelect** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for BenSelect

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with BenSelect using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in BenSelect.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with BenSelect, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure BenSelect SSO](#configure-benselect-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create BenSelect test user](#create-benselect-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in BenSelect that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Assign the Microsoft Entra test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use single sign-on by granting access to BenSelect.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **BenSelect**.

1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure BenSelect SSO

To configure single sign-on on **BenSelect** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Raw)** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [BenSelect support team](mailto:support@selerix.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

> [!NOTE]
> You need to mention that this integration requires the SHA256 algorithm (SHA1 is not supported) to set the SSO on the appropriate server like app2101 etc.

### Create BenSelect test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in BenSelect. Work with [BenSelect support team](mailto:support@selerix.com) to add the users in the BenSelect platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the BenSelect for which you set up the SSO.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the BenSelect tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the BenSelect for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

## Next steps

Once you configure BenSelect you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

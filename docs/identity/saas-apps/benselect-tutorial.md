1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure BenSelect SSO](#configure-benselect-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create BenSelect test user](#create-benselect-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in BenSelect that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.

## Configure BenSelect SSO

To configure single sign-on on **BenSelect** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Raw)** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [BenSelect support team](mailto:support@selerix.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

> [!NOTE]
> You need to mention that this integration requires the SHA256 algorithm (SHA1 isn't supported) to set the SSO on the appropriate server like app2101, and so on.

### Create BenSelect test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in BenSelect. Work with [BenSelect support team](mailto:support@selerix.com) to add the users in the BenSelect platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the BenSelect for which you set up the SSO.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the BenSelect tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the BenSelect for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

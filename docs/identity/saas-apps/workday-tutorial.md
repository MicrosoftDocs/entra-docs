# Configure Workday for Single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID

In this article,  you learn how to integrate Workday with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Workday with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Workday.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Workday with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites
The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

[!INCLUDE [common-prerequisites.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/common-prerequisites.md)]
* Workday single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Workday supports **SP** initiated SSO.

* Workday Mobile application can now be configured with Microsoft Entra ID for enabling SSO. For more details on how to configure, please follow [this](workday-mobile-tutorial.md) link.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Adding Workday from the gallery

To configure the integration of Workday into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Workday from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Workday** in the search box.
1. Select **Workday** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Workday

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Workday, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
2. **[Configure Workday](#configure-workday)** to configure the SSO settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Workday test user](#create-workday-test-user)** to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Workday that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
3. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **Workday** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Screenshot showing Edit Basic SAML Configuration.](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** page, enter the values for the following fields:

	a. In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://impl.workday.com/<tenant>/login-saml2.flex`

	b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://impl.workday.com/<tenant>/login-saml.htmld`

    c. In the **Logout URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://impl.workday.com/<tenant>/login-saml.htmld`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values aren't the real. Update these values with the actual Sign-on URL, Reply URL and Logout URL. Your reply URL must have a subdomain for example: www, wd2, wd3, wd3-impl, wd5, wd5-impl).
    > Using something like `http://www.myworkday.com` works but `http://myworkday.com` doesn't. Contact [Workday Client support team](https://www.workday.com/en-us/customer-experience/support.html) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section.

1. Your Workday application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes, whereas **nameidentifier** is mapped with **user.userprincipalname**. Workday application expects **nameidentifier** to be mapped with **user.mail**, **UPN**, and so on. so you need to edit the attribute mapping by selecting **Edit** icon and change the attribute mapping.

	![Screenshot shows User Attributes with the Edit icon selected.](common/edit-attribute.png)

	> [!NOTE]
    > Here we have mapped the Name ID with UPN (user.userprincipalname) as default. You need to map the Name ID with actual User ID in your Workday account (your email, UPN, and so on) for successful working of SSO.

1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

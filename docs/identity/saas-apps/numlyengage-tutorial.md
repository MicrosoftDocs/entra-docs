## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **NumlyEngage™** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, enter the values for the following fields:

	a. In the **Sign on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.numly.io/registration?mail=<CUSTOM_IDENTIFIER>`

    b. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `urn:amazon:cognito:sp:<NUMLY_ENGAGE_SPECIFIC_IDENTIFIER>`

    c. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.NUMLYENGAGE_SPECIFIC_amazoncognito.com/saml2/idpresponse`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values aren't real. Update these values with the actual Sign on URL, Reply URL and Identifier. Contact [NumlyEngage™ Client support team](mailto:numlyengage-support@numly.io) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section.

1. NumlyEngage™ application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![image](common/default-attributes.png)

1. In addition to above, NumlyEngage™ application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.
	
	| Name |  Source Attribute |
	| ------------------ | --------- |
	| Email | user.mail |
	| Phone number | user.telephonenumber |

## Configure NumlyEngage SSO

To configure single sign-on on **NumlyEngage™** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [NumlyEngage™ support team](mailto:numlyengage-support@numly.io). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create NumlyEngage test user

In this section, you create a user called B.Simon in NumlyEngage™. Work with [NumlyEngage™ support team](mailto:numlyengage-support@numly.io) to add the users in the NumlyEngage™ platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you select the NumlyEngage™ tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the NumlyEngage™ for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

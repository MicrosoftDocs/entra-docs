1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure insuite SSO](#configure-insuite-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create insuite test user](#create-insuite-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in insuite that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.

## Configure insuite SSO

To configure single sign-on on **insuite** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [insuite support team](mailto:e-support@dreamarts.co.jp). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create insuite test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in insuite. insuite supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in insuite, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you select the insuite tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the insuite for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

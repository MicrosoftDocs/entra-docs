# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra integration with Pingboard

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Pingboard with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Pingboard with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Pingboard.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Pingboard with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Pingboard single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* Pingboard supports **SP** and **IDP** initiated SSO.

* Pingboard supports [Automated user provisioning](./pingboard-provisioning-tutorial.md). 

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add Pingboard from the gallery

To configure the integration of Pingboard into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Pingboard from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Pingboard** in the search box.
1. Select **Pingboard** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Pingboard

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Pingboard using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Pingboard.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Pingboard, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Pingboard SSO](#configure-pingboard-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Pingboard test user](#create-pingboard-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Pingboard that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

6. The file is validated, and if everything is correct, single sign-on will now be enabled.

### Create Pingboard test user

The objective of this section is to create a user called Britta Simon in Pingboard. Pingboard supports automatic user provisioning, which is by default enabled. You can find more details [here](pingboard-provisioning-tutorial.md) on how to configure automatic user provisioning.

**If you need to create user manually, perform following steps:**

1. Sign in to your Pingboard company site as an administrator.

2. Click **“Add Employee”** button on **Directory** page.

    ![Add Employee](./media/pingboard-tutorial/test-user.png)

3. On the **“Add Employee”** dialog page, perform the following steps:

	![Invite People](./media/pingboard-tutorial/create-name.png)

4. A confirmation screen comes up to confirm the addition of user.

	![confirm](./media/pingboard-tutorial/confirm-user.png)

	> [!NOTE]
    > The Microsoft Entra account holder receives an email and follows a link to confirm their account before it becomes active.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Pingboard Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Pingboard Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Pingboard for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the Pingboard tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Pingboard for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure Pingboard you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

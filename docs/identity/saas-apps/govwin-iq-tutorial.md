# Microsoft Entra SSO integration with GovWin IQ

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate GovWin IQ with Microsoft Entra ID. GovWin IQ by Deltek is the industry-leading platform providing the most comprehensive market intelligence for U.S. federal, state and local, and Canadian governments. When you integrate GovWin IQ with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to GovWin IQ.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to GovWin IQ with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Microsoft Entra ID with GovWin IQ, you need:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* An active GovWin IQ Subscription. Single sign-on can be enabled at no cost. Make sure your Customer Success Manager has enabled a user at your organization as a SAML SSO Admin to perform the following steps.
* All users must have same email address in Azure as provisioned in GovWin IQ.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* GovWin IQ supports only **SP** initiated SSO.

> [!NOTE] 
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Adding GovWin IQ from the gallery

To configure the integration of GovWin IQ into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add GovWin IQ from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **GovWin IQ** in the search box.
1. Select **GovWin IQ** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

* Click on **Test this application** in Microsoft Entra admin center. This will redirect to GovWin IQ Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow.

* Go to GovWin IQ Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the GovWin IQ tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to GovWin IQ Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next Steps

Add all remaining users to the Microsoft Entra ID GovWin IQ app to enable SSO access. Once you configure GovWin IQ you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization's sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

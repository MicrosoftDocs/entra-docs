## Configure Bitly SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Bitly** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [Bitly support team](mailto:sso@bit.ly). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Bitly test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in Bitly. Bitly supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Bitly, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to Bitly Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Bitly Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Bitly for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the Bitly tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Bitly for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

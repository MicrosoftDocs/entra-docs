# Microsoft Entra SSO integration with Fullstory SAML

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Fullstory SAML with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Fullstory SAML with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Fullstory SAML.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Fullstory SAML with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Microsoft Entra ID with Fullstory SAML, you need:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Fullstory SAML single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Fullstory SAML supports only **SP** initiated SSO.
* Fullstory SAML supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Add Fullstory SAML from the gallery

To configure the integration of Fullstory SAML into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Fullstory SAML from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Fullstory SAML** in the search box.
1. Select **Fullstory SAML** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Fullstory SAML

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Fullstory SAML using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Fullstory SAML.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Fullstory SAML, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-microsoft-entra-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-a-microsoft-entra-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-microsoft-entra-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Fullstory SAML SSO](#configure-fullstory-saml-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Fullstory SAML test user](#create-fullstory-saml-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Fullstory SAML that is linked to the Microsoft Entra ID representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO in the Microsoft Entra admin center.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).

For more information, please refer [this](https://help.fullstory.com/hc/articles/360020623014-How-do-I-configure-SSO) document.

### Create Fullstory SAML test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in Fullstory SAML. Fullstory SAML supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Fullstory SAML, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.
 
* Click on **Test this application** in Microsoft Entra admin center. This will redirect to Fullstory SAML Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow.
 
* Go to Fullstory SAML Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.
 
* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Fullstory SAML tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Fullstory SAML Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure Fullstory SAML you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization's sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

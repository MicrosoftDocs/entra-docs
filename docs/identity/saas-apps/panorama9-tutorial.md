# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra integration with Panorama9

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Panorama9 with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Panorama9 with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Panorama9.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Panorama9 with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Panorama9 single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* Panorama9 supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Add Panorama9 from the gallery

To configure the integration of Panorama9 into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Panorama9 from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Panorama9** in the search box.
1. Select **Panorama9** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

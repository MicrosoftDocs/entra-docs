# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with Cisco Webex

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Cisco Webex with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Cisco Webex with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Cisco Webex.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Cisco Webex with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Cisco Webex single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.
*  Service Provider Metadata file from Cisco Webex.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Cisco Webex supports **SP** initiated SSO.
* Cisco Webex supports [**Automated user provisioning**](./cisco-webex-provisioning-tutorial.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Adding Cisco Webex from the gallery

To configure the integration of Cisco Webex into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Cisco Webex from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Cisco Webex** in the search box.
1. Select **Cisco Webex** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Cisco Webex

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Cisco Webex using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Cisco Webex.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Cisco Webex, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** to enable your users to use this feature.
	1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
	1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
2. **[Configure Cisco Webex SSO](#configure-cisco-webex-sso)** to configure the SSO settings on application side.
	1. **[Create Cisco Webex test user](#create-cisco-webex-test-user)** to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Cisco Webex that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
3. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **Cisco Webex** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, upload the downloaded **Service Provider metadata** file and configure the application by performing the following steps:

	>[!Note]
	>You will get the Service Provider Metadata file from the **Configure Cisco Webex** section, which is explained later in the tutorial. 

	a. Click **Upload metadata file**.

	b. Click on **folder logo** to select the metadata file and click **Upload**.

	c. After successful completion of uploading Service Provider metadata file the **Identifier** and **Reply URL** values get auto populated in **Basic SAML Configuration** section:

	d. In the **Sign on URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
	`https://web.ciscospark.com/idb/Consumer/metaAlias/<ID>/sp`
	
	> [!NOTE]
	> This value is not real. Copy the literal Reply URL value and add this value to the `https://web.ciscospark.com/` to formulate the actual Sign on URL value.

1. Cisco Webex application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![image](common/default-attributes.png)

1. In addition to above, Cisco Webex application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.
  
	| Name |  Source Attribute|
	| ---------------|--------- |
	| uid | user.userprincipalname |

	> [!NOTE]
	>  The source attribute value is by default mapped to userpricipalname. This can be changed to user.mail or user.onpremiseuserprincipalname or any other value as per the setting in Webex.


1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Cisco Webex Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Cisco Webex Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Cisco Webex tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Cisco Webex Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).


## Next steps

Once you configure Cisco Webex you can enforce Session Control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session Control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

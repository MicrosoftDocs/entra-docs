# Configure Cisco Webex for Single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID

In this article,  you learn how to integrate Cisco Webex with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Cisco Webex with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Cisco Webex.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Cisco Webex with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

[!INCLUDE [common-prerequisites.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/common-prerequisites.md)]
* Cisco Webex single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.
*  Service Provider Metadata file from Cisco Webex.

## Scenario description

In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Cisco Webex supports **SP** initiated SSO.
* Cisco Webex supports [**Automated user provisioning**](./cisco-webex-provisioning-tutorial.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Adding Cisco Webex from the gallery

To configure the integration of Cisco Webex into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Cisco Webex from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Cisco Webex** in the search box.
1. Select **Cisco Webex** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Cisco Webex

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Cisco Webex using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Cisco Webex.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Cisco Webex, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** to enable your users to use this feature.
	1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
	1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
2. **[Configure Cisco Webex SSO](#configure-cisco-webex-sso)** to configure the SSO settings on application side.
	1. **[Create Cisco Webex test user](#create-cisco-webex-test-user)** to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Cisco Webex that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
3. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **Cisco Webex** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, upload the downloaded **Service Provider metadata** file and configure the application by performing the following steps:

	>[!Note]
	>You get the Service Provider Metadata file from the **Configure Cisco Webex** section, which is explained later in the article. 

	a. Select **Upload metadata file**.

	b. Select **folder logo** to select the metadata file and select **Upload**.

	c. After successful completion of uploading Service Provider metadata file the **Identifier** and **Reply URL** values get auto populated in **Basic SAML Configuration** section:

	d. In the **Sign on URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
	`https://web.ciscospark.com/idb/Consumer/metaAlias/<ID>/sp`
	
	> [!NOTE]
	> This value isn't real. Copy the literal Reply URL value and add this value to the `https://web.ciscospark.com/` to formulate the actual Sign on URL value.

1. Cisco Webex application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![image](common/default-attributes.png)

1. In addition to above, Cisco Webex application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.
  
	| Name |  Source Attribute|
	| ---------------|--------- |
	| uid | user.userprincipalname |

	> [!NOTE]
	>  The source attribute value is by default mapped to userprincipalname. This can be changed to user.mail or user.onpremiseuserprincipalname or any other value as per the setting in Webex.


1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

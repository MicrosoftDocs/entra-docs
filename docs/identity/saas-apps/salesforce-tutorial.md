* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Salesforce.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Salesforce with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

[!INCLUDE [common-prerequisites.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/common-prerequisites.md)]
- Salesforce single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this article, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Salesforce supports **SP** initiated SSO.

* Salesforce supports [**Automated** user provisioning and deprovisioning](salesforce-provisioning-tutorial.md) (recommended).

* Salesforce supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

* Salesforce Mobile application can now be configured with Microsoft Entra ID for enabling SSO. In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

## Add Salesforce from the gallery

To configure the integration of Salesforce into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Salesforce from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Salesforce** in the search box.
1. Select **Salesforce** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Salesforce

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Salesforce using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Salesforce.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Salesforce, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    * **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    * **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Salesforce SSO](#configure-salesforce-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    * **[Create Salesforce test user](#create-salesforce-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Salesforce that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

1. On the **SAML Single Sign-On Settings** page, fields populate automatically, if you want to use SAML JIT, select the **User Provisioning Enabled** and select **SAML Identity Type** as **Assertion contains the Federation ID from the User object** otherwise, unselect the **User Provisioning Enabled** and select **SAML Identity Type** as **Assertion contains the User's Salesforce username**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you configured SAML JIT, you must complete an additional step in the **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** section. The Salesforce application expects specific SAML assertions, which requires you to have specific attributes in your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of required attributes by Salesforce.
    
    ![Screenshot that shows the JIT required attributes pane.](./media/salesforce-tutorial/just-in-time-attributes-required.png)
    
    If you still have issues with getting users provisioned with SAML JIT, see [Just-in-time provisioning requirements and SAML assertion fields](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.sso_jit_requirements.htm&type=5). Generally, when JIT fails, you might see an error like `We can't log you in because of an issue with single sign-on. Contact your Salesforce admin for help.`

If you donâ€™t want it to happen, then you should **leave all other authentication services unchecked**.

### Create Salesforce test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in Salesforce. Salesforce supports just-in-time provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Salesforce, a new one is created when you attempt to access Salesforce. Salesforce also supports automatic user provisioning, you can find more details [here](salesforce-provisioning-tutorial.md) on how to configure automatic user provisioning.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to Salesforce Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Salesforce Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the Salesforce tile in the My Apps portal, you should be automatically signed in to the Salesforce for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps portal, see [Introduction to the My Apps portal](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Test SSO for Salesforce (Mobile)

## Prevent application access through local accounts
Once you've validated that SSO works and rolled it out in your organization, disable application access using [local credentials](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.sso_enforce_sso_login.htm&type=5). This ensures that your Conditional Access policies, MFA, etc. is in place to protect sign-ins to Salesforce.

# Configure eLuminate for Single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID

In this article,  you learn how to integrate eLuminate with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate eLuminate with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to eLuminate.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to eLuminate with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* eLuminate single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.
* Along with Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator can also add or manage applications in Microsoft Entra ID.
For more information, see [Azure built-in roles](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md).

## Scenario description

In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* eLuminate supports **SP** initiated SSO.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add eLuminate from the gallery

To configure the integration of eLuminate into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add eLuminate from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **eLuminate** in the search box.
1. Select **eLuminate** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure eLuminate SSO](#configure-eluminate-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create eLuminate test user](#create-eluminate-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in eLuminate that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure eLuminate SSO

To configure single sign-on on **eLuminate** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [eLuminate support team](mailto:support@intellimedia.ca). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create eLuminate test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in eLuminate. Work with [eLuminate support team](mailto:support@intellimedia.ca) to add the users in the eLuminate platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to eLuminate Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to eLuminate Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the eLuminate tile in the My Apps, this option redirects to eLuminate Sign-on URL. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

Once you configure eLuminate you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

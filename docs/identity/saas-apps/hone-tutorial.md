1. **[Configure Hone SSO](#configure-hone-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Hone test user](#create-hone-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Hone that's linked to the Microsoft Entra ID representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Hone SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Hone** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from Microsoft Entra admin center to [Hone support team](mailto:support@honehq.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Hone test user

In this section, you create a user called B.Simon in Hone. Work with [Hone support team](mailto:support@honehq.com) to add the users in the Hone platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.
 
#### SP initiated:
 
* Select **Test this application** in Microsoft Entra admin center. this option redirects to Hone Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  
 
* Go to Hone Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.
 
#### IDP initiated:
 
* Select **Test this application** in Microsoft Entra admin center and you should be automatically signed in to the Hone for which you set up the SSO.
 
You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the Hone tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign-on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Hone for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

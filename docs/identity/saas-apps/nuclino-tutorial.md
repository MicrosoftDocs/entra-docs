To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Nuclino, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Nuclino SSO](#configure-nuclino-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Nuclino test user](#create-nuclino-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Nuclino that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **Nuclino** > **Single sign-on**.

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://api.nuclino.com/api/sso/<UNIQUE-ID>/metadata`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://api.nuclino.com/api/sso/<UNIQUE-ID>/acs`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values aren't real. Update these values with the actual Identifier and Reply URL from the **Authentication** section, which is explained later in this article.

1. Select **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:

	| Name |  Source Attribute|
	| ---------------| --------- |
	| first_name | user.givenname |
	| last_name | user.surname |

### Create Nuclino test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in Nuclino. Nuclino supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Nuclino, a new one is created after authentication.

> [!Note]
> If you need to create a user manually, contact [Nuclino support team](mailto:contact@nuclino.com).

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to Nuclino Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Nuclino Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Nuclino for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the Nuclino tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Nuclino for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

# Customer intent: As an IT administrator, I want to learn how to configure single sign-on between Microsoft Entra ID and LambdaTest Single Sign on so that I can control who has access to LambdaTest Single Sign on, enable automatic sign-in with Microsoft Entra accounts, and manage my accounts in one central location.

# Microsoft Entra SSO integration with LambdaTest Single Sign on

In this article, you learn how to integrate LambdaTest Single Sign on with Microsoft Entra ID. LambdaTest's Single Sign-on application enables you to self-configure SSO with your Microsoft Entra instance. When you integrate LambdaTest Single Sign on with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to LambdaTest Single Sign on.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to LambdaTest Single Sign on with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

You configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on for LambdaTest Single Sign on in a test environment. LambdaTest Single Sign on supports both **SP** and **IDP** initiated single sign-on and **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Microsoft Entra ID with LambdaTest Single Sign on, you need:

* A Microsoft Entra user account. If you don't already have one, you can [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* One of the following roles: Global Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator, or owner of the service principal.
* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* LambdaTest Single Sign on single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Add application and assign a test user

Before you begin the process of configuring single sign-on, you need to add the LambdaTest Single Sign on application from the Microsoft Entra gallery. You need a test user account to assign to the application and test the single sign-on configuration.

### Add LambdaTest Single Sign on from the Microsoft Entra gallery

Add LambdaTest Single Sign on from the Microsoft Entra application gallery to configure single sign-on with LambdaTest Single Sign on. For more information on how to add application from the gallery, see the [Quickstart: Add application from the gallery](~/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal.md).

### Create and assign Microsoft Entra test user

Follow the guidelines in the [create and assign a user account](~/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal-assign-users.md) article to create a test user account called B.Simon.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, and assign roles. The wizard also provides a link to the single sign-on configuration pane.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Complete the following steps to enable Microsoft Entra single sign-on.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **LambdaTest Single Sign on** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Screenshot shows how to edit Basic SAML Configuration.](common/edit-urls.png "Basic Configuration")

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** textbox, type a value using the following pattern:
    `urn:auth0:lambdatest:<CustomerName>`

    b. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://lambdatest.auth0.com/login/callback?connection=<CustomerName>`

1. If you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode, then perform the following step:

    In the **Sign on URL** textbox, type the URL:
    `https://accounts.lambdatest.com/auth0/login`

    > [!NOTE]
    > These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier and Reply URL. Contact [LambdaTest Single Sign on Client support team](mailto:support@lambdatest.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, find **Certificate (Base64)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

    ![Screenshot shows the Certificate download link.](common/certificatebase64.png "Certificate")

1. On the **Set up LambdaTest Single Sign on** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

	![Screenshot shows to copy configuration appropriate URL.](common/copy-configuration-urls.png "Metadata")

## Configure LambdaTest Single Sign on SSO

To configure single sign-on on **LambdaTest Single Sign on** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [LambdaTest Single Sign on support team](mailto:support@lambdatest.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create LambdaTest Single Sign on test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in LambdaTest Single Sign on. LambdaTest Single Sign on supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in LambdaTest Single Sign on, a new one is commonly created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to LambdaTest Single Sign on Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to LambdaTest Single Sign on Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the LambdaTest Single Sign on for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the LambdaTest Single Sign on tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign-on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the LambdaTest Single Sign on for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

## Next steps

Once you configure LambdaTest Single Sign on you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

## Configure CBRE ServiceInsight SSO

To configure single sign-on on **CBRE ServiceInsight** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [CBRE ServiceInsight support team](mailto:SISupport@cbre.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create CBRE ServiceInsight test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in CBRE ServiceInsight. CBRE ServiceInsight supports just-in-time provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in CBRE ServiceInsight, a new one is created when you attempt to access CBRE ServiceInsight.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to CBRE ServiceInsight Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to CBRE ServiceInsight Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the CBRE ServiceInsight tile in the My Apps, this option redirects to CBRE ServiceInsight Sign-on URL. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

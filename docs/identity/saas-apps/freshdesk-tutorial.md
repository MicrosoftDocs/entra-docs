1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with Britta Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable Britta Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Freshdesk SSO](#configure-freshdesk-sso)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
    - **[Create Freshdesk test user](#create-freshdesk-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Freshdesk that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **Freshdesk** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set-up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, enter the values for the following fields:

    1. In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<tenant-name>.freshdesk.com` or any other value Freshdesk has suggested.

    1. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<tenant-name>.freshdesk.com` or any other value Freshdesk has suggested.
     
    1. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<tenant-name>.freshdesk.com/login/saml`

    > [!NOTE]
    > These values aren't real. Update these values with the actual Sign on URL, Identifier and Reply URL. Contact [Freshdesk Client support team](https://freshdesk.com/helpdesk-software?utm_source=Google-AdWords&utm_medium=Search-IND-Brand&utm_campaign=Search-IND-Brand&utm_term=freshdesk&device=c&gclid=COSH2_LH7NICFVUDvAodBPgBZg) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section.

1. Freshdesk application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes, whereas **Unique User Identifier** is mapped with **user.userprincipalname** but Freshdesk expects this claim to be mapped with **user.mail**, so you need to edit the attribute mapping by selecting Edit icon and change the attribute mapping.

    select **save**.

1. Select **Set additional URLs** and perform the following steps if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

## Configure Nature Research SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Nature Research** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [Nature Research support team](mailto:onlineservice@springernature.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to Nature Research Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Nature Research Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Nature Research for which you set up the SSO 

You can also use Microsoft Access Panel to test the application in any mode. When you select the Nature Research tile in the Access Panel, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Nature Research for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

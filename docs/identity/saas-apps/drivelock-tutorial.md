# Configure DriveLock for Single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID

In this article,  you learn how to integrate DriveLock with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate DriveLock with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to DriveLock.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to DriveLock with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Microsoft Entra ID with DriveLock, you need:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* DriveLock single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.







## Add DriveLock from the gallery

To configure the integration of DriveLock into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add DriveLock from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **DriveLock** in the search box.
1. Select **DriveLock** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

1. DriveLock application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

1. In addition to above, DriveLock application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response, which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.
	
	| Name | Namespace  |  Source Attribute|
	| ---------------| --------------- | --------- |
	| [Attb1] | [Namespace1] | [value1] |
	| [Attb2] | [Namespace2] | [value2] |
	| [Attb3] | [Namespace3] | [value3] |
	| [Attb4] | [Namespace4] | [value4] |

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, select copy button to copy **App Federation Metadata Url** and save it on your computer.

### Create a Microsoft Entra ID test user

In this section, you create a test user in the Microsoft Entra admin center called B.Simon.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [User Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#user-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Users**.
1. Select **New user** > **Create new user**, at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Display name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User principal name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Select **Review + create**.
1. Select **Create**.

### Assign the Microsoft Entra ID test user

In this section, you enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on by granting access to DriveLock.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **DriveLock**.
1. In the app's overview page, select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user/group**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Added Assignment** dialog.
   1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then select the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
   1. If you're expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
   1. In the **Added Assignment** dialog, select the **Assign** button.

## Configure DriveLock SSO

To configure single sign-on on **DriveLock** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [DriveLock support team](mailto:Cloud.opsmgmt@drivelock.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create DriveLock test user

In this section, you create a user called B.Simon in DriveLock. Work withÂ [DriveLock support team](mailto:Cloud.opsmgmt@drivelock.com) to add the users in the DriveLock platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration using the My Apps.

When you select the DriveLock tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the DriveLock for which you set up SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

Once you configure DriveLock you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization's sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with N2F - Expense reports

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate N2F - Expense reports with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate N2F - Expense reports with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to N2F - Expense reports.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to N2F - Expense reports with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* N2F - Expense reports single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* N2F - Expense reports supports **SP** and **IDP** initiated SSO.

## Add N2F - Expense reports from the gallery

To configure the integration of N2F - Expense reports into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add N2F - Expense reports from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **N2F - Expense reports** in the search box.
1. Select **N2F - Expense reports** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for N2F - Expense reports

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with N2F - Expense reports using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in N2F - Expense reports.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with N2F - Expense reports, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure N2F - Expense reports SSO](#configure-n2f---expense-reports-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create N2F - Expense reports test user](#create-n2f---expense-reports-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in N2F - Expense reports that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to N2F - Expense reports Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to N2F - Expense reports Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the N2F - Expense reports for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the N2F - Expense reports tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the N2F - Expense reports for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

## Next steps

Once you configure N2F - Expense reports you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

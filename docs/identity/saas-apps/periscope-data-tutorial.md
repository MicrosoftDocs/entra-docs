# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with Periscope Data

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Periscope Data with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Periscope Data with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Periscope Data.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Periscope Data with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Periscope Data single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* Periscope Data supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Add Periscope Data from the gallery

To configure the integration of Periscope Data into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Periscope Data from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Periscope Data** in the search box.
1. Select **Periscope Data** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Periscope Data

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Periscope Data using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Periscope Data.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Periscope Data, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Periscope Data SSO](#configure-periscope-data-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Periscope Data test user](#create-periscope-data-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Periscope Data that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Periscope Data Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Periscope Data Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Periscope Data tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Periscope Data Sign-on URL. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

## Next steps

Once you configure Periscope Data you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

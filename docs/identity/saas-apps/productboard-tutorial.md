* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to productboard.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to productboard with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites
The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

[!INCLUDE [common-prerequisites.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/common-prerequisites.md)]
* productboard single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* productboard supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.
* productboard supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add productboard from the gallery

To configure the integration of productboard into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add productboard from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **productboard** in the search box.
1. Select **productboard** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure productboard SSO
1. You need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [productboard support team](mailto:support@productboard.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create productboard test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in productboard. productboard supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in productboard, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to productboard Sign-on URL where you can initiate the sign-in flow.  

* Go to productboard Sign-on URL directly and initiate the sign-in flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the productboard for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the productboard tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign-in page for initiating the sign-in flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the productboard for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

# Tutorial: Configure IDEO for automatic user provisioning

The objective of this tutorial is to demonstrate the steps to be performed in IDEO and Microsoft Entra ID to configure Microsoft Entra ID to automatically provision and de-provision users and/or groups to IDEO. For important details on what this service does, how it works, and frequently asked questions, see [Automate user provisioning and deprovisioning to SaaS applications with Microsoft Entra ID](~/identity/app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md).

## Capabilities supported
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create users in IDEO
> * Remove users in IDEO when they do not require access anymore
> * Keep user attributes synchronized between Microsoft Entra ID and IDEO
> * Provision groups and group memberships in IDEO
> * Single sign-on to IDEO (recommended)

## Prerequisites

The scenario outlined in this tutorial assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

* [A Microsoft Entra tenant](~/identity-platform/quickstart-create-new-tenant.md).
* A user account in Microsoft Entra ID with [permission](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md) to configure provisioning (like [Application Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#application-administrator), [Cloud Application Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#cloud-application-administrator), or [Application Owner](/entra/fundamentals/users-default-permissions#owned-enterprise-applications)).
* [A IDEO tenant](https://www.saasworthy.com/product/shape-space/pricing)
* A user account on IDEO | Shape with Admin permissions.


## Step 1: Plan your provisioning deployment
1. Learn about [how the provisioning service works](~/identity/app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md).
2. Determine who will be in [scope for provisioning](~/identity/app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).
3. Determine what data to [map between Microsoft Entra ID and IDEO](~/identity/app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes.md).

## Step 2: Configure IDEO to support provisioning with Microsoft Entra ID

Before configuring IDEO for automatic user provisioning with Microsoft Entra ID, you will need to retrieve some provisioning information from IDEO.

* For **Secret Token** contact IDEO support team at productsupport@ideo.com. This value will be entered in the **Secret Token** field in the Provisioning tab of your IDEO application.

## Step 3: Add IDEO from the Microsoft Entra application gallery

Add IDEO from the Microsoft Entra application gallery to start managing provisioning to IDEO. If you have previously setup IDEO for SSO you can use the same application. However it is recommended that you create a separate app when testing out the integration initially. Learn more about adding an application from the gallery [here](~/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal.md).

## Step 4: Define who will be in scope for provisioning 

The Microsoft Entra provisioning service allows you to scope who will be provisioned based on assignment to the application and or based on attributes of the user / group. If you choose to scope who will be provisioned to your app based on assignment, you can use the following [steps](~/identity/enterprise-apps/assign-user-or-group-access-portal.md) to assign users and groups to the application. If you choose to scope who will be provisioned based solely on attributes of the user or group, you can use a scoping filter as described [here](~/identity/app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md). 

* Start small. Test with a small set of users and groups before rolling out to everyone. When scope for provisioning is set to assigned users and groups, you can control this by assigning one or two users or groups to the app. When scope is set to all users and groups, you can specify an [attribute based scoping filter](~/identity/app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).

* If you need additional roles, you can [update the application manifest](~/identity-platform/howto-add-app-roles-in-apps.md) to add new roles.


## Step 5: Configure automatic user provisioning to IDEO 

This section guides you through the steps to configure the Microsoft Entra provisioning service to create, update, and disable users and/or groups in IDEO based on user and/or group assignments in Microsoft Entra ID.

### To configure automatic user provisioning for IDEO in Microsoft Entra ID:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications**

	![Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

1. In the applications list, select **IDEO**.

	![The IDEO link in the Applications list](common/all-applications.png)

3. Select the **Provisioning** tab.

4. Set the **Provisioning Mode** to **Automatic**.

	![Screenshot of the Provisioning Mode dropdown list with the Automatic option called out.](common/provisioning-automatic.png)

5. Under the **Admin Credentials** section, input the **SCIM 2.0 base URL and Access Token** values retrieved earlier from the IDEO support team in the **Tenant URL** and **Secret Token** fields respectively. Click **Test Connection** to ensure Microsoft Entra ID can connect to IDEO. If the connection fails, ensure your IDEO account has Admin permissions and try again.

	![Tenant URL + Token](common/provisioning-testconnection-tenanturltoken.png)

6. In the **Notification Email** field, enter the email address of a person or group who should receive the provisioning error notifications and check the checkbox - **Send an email notification when a failure occurs**.

	![Notification Email](common/provisioning-notification-email.png)

7. Click **Save**.

8. Under the **Mappings** section, select **Synchronize Microsoft Entra users to IDEO**.

9. Review the user attributes that are synchronized from Microsoft Entra ID to IDEO in the **Attribute Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the user accounts in IDEO for update operations. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.

   |Attribute|Type|
   |---|---|
   |userName|String|
   |emails[type eq "work"].value|String|
   |active|Boolean|
   |name.givenName|String|
   |name.familyName|String|

10. Under the **Mappings** section, select **Synchronize Microsoft Entra groups to IDEO**.
   
11. Review the group attributes that are synchronized from Microsoft Entra ID to ideo in the **Attribute-Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the groups in IDEO for update operations. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.

      |Attribute|Type|
      |---|---|
      |displayName|String|
      |members|Reference|

12. To configure scoping filters, refer to the following instructions provided in the [Scoping filter tutorial](~/identity/app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).

13. To enable the Microsoft Entra provisioning service for IDEO, change the **Provisioning Status** to **On** in the **Settings** section.

	![Provisioning Status Toggled On](common/provisioning-toggle-on.png)

14. Define the users and/or groups that you would like to provision to IDEO by choosing the desired values in **Scope** in the **Settings** section.

	![Provisioning Scope](common/provisioning-scope.png)

15. When you are ready to provision, click **Save**.

	![Saving Provisioning Configuration](common/provisioning-configuration-save.png)

This operation starts the initial synchronization of all users and/or groups defined in **Scope** in the **Settings** section. The initial sync takes longer to perform than subsequent syncs, which occur approximately every 40 minutes as long as the Microsoft Entra provisioning service is running. 

## Step 6: Monitor your deployment
Once you've configured provisioning, use the following resources to monitor your deployment:

1. Use the [provisioning logs](~/identity/monitoring-health/concept-provisioning-logs.md) to determine which users have been provisioned successfully or unsuccessfully
2. Check the [progress bar](~/identity/app-provisioning/application-provisioning-when-will-provisioning-finish-specific-user.md) to see the status of the provisioning cycle and how close it is to completion
3. If the provisioning configuration seems to be in an unhealthy state, the application will go into quarantine. Learn more about quarantine states [here](~/identity/app-provisioning/application-provisioning-quarantine-status.md).

### Create TimeLive test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in TimeLive. TimeLive supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in TimeLive, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to TimeLive Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to TimeLive Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the TimeLive tile in the My Apps, this option redirects to TimeLive Sign-on URL. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

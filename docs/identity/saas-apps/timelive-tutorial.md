# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with TimeLive

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate TimeLive with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate TimeLive with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to TimeLive.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to TimeLive with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* TimeLive single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* TimeLive supports **SP** initiated SSO.

* TimeLive supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Add TimeLive from the gallery

To configure the integration of TimeLive into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add TimeLive from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **TimeLive** in the search box.
1. Select **TimeLive** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for TimeLive

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with TimeLive using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in TimeLive.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with TimeLive, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure TimeLive SSO](#configure-timelive-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create TimeLive test user](#create-timelive-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in TimeLive that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Create TimeLive test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in TimeLive. TimeLive supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in TimeLive, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to TimeLive Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to TimeLive Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the TimeLive tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to TimeLive Sign-on URL. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

## Next steps

Once you configure TimeLive you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

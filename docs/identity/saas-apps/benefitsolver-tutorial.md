# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with Benefitsolver

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Benefitsolver with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Benefitsolver with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Benefitsolver with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Benefitsolver single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* Benefitsolver supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Add Benefitsolver from the gallery

To configure the integration of Benefitsolver into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Benefitsolver from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).

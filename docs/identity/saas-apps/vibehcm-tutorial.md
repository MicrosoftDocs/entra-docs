1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode the user doesn't have to perform any step as the app is already pre-integrated with Azure.

5. Select **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<companyName>.vibehcm.com/portal.jsp`

    > [!NOTE]
	> The value isn't real. Update the value with the actual Sign-on URL. Contact [Vibe HCM Client support team](mailto:support@vibehcm.com) to get the value. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section.

6. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, In the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, select copy button to copy **App Federation Metadata Url** and save it on your computer.

## Configure Vibe HCM SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Vibe HCM** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [Vibe HCM support team](mailto:support@vibehcm.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Vibe HCM test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Vibe HCM. Work with [Vibe HCM support team](mailto:support@vibehcm.com) to add the users in the Vibe HCM platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to Vibe HCM Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Vibe HCM Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Vibe HCM for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the Vibe HCM tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Vibe HCM for which you set up the SSO.

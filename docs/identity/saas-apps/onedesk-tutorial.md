## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for OneDesk

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with OneDesk using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in OneDesk.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with OneDesk, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure OneDesk SSO](#configure-onedesk-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create OneDesk test user](#create-onedesk-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in OneDesk that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Create OneDesk test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in OneDesk. OneDesk supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in OneDesk, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to OneDesk Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to OneDesk Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the OneDesk for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the OneDesk tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the OneDesk for which you set up the SSO.

# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) integration with Zoom

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Zoom with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Zoom with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Zoom.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Zoom with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Zoom single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Zoom supports **SP** initiated SSO and 
* Zoom supports [**Automated** user provisioning](./zoom-provisioning-tutorial.md).

## Adding Zoom from the gallery

To configure the integration of Zoom into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Zoom from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Zoom** in the search box.
1. Select **Zoom** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Zoom

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Zoom using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Zoom.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Zoom, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
	1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
	1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
2. **[Configure Zoom SSO](#configure-zoom-sso)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
	1. **[Create Zoom test user](#create-zoom-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Zoom that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
3. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

> [!NOTE]
> To learn how to configure Role in Microsoft Entra ID, see [Configure the role claim issued in the SAML token for enterprise applications](~/identity-platform/enterprise-app-role-management.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Zoom might expect a group claim in the SAML payload. If you have created any groups, contact the [Zoom Client support team](https://support.zoom.us/hc/) with the group information so they can configure the group information on their end. You also need to provide the Object ID to [Zoom Client support team](https://support.zoom.us/hc/) so they can configure the Object ID on their end. To get the Object ID, see [Configuring Zoom with Azure](https://support.zoom.us/hc/articles/115005887566).

### Create Zoom test user

The objective of this section is to create a user called B.Simon in Zoom. Zoom supports automatic user provisioning, which is by default enabled. You can find more details [here](./zoom-provisioning-tutorial.md) on how to configure automatic user provisioning.

> [!NOTE]
> If you need to create a user manually, you need to contact [Zoom Client support team](https://support.zoom.us/hc/)

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Zoom Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow.

* Go to Zoom Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Zoom tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Zoom Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure Microsoft Entra Zoom you can enforce Session Control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session Control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra integration with Sauce Labs - Mobile and Web Testing

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Sauce Labs - Mobile and Web Testing with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Sauce Labs - Mobile and Web Testing with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Sauce Labs - Mobile and Web Testing.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Sauce Labs - Mobile and Web Testing with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To configure Microsoft Entra integration with Sauce Labs - Mobile and Web Testing, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a Microsoft Entra environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Sauce Labs - Mobile and Web Testing single sign-on enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* Sauce Labs - Mobile and Web Testing supports **IDP** initiated SSO.
* Sauce Labs - Mobile and Web Testing supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Add Sauce Labs - Mobile and Web Testing from the gallery

To configure the integration of Sauce Labs - Mobile and Web Testing into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Sauce Labs - Mobile and Web Testing from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).

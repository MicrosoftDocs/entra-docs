# Microsoft Entra SSO integration with gulfHR SSO

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate gulfHR SSO with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate gulfHR SSO with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to gulfHR SSO.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to gulfHR SSO with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Microsoft Entra ID with gulfHR SSO, you need:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* gulfHR SSO single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* gulfHR SSO supports only **IDP** initiated SSO.

## Add gulfHR SSO from the gallery

To configure the integration of gulfHR SSO into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add gulfHR SSO from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **gulfHR SSO** in the search box.
1. Select **gulfHR SSO** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for gulfHR SSO

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with gulfHR SSO using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in gulfHR SSO.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with gulfHR SSO, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-microsoft-entra-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-a-microsoft-entra-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-microsoft-entra-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure gulfHR SSO](#configure-gulfhr-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create gulfHR SSO test user](#create-gulfhr-sso-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in gulfHR SSO that is linked to the Microsoft Entra ID representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO in the Microsoft Entra admin center.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).

## Configure gulfHR SSO

To configure single sign-on on **gulfHR SSO** side, you need to send the **Thumbprint Value** and appropriate copied URLs from Microsoft Entra admin center to [gulfHR SSO support team](mailto:helpdesk@gulfhr.ae). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create gulfHR SSO test user

In this section, you create a user called B.Simon in gulfHR SSO. Work withÂ [gulfHR SSO support team](mailto:helpdesk@gulfhr.ae) to add the users in the gulfHR SSO platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.
 
* Click on Test this application in Microsoft Entra admin center and you should be automatically signed in to the gulfHR SSO for which you set up the SSO.
 
* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the gulfHR SSO tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the gulfHR SSO for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure gulfHR SSO you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization's sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

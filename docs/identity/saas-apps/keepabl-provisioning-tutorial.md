# Configure Keepabl for automatic user provisioning with Microsoft Entra ID

This article describes the steps you need to perform in both Keepabl and Microsoft Entra ID to configure automatic user provisioning. When configured, Microsoft Entra ID automatically provisions and de-provisions users to [Keepabl](https://keepabl.com/) using the Microsoft Entra provisioning service. For important details on what this service does, how it works, and frequently asked questions, see [Automate user provisioning and deprovisioning to SaaS applications with Microsoft Entra ID](~/identity/app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md). 


## Capabilities supported
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create users in Keepabl.
> * Remove users in Keepabl when they don't require access anymore.
> * Keep user attributes synchronized between Microsoft Entra ID and Keepabl.
> * [Single sign-on](keepabl-tutorial.md) to Keepabl (recommended).

## Prerequisites

The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

* [A Microsoft Entra tenant](~/identity-platform/quickstart-create-new-tenant.md). 
* One of the following roles: [Application Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#application-administrator), [Cloud Application Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#cloud-application-administrator), or [Application Owner](/entra/fundamentals/users-default-permissions#owned-enterprise-applications). 
* A user account in Keepabl with Admin permissions.


## Step 1: Plan your provisioning deployment
1. Learn about [how the provisioning service works](~/identity/app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md).
1. Determine who's in [scope for provisioning](~/identity/app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).
1. Determine what data to [map between Microsoft Entra ID and Keepabl](~/identity/app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes.md).

## Step 2: Configure Keepabl to support provisioning with Microsoft Entra ID

1. Sign in to [Keepabl Admin Portal](https://app.keepabl.com) and then navigate to **Account Settings > Your Organization**, where youâ€™ll see the **Single Sign-On (SSO)** section.
1. Select the **Edit Identity Provider** button.You be taken to the SSO Setup page, where once you select Microsoft Azure as your provider and then scroll down, you see your **Tenant URL** and **Secret Token**. These value is entered in the Provisioning tab of your Keepabl application.

>To Setup Identity Provider or SSO visit [here](https://keepabl.com/admin-guide-to-sso-keepabl).

<a name='step-3-add-keepabl-from-the-azure-ad-application-gallery'></a>

## Step 3: Add Keepabl from the Microsoft Entra application gallery

Add Keepabl from the Microsoft Entra application gallery to start managing provisioning to Keepabl. If you have previously setup Keepabl for SSO, you can use the same application. However, we recommend that you create a separate app when testing out the integration initially. Learn more about adding an application from the gallery [here](~/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal.md). 

## Step 4: Define who is in scope for provisioning 

[!INCLUDE [create-assign-users-provisioning.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/create-assign-users-provisioning.md)]

## Step 5: Configure automatic user provisioning to Keepabl 

This section guides you through the steps to configure the Microsoft Entra provisioning service to create, update, and disable users in Keepabl based on user assignments in Microsoft Entra ID.

### To configure automatic user provisioning for Keepabl in Microsoft Entra ID:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps**

	![Screenshot of Enterprise applications blade.](common/enterprise-applications.png)

1. In the applications list, select **Keepabl**.

	![Screenshot of the Keepabl link in the Applications list.](common/all-applications.png)

1. Select the **Provisioning** tab.

	![Screenshot of Provisioning tab.](common/provisioning.png)

1. Set the **Provisioning Mode** to **Automatic**.

	![Screenshot of Provisioning tab automatic.](common/provisioning-automatic.png)

1. Under the **Admin Credentials** section, input your Keepabl Tenant URL and corresponding Secret Token. Select **Test Connection** to ensure Microsoft Entra ID can connect to Keepabl.

 	![Screenshot of Token.](common/provisioning-testconnection-tenanturltoken.png)

1. In the **Notification Email** field, enter the email address of a person who should receive the provisioning error notifications and select the **Send an email notification when a failure occurs** check box.

	![Screenshot of Notification Email.](common/provisioning-notification-email.png)

1. Select **Save**.

1. Under the **Mappings** section, select **Synchronize Microsoft Entra users to Keepabl**.

1. Review the user attributes that are synchronized from Microsoft Entra ID to Keepabl in the **Attribute-Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the user accounts in Keepabl for update operations. If you choose to change the [matching target attribute](~/identity/app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes.md), you need to ensure that the Keepabl API supports filtering users based on that attribute. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.

   |Attribute|Type|Supported for filtering|Required by Keepabl|
   |---|---|---|---|
   |userName|String|&check;|&check;
   |emails[type eq "work"].value|String|&check;|&check;
   |active|Boolean|||
   |name.givenName|String|||
   |name.familyName|String|||
	
1. To configure scoping filters, refer to the following instructions provided in the [Scoping filter  article](~/identity/app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).

1. To enable the Microsoft Entra provisioning service for Keepabl, change the **Provisioning Status** to **On** in the **Settings** section.

	![Screenshot of Provisioning Status Toggled On.](common/provisioning-toggle-on.png)

1. Define the users that you would like to provision to Keepabl by choosing the desired values in **Scope** in the **Settings** section.

	![Screenshot of Provisioning Scope.](common/provisioning-scope.png)

1. When you're ready to provision, select **Save**.

	![Screenshot of Saving Provisioning Configuration.](common/provisioning-configuration-save.png)

This operation starts the initial synchronization cycle of all users defined in **Scope** in the **Settings** section. The initial cycle takes longer to perform than subsequent cycles, which occur approximately every 40 minutes as long as the Microsoft Entra provisioning service is running.

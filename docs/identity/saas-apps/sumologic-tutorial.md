# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) integration with SumoLogic

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate SumoLogic with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate SumoLogic with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to SumoLogic.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to SumoLogic with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* SumoLogic single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* SumoLogic supports **IDP** initiated SSO.

## Add SumoLogic from the gallery

To configure the integration of SumoLogic into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add SumoLogic from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **SumoLogic** in the search box.
1. Select **SumoLogic** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for SumoLogic

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with SumoLogic using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in SumoLogic.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with SumoLogic, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure SumoLogic SSO](#configure-sumologic-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create SumoLogic test user](#create-sumologic-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in SumoLogic that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the SumoLogic for which you set up the SSO.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the SumoLogic tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the SumoLogic for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure SumoLogic you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

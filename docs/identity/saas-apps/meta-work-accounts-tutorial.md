# Configure Meta Work Accounts for Single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID

In this article,  you learn how to integrate Meta Work Accounts with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Meta Work Accounts with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Meta Work Accounts.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Meta Work Accounts with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites
The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

[!INCLUDE [common-prerequisites.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/common-prerequisites.md)]
* Meta Work Accounts single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Meta Work Accounts supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.

## Add Meta Work Accounts from the gallery

To configure the integration of Meta Work Accounts into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Meta Work Accounts from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Meta Work Accounts** in the search box.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.

### Create Meta Work Accounts test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Meta Work Accounts. Work with the [Work Accounts team](https://www.workplace.com/help/work) to add the users in the Meta Work Accounts platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to Meta Work Accounts Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Meta Work Accounts Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Meta Work Accounts for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the Meta Work Accounts tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Meta Work Accounts for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

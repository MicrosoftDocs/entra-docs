In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in SmartRecruiters. Work with [SmartRecruiters support team](https://www.smartrecruiters.com/about-us/contact-us/) to add the users in the SmartRecruiters platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to SmartRecruiters Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to SmartRecruiters Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the SmartRecruiters for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the SmartRecruiters tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the SmartRecruiters for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

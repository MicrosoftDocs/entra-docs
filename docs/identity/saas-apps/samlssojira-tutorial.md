### Create SAML SSO for Jira by resolution GmbH test user

To enable Microsoft Entra users to sign in to SAML SSO for Jira by resolution GmbH, they must be provisioned into SAML SSO for Jira by resolution GmbH. For the case of this tutorial, you have to do the provisioning by hand. However, there are also other provisioning models available for the SAML SSO plugin by resolution, for example **Just In Time** provisioning. Refer to their documentation at [SAML SSO by resolution GmbH](https://wiki.resolution.de/doc/saml-sso/latest/all). If you have a question about it, contact support at [resolution support](https://www.resolution.de/go/support).

**To manually provision a user account, perform the following steps:**

1. Sign in to Jira instance as an administrator.

2. Hover over the cog and select **User management**.

	d. In the **Password** textbox, enter the password of the user.

	e. Click **Create user** to finish the user creation.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to SAML SSO for Jira by resolution GmbH Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to SAML SSO for Jira by resolution GmbH Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the SAML SSO for Jira by resolution GmbH for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the SAML SSO for Jira by resolution GmbH tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the SAML SSO for Jira by resolution GmbH for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Enable SSO redirection for Jira

As noted in the section before, there are currently two ways to trigger the single sign-on. Either by using the **Azure portal** or using **a special link to your Jira instance**. The SAML SSO plugin by resolution GmbH also allows you to trigger single sign-on by simply **accessing any URL pointing to your Jira instance**.

In essence, all users accessing Jira will be redirected to the single sign-on after activating an option in the plugin.

To activate SSO redirect, do the following in **your Jira instance**:

1. Access the configuration page of the SAML SSO plugin in Jira.
1. Click on **Redirection** in the left panel.

   ![Partial screenshot of the Jira SAML SingleSignOn Plugin Configuration page highlighting the Redirection link in the left navigation.](./media/samlssojira-tutorial/configure-1.png)

1. Tick **Enable SSO Redirect**.

   ![Partial screenshot of the Jira SAML SingleSignOn Plugin Configuration page highlighting the selected "Enable SSO Redirect" check box.](./media/samlssojira-tutorial/configure-2.png) 

1. Press the **Save Settings** button in the top right corner.

After activating the option, you can still reach the username/password prompt if the **Enable nosso** option is ticked by navigating to `https://<server-base-url>/login.jsp?nosso`. As always, substitute **\<server-base-url>** with your base URL.

## Next steps

Once you configure SAML SSO for Jira by resolution GmbH you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

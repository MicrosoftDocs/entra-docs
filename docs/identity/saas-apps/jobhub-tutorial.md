# Configure JOBHUB for Single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID

In this article,  you learn how to integrate JOBHUB with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate JOBHUB with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to JOBHUB.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to JOBHUB with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Microsoft Entra ID, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID](~/identity/enterprise-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites
The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

[!INCLUDE [common-prerequisites.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/common-prerequisites.md)]
* JOBHUB single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment. JOBHUB supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Adding JOBHUB from the gallery

To configure the integration of JOBHUB into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add JOBHUB from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **JOBHUB** in the search box.
1. Select **JOBHUB** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with JOBHUB using a test user called **Britta Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in JOBHUB.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with JOBHUB, complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure JOBHUB SSO](#configure-jobhub-sso)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable Britta Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
5. **[Create JOBHUB test user](#create-jobhub-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in JOBHUB that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
6. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure JOBHUB SSO

To configure single sign-on on **JOBHUB** side, you need to send the **Thumbprint value** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [JOBHUB support team](mailto:platform@pasonagroup.co.jp). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create JOBHUB test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in JOBHUB. Work withÂ [JOBHUB support team](mailto:platform@pasonagroup.co.jp) to add the users in the JOBHUB platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

### Test SSO

When you select the JOBHUB tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the JOBHUB for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

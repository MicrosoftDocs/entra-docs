# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra integration with Palo Alto Networks Captive Portal

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Palo Alto Networks Captive Portal with Microsoft Entra ID.
Integrating Palo Alto Networks Captive Portal with Microsoft Entra ID provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Palo Alto Networks Captive Portal.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Palo Alto Networks Captive Portal (Single Sign-On) with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Microsoft Entra ID with Palo Alto Networks Captive Portal, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have Microsoft Entra ID, you can get a [one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).
* A Palo Alto Networks Captive Portal single sign-on (SSO)-enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* Palo Alto Networks Captive Portal supports **IDP** initiated SSO
* Palo Alto Networks Captive Portal supports **Just In Time** user provisioning

## Adding Palo Alto Networks Captive Portal from the gallery

To configure the integration of Palo Alto Networks Captive Portal into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Palo Alto Networks Captive Portal from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Palo Alto Networks Captive Portal** in the search box.
1. Select **Palo Alto Networks Captive Portal** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO

In this section, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with Palo Alto Networks Captive Portal based on a test user called **B.Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Palo Alto Networks Captive Portal needs to be established.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with Palo Alto Networks Captive Portal, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - Enable the user to use this feature.
    * **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - Test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with the user B.Simon.
    * **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - Set up B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
2. **[Configure Palo Alto Networks Captive Portal SSO](#configure-palo-alto-networks-captive-portal-sso)** - Configure the single sign-on settings in the application.
    * **[Create a Palo Alto Networks Captive Portal test user](#create-a-palo-alto-networks-captive-portal-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Palo Alto Networks Captive Portal that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
3. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - Verify that the configuration works.

## Next steps

Once you configure Palo Alto Networks Captive Portal you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

    a. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** text box, paste the URL provided by Euromonitor support using the following pattern:
    `https://auth.euromonitor.com/<CustomerID>`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, paste the URL:
    `https://auth.euromonitor.com/saml20/sp/acs`

    `https://login.euromonitor.com/Account/ExternalLogin?provider=<PROVIDER>&returnUrl=<PROVIDER>-signin-oidc&login_hint=<CustomerID>`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values aren't real. Update these values with the actual Identifier and Sign-on URL. [Euromonitor International support team](mailto:passport.support@euromonitor.com) provides these values.

## Configure Euromonitor International SSO

The [Euromonitor International support team](mailto:passport.support@euromonitor.com) configures and administers all application-side settings.

### Create Euromonitor International test user

In this section, you create a user called B.Simon in Euromonitor International. The SSO allows you to self-register the test user on the application side without Euromonitor support action.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to Euromonitor International Sign on URL where you can initiate the sign-in flow.  

* Go to Euromonitor International Sign-on URL directly and initiate the sign-in flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Euromonitor International for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the Euromonitor International tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the Euromonitor International for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

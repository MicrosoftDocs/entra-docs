To configure single sign-on on **Ungerboeck Software** side, you need to send the **Thumbprint value** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [Ungerboeck Software support team](mailto:Rhonda.Jannings@ungerboeck.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Ungerboeck Software test user

In this section, you create a user called B.Simon in Ungerboeck Software. Work with [Ungerboeck Software support team](mailto:Rhonda.Jannings@ungerboeck.com) to add the users in the Ungerboeck Software platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to Ungerboeck Software Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Ungerboeck Software Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the Ungerboeck Software tile in the My Apps, this option redirects to Ungerboeck Software Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

# Configure PrinterLogic for Single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID

In this article,  you learn how to integrate PrinterLogic with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate PrinterLogic with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to PrinterLogic.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to PrinterLogic with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites
The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

[!INCLUDE [common-prerequisites.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/common-prerequisites.md)]
* PrinterLogic single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* PrinterLogic supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.
* PrinterLogic supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

* PrinterLogic supports [Automated user provisioning](printer-logic-saas-provisioning-tutorial.md).

## Add PrinterLogic from the gallery

To configure the integration of PrinterLogic into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add PrinterLogic from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **PrinterLogic** in the search box.
1. Select **PrinterLogic** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for PrinterLogic

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with PrinterLogic using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in PrinterLogic.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with PrinterLogic, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
   1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
   1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure PrinterLogic SSO](#configure-printerlogic-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
   1. **[Create PrinterLogic test user](#create-printerlogic-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in PrinterLogic that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **PrinterLogic** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, enter the values for the following fields:

   a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
   `https://gw.app.printercloud.com/<my_instance>/authn/idp/azuread/saml2/metadata`

   b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
   `https://gw.app.printercloud.com/<my_instance>/authn/idp/azuread/saml2/acs`

1. Select **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

   In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
   `https://www.<my_instance>printercloud.com`

   > [!NOTE]
   > These values aren't real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Sign-on URL. Contact [PrinterLogic Client support team](mailto:support@printerlogic.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section.

1. PrinterLogic application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

   ![image](common/edit-attribute.png)

1. In addition to above, PrinterLogic application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirement.

   | Name | Source Attribute   |
   | ---- | ------------------ |
   | Role | user.assignedroles |

   > [!NOTE]
   > Please select [here](~/identity-platform/howto-add-app-roles-in-apps.md#app-roles-ui) to know how to configure Role in Microsoft Entra ID.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, find **Certificate (Base64)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

   ![The Certificate download link](common/certificatebase64.png)

1. On the **Set up PrinterLogic** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

[!INCLUDE [create-assign-users-sso.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/create-assign-users-sso.md)]

## Configure PrinterLogic SSO

To configure single sign-on on **PrinterLogic** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [PrinterLogic support team](mailto:support@printerlogic.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create PrinterLogic test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in PrinterLogic. PrinterLogic supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in PrinterLogic, a new one is created after authentication.

PrinterLogic also supports automatic user provisioning, you can find more details [here](./printer-logic-saas-provisioning-tutorial.md) on how to configure automatic user provisioning.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

#### SP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to PrinterLogic Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.

* Go to PrinterLogic Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the PrinterLogic for which you set up the SSO.

* You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the PrinterLogic tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the PrinterLogic for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

Once you configure PrinterLogic you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time.

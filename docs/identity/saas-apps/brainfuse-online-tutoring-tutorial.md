1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **Brainfuse Online Tutoring** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

To configure single sign-on on **Brainfuse Online Tutoring** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [Brainfuse Online Tutoring support team](mailto:support@brainfuse.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

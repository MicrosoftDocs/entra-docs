## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Fabric

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Fabric using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Fabric.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Fabric, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Fabric SSO](#configure-fabric-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Fabric roles](#create-fabric-roles)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Fabric that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Fabric SSO

To configure single sign-on on the **Fabric** side, send the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and the appropriate copied URLs to the K2View COE support team. The team configures the setting so that the SAML SSO connection is set properly on both sides.

For more information, see *Fabric SAML Configuration* and *Microsoft Entra SAML Setup Guide* in the [K2view Knowledge Base](https://support.k2view.com/knowledge-base.html).

### Create Fabric roles

Work with the K2View COE support team to set Fabric roles that are matched to the Microsoft Entra groups, and which are relevant to the users who are going to use Fabric. You'll provide the Fabric team the group IDs, because they are sent in the SAML response.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* In the Azure portal, select **Test this application**. You'll be redirected to the Fabric sign-on URL, where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to the Fabric sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the **Fabric** tile in the My Apps portal, you be redirected to the Fabric sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps portal, see [Introduction to the My Apps portal](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with Qualaroo

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Qualaroo with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Qualaroo with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Qualaroo.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Qualaroo with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Qualaroo single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Qualaroo supports **IDP** initiated SSO.

## Add Qualaroo from the gallery

To configure the integration of Qualaroo into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Qualaroo from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Qualaroo** in the search box.
1. Select **Qualaroo** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Qualaroo

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Qualaroo using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Qualaroo.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Qualaroo, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Qualaroo SSO](#configure-qualaroo-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Qualaroo test user](#create-qualaroo-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Qualaroo that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Assign the Microsoft Entra test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use single sign-on by granting access to Qualaroo.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).

   1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Qualaroo SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Qualaroo** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [Qualaroo support team](mailto:support@proprofs.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Qualaroo test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Qualaroo. Work with [Qualaroo support team](mailto:support@proprofs.com) to add the users in the Qualaroo platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Qualaroo for which you set up the SSO.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Qualaroo tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the Qualaroo for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

## Next steps

Once you configure Qualaroo you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with Javelo

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Javelo with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Javelo with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Javelo.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Javelo with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Javelo single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.
* Along with Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator can also add or manage applications in Microsoft Entra ID.
For more information, see [Azure built-in roles](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md).

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Javelo supports **SP** initiated SSO.
* Javelo supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add Javelo from the gallery

To configure the integration of Javelo into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Javelo from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Javelo** in the search box.
1. Select **Javelo** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Javelo

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Javelo using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Javelo.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Javelo, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Javelo SSO](#configure-javelo-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Javelo test user](#create-javelo-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Javelo that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Create Javelo test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in Javelo. Javelo supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Javelo, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Javelo Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Javelo Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Javelo tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Javelo Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure Javelo you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

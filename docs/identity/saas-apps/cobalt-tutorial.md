## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Cobalt

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Cobalt SSO](#configure-cobalt-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Cobalt test user](#create-cobalt-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Cobalt that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra integration with Flock

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Flock with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Flock with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Flock.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Flock with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.


## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Flock single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* Flock supports **SP** initiated SSO.
* Flock supports [Automated user provisioning](flock-provisioning-tutorial.md).

## Adding Flock from the gallery

To configure the integration of Flock into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Flock from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Flock** in the search box.
1. Select **Flock** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Flock

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Flock using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Flock.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Flock, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
	1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with Britta Simon.
	1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
2. **[Configure Flock SSO](#configure-flock-sso)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
	1. **[Create Flock test user](#create-flock-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Flock that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

> [!NOTE]
>Flock also supports automatic user provisioning, you can find more details [here](./flock-provisioning-tutorial.md) on how to configure automatic user provisioning.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Flock Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Flock Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Flock tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Flock Sign-on URL. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).


## Next steps

Once you configure Flock you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

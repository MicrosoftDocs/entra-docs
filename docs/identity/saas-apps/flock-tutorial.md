1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
	1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with Britta Simon.
	1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable Britta Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
2. **[Configure Flock SSO](#configure-flock-sso)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
	1. **[Create Flock test user](#create-flock-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Flock that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) integration with Zscaler B2B User Portal

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Zscaler B2B User Portal with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Zscaler B2B User Portal with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Zscaler B2B User Portal.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Zscaler B2B User Portal with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Zscaler B2B User Portal single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> This integration is also available to use from Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud environment. You can find this application in the Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud Application Gallery and configure it in the same way as you do from public cloud.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Zscaler B2B User Portal supports **IDP** initiated SSO.

* Zscaler B2B User Portal supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

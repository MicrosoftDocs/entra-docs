# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) integration with Trend Micro Web Security (TMWS)

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Trend Micro Web Security (TMWS) with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate TMWS with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to TMWS.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed in to TMWS with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location: the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* A TMWS subscription that's enabled for SSO.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you'll configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* TMWS supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Add TMWS from the gallery

To configure the integration of TMWS into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add TMWS from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, enter **Trend Micro Web Security (TMWS)** in the search box.
1. Select **Trend Micro Web Security (TMWS)** in the search results and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for TMWS

You'll configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with TMWS by using a test user called B.Simon. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in TMWS.

You'll complete these basic steps to configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with TMWS:

1. [Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso) to enable the feature for your users.
    1. [Create a Microsoft Entra user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user) to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
    1. [Grant the Microsoft Entra test user](#grant-the-azure-ad-test-user-access-to-tmws) access to TMWS.
    1. [Configure user and group synchronization settings in Microsoft Entra ID](#configure-user-and-group-synchronization-settings-in-azure-ad).
1. [Configure TMWS SSO](#configure-tmws-sso) on the application side.
1. [Test SSO](#test-sso) to verify the configuration.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Complete these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **Trend Micro Web Security (TMWS)** application integration page, in the **Manage** section, select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, select the pen button for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings:

   ![Edit the Basic SAML Configuration settings](common/edit-urls.png)

1. In the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, enter values in the following boxes:

    a. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** box, enter a URL in the following pattern:

    `https://auth.iws-hybrid.trendmicro.com/([0-9a-f]{16})`

    b. In the **Reply URL** box, enter this URL:

    `https://auth.iws-hybrid.trendmicro.com/simplesaml/module.php/saml/sp/saml2-acs.php/ics-sp`

    > [!NOTE]
    > The identifier value in the previous step isn't the value that you should enter. You need to use the actual identifier. You can get this value in the **Service Provider Settings for the Azure Admin Portal** section on the **Authentication Method** page for Microsoft Entra ID from **Administration > Directory Services**.

1. TMWS expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, so you need to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. This screenshot shows the default attributes:

    ![Default attributes](common/default-attributes.png)

1. In addition to the attributes in the preceding screenshot, TMWS expects two more attributes to be passed back in the SAML response. These attributes are shown in the following table. The attributes are pre-populated, but you can change them to meet your requirements.
    
    | Name | Source attribute|
    | --------------- | --------- |
    | `sAMAccountName` | `user.onpremisessamaccountname` |
    | `upn` | `user.userprincipalname` |

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, find **Certificate (Base64)**. Select the **Download** link next to this certificate name to download the certificate and save it on your computer:

    ![Certificate download link](common/certificatebase64.png)

1. In the **Set up Trend Micro Web Security (TMWS)** section, copy the appropriate URL or URLs, based on your requirements:

    ![Copy the configuration URLs](common/copy-configuration-urls.png)

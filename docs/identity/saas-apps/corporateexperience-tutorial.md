# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) integration with CorporateExperience

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate CorporateExperience with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate CorporateExperience with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to CorporateExperience.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to CorporateExperience with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* CorporateExperience single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* CorporateExperience supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Add CorporateExperience from the gallery

To configure the integration of CorporateExperience into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add CorporateExperience from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **CorporateExperience** in the search box.
1. Select **CorporateExperience** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for CorporateExperience

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with CorporateExperience using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in CorporateExperience.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with CorporateExperience, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure CorporateExperience SSO](#configure-corporateexperience-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create CorporateExperience test user](#create-corporateexperience-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in CorporateExperience that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **CorporateExperience** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps: 

    a. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<CustomerName>.corporateparking.parso.cr/users/saml/metadata`

	b. In the **Sign on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<CustomerName>.corporateparking.parso.cr/users/saml/auth`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier and Sign on URL. Contact [CorporateExperience Client support team](mailto:support@parso.cr) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section.

1. Your CorporateExperience application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows an example for this. The default value of **Unique User Identifier** is **user.userprincipalname** but CorporateExperience expects this to be mapped with the user's email address. For that you can use **user.mail** attribute from the list or use the appropriate attribute value based on your organization configuration.

	![image](common/default-attributes.png)

1. In addition to above, CorporateExperience application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.
	
	| Name | Source Attribute |
	| --------- | --------- |
	| email | user.mail |
	| first_name | user.givenname |
	| user_name | user.netbiosname |
	| organization | user.companyname |
	| uid | user.mail |

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Certificate (Base64)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

	![The Certificate download link](common/certificatebase64.png)

1. On the **Set up CorporateExperience** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

### Assign the Microsoft Entra test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use single sign-on by granting access to CorporateExperience.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **CorporateExperience**.
1. In the app's overview page, select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user/group**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
   1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
   1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
   1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure CorporateExperience SSO

To configure single sign-on on **CorporateExperience** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [CorporateExperience support team](mailto:support@parso.cr). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create CorporateExperience test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in CorporateExperience. Work withÂ [CorporateExperience support team](mailto:support@parso.cr) to add the users in the CorporateExperience platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to CorporateExperience Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to CorporateExperience Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the CorporateExperience tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to CorporateExperience Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure CorporateExperience you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâs sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

## Configure Labelbox SSO

To complete the OAuth/OIDC federation setup on **Labelbox** side, you need to send the copied values like Client ID, Client Secret and OIDC Metadata file from Entra to [Labelbox support team](mailto:support@labelbox.com). They set this setting to have the OIDC connection set properly on both sides.

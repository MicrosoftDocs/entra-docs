# Tutorial: Integrate Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) with NetSuite

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate NetSuite with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate NetSuite with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to NetSuite.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed in to NetSuite with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location, the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* A NetSuite single sign-on (SSO)-enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment. 

NetSuite supports:

* IDP-initiated SSO.
* JIT (just-in-time) user provisioning.

> [!NOTE]
> Because the identifier of this application is a fixed string value, only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add NetSuite from the gallery

To configure the integration of NetSuite into Microsoft Entra ID, add NetSuite from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps by doing the following:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **NetSuite** in the search box.
1. In the results pane, select **NetSuite**, and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for NetSuite

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with NetSuite by using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in NetSuite.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with NetSuite, perform the following steps:

1. [Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso) to enable your users to use this feature.
    * [Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user) to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with user B.Simon.  
    * [Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user) to enable user B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. [Configure NetSuite SSO](#configure-netsuite-sso) to configure the single sign-on settings on the application side.
    * [Create the NetSuite test user](#create-the-netsuite-test-user) to have a counterpart of user B.Simon in NetSuite that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of the user.
1. [Test SSO](#test-sso) to verify that the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

To enable Microsoft Entra SSO in the Azure portal, do the following:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **NetSuite** application integration page, look for the **Manage** section, and then select **Single sign-on**.
1. In the **Select a single sign-on method** pane, select **SAML**.
1. In the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** pane, select the **Edit** ("pencil") icon next to **Basic SAML Configuration**.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. In the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, in the **Reply URL** text box, type the URL:
`https://system.netsuite.com/saml2/acs`

1. NetSuite application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![image](common/default-attributes.png)

1. In addition to above, NetSuite application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.

	| Name | Source attribute |
	| ---------------| --------------- |
	| account  | `account id` |

	> [!NOTE]
	> The value of the account attribute is not real. You'll update this value, as explained later in this tutorial.The account id is not necessary unless you explicitly want to block the functionality of jumping from Production to the Sandbox in Netsuite within the navigation control.

1. On the Set up single sign-on with SAML page, in the SAML Signing Certificate section, find Federation Metadata XML and select Download to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

	![The certificate Download link](common/metadataxml.png)

1. In the **Set up NetSuite** section, copy the appropriate URL or URLs, depending on your requirement.

### Create the NetSuite test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in NetSuite. NetSuite supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in NetSuite, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

- Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the NetSuite for which you set up the SSO

- You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the NetSuite tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the NetSuite for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure the NetSuite you can enforce session controls, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session controls extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

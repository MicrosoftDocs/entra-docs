# Tutorial: Configure Postman for automatic user provisioning

This tutorial describes the steps you need to perform in both Postman and Microsoft Entra ID to configure automatic user provisioning. When configured, Microsoft Entra ID automatically provisions and de-provisions users and groups to [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) using the Microsoft Entra provisioning service. For important details on what this service does, how it works, and frequently asked questions, see [Automate user provisioning and deprovisioning to SaaS applications with Microsoft Entra ID](~/identity/app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md). 


## Supported capabilities
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create users in Postman.
> * Remove users in Postman when they do not require access anymore.
> * Keep user attributes synchronized between Microsoft Entra ID and Postman.
> * Provision groups and group memberships in Postman.
> * [Single sign-on](postman-tutorial.md) to Postman (recommended).

## Prerequisites

The scenario outlined in this tutorial assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

* [A Microsoft Entra tenant](~/identity-platform/quickstart-create-new-tenant.md). 
* One of the following roles: [Application Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#application-administrator), [Cloud Application Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#cloud-application-administrator), or [Application Owner](/entra/fundamentals/users-default-permissions#owned-enterprise-applications).
* A Postman tenant on the [Enterprise plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/).
* A user account in Postman with Admin permissions.

## Step 1: Plan your provisioning deployment
1. Learn about [how the provisioning service works](~/identity/app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md).
1. Determine who will be in [scope for provisioning](~/identity/app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).
1. Determine what data to [map between Microsoft Entra ID and Postman](~/identity/app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes.md).

## Step 2: Configure Postman to support provisioning with Microsoft Entra ID

Before you begin to configure Postman to support provisioning with Microsoft Entra ID, you’ll need to generate a SCIM API token within the Postman Admin Console.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can visit the page [Postman SCIM provisioning overview](https://learning.postman.com/docs/administration/scim-provisioning/scim-provisioning-overview/#enabling-scim-in-postman), to refer **Enable SCIM provisioning in Postman** steps.

1. Navigate to [Postman Admin Console](https://go.postman.co/home) by logging in to your Postman account.
1. Once you’ve logged in, click **Team** on the right side and click **Team Settings**.
1. Select **Authentication** in the sidebar and then turn on  the **SCIM provisioning** toggle.

   ![Screenshot of Postman authentication settings page.](media/postman-provisioning-tutorial/postman-authentication-settings.png)

1. You will receive a pop up message asking whether you want to **Turn on SCIM Provisioning**, click **Turn On** to enable SCIM provisioning.

    ![Screenshot of modal to enable SCIM provisioning.](media/postman-provisioning-tutorial/postman-enable-scim-provisioning.png)
1. To **Generate SCIM API Key**, perform the following steps:

   1. Select **Generate SCIM API Key** in the **SCIM provisioning** section.

      ![Screenshot to generate SCIM API key in Postman.](media/postman-provisioning-tutorial/postman-generate-scim-api-key.png)

   1. Enter name of the key and click **Generate**.
   1. Copy your new API key for later use and click **Done**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can revisit this page to manage your SCIM API keys. If you regenerate an existing API key, you will have the option to keep the first key active while you switch over.

   > [!NOTE]
   > To continue enabling SCIM provisioning, see [Configuring SCIM with Microsoft Entra ID](https://learning.postman.com/docs/administration/scim-provisioning/configuring-scim-with-azure-ad/). For further information or help configuring SCIM, [contact Postman support](https://www.postman.com/support/).

## Step 3: Add Postman from the Microsoft Entra application gallery

Add Postman from the Microsoft Entra application gallery to start managing provisioning to Postman. If you have previously set up Postman for SSO you can use the same application. However, it's recommended that you create a separate app when testing out the integration initially. Learn more about adding an application from the gallery [here](~/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal.md). 

## Step 4: Define who will be in scope for provisioning 

The Microsoft Entra provisioning service allows you to scope who will be provisioned based on assignment to the application and or based on attributes of the user / group. If you choose to scope who will be provisioned to your app based on assignment, you can use the following [steps](~/identity/enterprise-apps/assign-user-or-group-access-portal.md) to assign users and groups to the application. If you choose to scope who will be provisioned based solely on attributes of the user or group, you can use a scoping filter as described [here](~/identity/app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md). 

* Start small. Test with a small set of users and groups before rolling out to everyone. When the scope for provisioning is set to assigned users and groups, you can control this by assigning one or two users or groups to the app. When the scope is set to all users and groups, you can specify an [attribute based scoping filter](~/identity/app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).

* If you need more roles, you can [update the application manifest](~/identity-platform/howto-add-app-roles-in-apps.md) to add new roles.


## Step 5: Configure automatic user provisioning to Postman 

This section guides you through the steps to configure the Microsoft Entra provisioning service to create, update, and disable users and/or groups in TestApp based on user and/or group assignments in Microsoft Entra ID.

### To configure automatic user provisioning for Postman in Microsoft Entra ID:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications**

	![Screenshot of Enterprise applications blade.](common/enterprise-applications.png)

1. In the applications list, select **Postman**.

	![Screenshot of the Postman link in the Applications list.](common/all-applications.png)

1. Select the **Provisioning** tab.

	![Screenshot of Provisioning tab.](common/provisioning.png)

1. Set the **Provisioning Mode** to **Automatic**.

	![Screenshot of Provisioning tab automatic.](common/provisioning-automatic.png)

1. Under the **Admin Credentials** section, input `https://api.getpostman.com/scim/v2/` as your Postman Tenant URL and your [SCIM API key](https://learning.postman.com/docs/administration/scim-provisioning/scim-provisioning-overview/#generating-scim-api-key) as the Secret Token. Click **Test Connection** to ensure Microsoft Entra ID can connect to Postman. If the connection fails, ensure your Postman account has Admin permissions and try again.

 	![Screenshot of Token.](common/provisioning-testconnection-tenanturltoken.png)

1. In the **Notification Email** field, enter the email address of a person or group who should receive the provisioning error notifications and select the **Send an email notification when a failure occurs** check box.

	![Screenshot of Notification Email.](common/provisioning-notification-email.png)

1. Select **Save**.

1. Under the **Mappings** section, select **Synchronize Microsoft Entra users to Postman**.

1. Review the user attributes that are synchronized from Microsoft Entra ID to Postman in the **Attribute-Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the user accounts in Postman for update operations. If you choose to change the [matching target attribute](~/identity/app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes.md), you'll need to ensure that the Postman API supports filtering users based on that attribute. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.

   |Attribute|Type|Supported for filtering|Required by Postman|
   |---|---|---|---|
   |userName|String|&check;|&check;
   |active|Boolean||&check;
   |name.givenName|String||&check;
   |name.familyName|String||&check;
   
1. Under the **Mappings** section, select **Synchronize Microsoft Entra groups to Postman**.

1. Review the group attributes that are synchronized from Microsoft Entra ID to Postman in the **Attribute-Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the groups in Postman for update operations. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.

   |Attribute|Type|Supported for filtering|Required by Postman|
   |---|---|---|---|
   |displayName|String|&check;|&check;
   |members|Reference||
   
1. To configure scoping filters, refer to the following instructions provided in the [Scoping filter tutorial](~/identity/app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).

1. To enable the Microsoft Entra provisioning service for Postman, change the **Provisioning Status** to **On** in the **Settings** section.

	![Screenshot of Provisioning Status Toggled On.](common/provisioning-toggle-on.png)

1. Define the users and/or groups that you would like to provision to Postman by choosing the desired values in **Scope** in the **Settings** section.

	![Screenshot of Provisioning Scope.](common/provisioning-scope.png)

1. When you're ready to provision, click **Save**.

	![Screenshot of Saving Provisioning Configuration.](common/provisioning-configuration-save.png)

This operation starts the initial synchronization cycle of all users and groups defined in **Scope** in the **Settings** section. The initial cycle takes longer to perform than subsequent cycles, which occur approximately every 40 minutes as long as the Microsoft Entra provisioning service is running. 

## Step 6: Monitor your deployment
Once you've configured provisioning, use the following resources to monitor your deployment:

* Use the [provisioning logs](~/identity/monitoring-health/concept-provisioning-logs.md) to determine which users have been provisioned successfully or unsuccessfully.
* Check the [progress bar](~/identity/app-provisioning/application-provisioning-when-will-provisioning-finish-specific-user.md) to see the status of the provisioning cycle and how close it's to completion.
* If the provisioning configuration seems to be in an unhealthy state, the application goes into quarantine. Learn more about quarantine states [here](~/identity/app-provisioning/application-provisioning-quarantine-status.md).

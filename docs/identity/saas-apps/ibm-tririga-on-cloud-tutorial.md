# Microsoft Entra SSO integration with IBM TRIRIGA on Cloud

In this article, you learn how to integrate IBM TRIRIGA on Cloud with Microsoft Entra ID. IWMS that integrates functionalities across real estate, capital projects, facilities, workplace operations, portfolio data, and environmental and energy management within a single technology platform. When you integrate IBM TRIRIGA on Cloud with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to IBM TRIRIGA on Cloud.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to IBM TRIRIGA on Cloud with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

You configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on for IBM TRIRIGA on Cloud in a test environment. IBM TRIRIGA on Cloud supports **IDP** initiated single sign-on.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Microsoft Entra ID with IBM TRIRIGA on Cloud, you need:

* A Microsoft Entra user account. If you don't already have one, you can [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* One of the following roles: Global Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator, or owner of the service principal.
* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* IBM TRIRIGA on Cloud single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Add application and assign a test user

Before you begin the process of configuring single sign-on, you need to add the IBM TRIRIGA on Cloud application from the Microsoft Entra gallery. You need a test user account to assign to the application and test the single sign-on configuration.

### Add IBM TRIRIGA on Cloud from the Microsoft Entra gallery

Add IBM TRIRIGA on Cloud from the Microsoft Entra application gallery to configure single sign-on with IBM TRIRIGA on Cloud. For more information on how to add application from the gallery, see the [Quickstart: Add application from the gallery](~/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal.md).

### Create and assign Microsoft Entra test user

Follow the guidelines in the [create and assign a user account](~/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal-assign-users.md) article to create a test user account called B.Simon.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, and assign roles. The wizard also provides a link to the single sign-on configuration pane.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Complete the following steps to enable Microsoft Entra single sign-on.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **IBM TRIRIGA on Cloud** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Screenshot shows how to edit Basic SAML Configuration.](common/edit-urls.png "Basic Configuration")

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

	a. In the **Identifier** textbox, type a URL using one of the following patterns:

	| **Identifier** |
	|------------|
	| `https://<CustomerName>.tririga.com` |
	| `https://<CustomerName-Environment>.tririga.com` |

	b. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type a URL using one of the following patterns:

	| **Reply URL** |
	|----------|
	| `https://<CustomerName>.tririga.com/samlsps` |
	| `https://<CustomerName-Environment>.tririga.com/samlsps` |

	> [!Note]
    > These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier and Reply URL. Contact [IBM TRIRIGA on Cloud support team](https://www.ibm.com/mysupport) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the Basic SAML Configuration section.

1. On the **Set-up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

    ![Screenshot shows the Certificate download link.](common/metadataxml.png "Certificate")

1. On the **Set up IBM TRIRIGA on Cloud** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

	![Screenshot shows to copy configuration appropriate URL.](common/copy-configuration-urls.png "Metadata")

## Configure IBM TRIRIGA on Cloud SSO

To configure single sign-on on **IBM TRIRIGA on Cloud** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [IBM TRIRIGA on Cloud support team](https://www.ibm.com/mysupport). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides

### Create IBM TRIRIGA on Cloud test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in IBM TRIRIGA on Cloud. Work with [IBM TRIRIGA on Cloud support team](https://www.ibm.com/mysupport) to add the users in the IBM TRIRIGA on Cloud platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the IBM TRIRIGA on Cloud for which you set up the SSO.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the IBM TRIRIGA on Cloud tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the IBM TRIRIGA on Cloud for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

## Next steps

Once you configure IBM TRIRIGA on Cloud you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

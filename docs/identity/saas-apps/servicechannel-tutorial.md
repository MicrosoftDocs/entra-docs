# Configure ServiceChannel for Single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID

In this article,  you learn how to integrate ServiceChannel with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate ServiceChannel with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

- Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to ServiceChannel.
- Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to ServiceChannel with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
- Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites
The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

[!INCLUDE [common-prerequisites.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/common-prerequisites.md)]
- ServiceChannel single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

- ServiceChannel supports **IDP** initiated SSO
- ServiceChannel supports **Just In Time** user provisioning

## Adding ServiceChannel from the gallery

To configure the integration of ServiceChannel into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add ServiceChannel from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **ServiceChannel** in the search box.
1. Select **ServiceChannel** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for ServiceChannel

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with ServiceChannel using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in ServiceChannel.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with ServiceChannel, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
   1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
   1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure ServiceChannel SSO](#configure-servicechannel-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
   1. **[Create ServiceChannel test user](#create-servicechannel-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in ServiceChannel that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

1. The role claim is pre-configured so you don't have to configure it but you still need to create them in Microsoft Entra ID using this [article](~/identity-platform/howto-add-app-roles-in-apps.md#app-roles-ui). You can refer ServiceChannel guide [here](https://servicechannel.zendesk.com/hc/en-us) for more guidance on claims.

## Configure ServiceChannel SSO

To configure single sign-on on **ServiceChannel** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [ServiceChannel support team](https://servicechannel.zendesk.com/hc/). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create ServiceChannel test user

Application supports Just in time user provisioning and after authentication users are created in the application automatically. For full user provisioning, please contact [ServiceChannel support team](https://servicechannel.zendesk.com/hc/).

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

- Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the ServiceChannel for which you set up the SSO

- You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the ServiceChannel tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the ServiceChannel for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

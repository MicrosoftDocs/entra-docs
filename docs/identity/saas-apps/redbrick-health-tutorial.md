# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with RedBrick Health

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate RedBrick Health with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate RedBrick Health with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to RedBrick Health.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to RedBrick Health with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* RedBrick Health single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* RedBrick Health supports **IDP** initiated SSO.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add RedBrick Health from the gallery

To configure the integration of RedBrick Health into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add RedBrick Health from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **RedBrick Health** in the search box.
1. Select **RedBrick Health** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for RedBrick Health

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with RedBrick Health using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in RedBrick Health.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with RedBrick Health, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure RedBrick Health SSO](#configure-redbrick-health-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create RedBrick Health test user](#create-redbrick-health-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in RedBrick Health that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure RedBrick Health SSO

To configure single sign-on on **RedBrick Health** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [RedBrick Health support team](https://home.redbrickhealth.com/contact/). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create RedBrick Health test user

In this section, you create a user called B.Simon in RedBrick Health. Work with [RedBrick Health support team](https://home.redbrickhealth.com/contact/) to add the users in the RedBrick Health platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the RedBrick Health for which you set up the SSO.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the RedBrick Health tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the RedBrick Health for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure RedBrick Health you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

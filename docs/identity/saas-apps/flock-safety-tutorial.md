# Microsoft Entra SSO integration with Flock Safety

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Flock Safety with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Flock Safety with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Flock Safety.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Flock Safety with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Microsoft Entra ID with Flock Safety, you need:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Flock Safety single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Flock Safety supports **SP** initiated SSO.
* Flock Safety supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Adding Flock Safety from the gallery

To configure the integration of Flock Safety into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Flock Safety from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Flock Safety** in the search box.
1. Select **Flock Safety** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Flock Safety

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Flock Safety using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Flock Safety.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Flock Safety, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-microsoft-entra-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-a-microsoft-entra-id-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-microsoft-entra-id-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Flock Safety SSO](#configure-flock-safety-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Flock Safety test user](#create-flock-safety-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Flock Safety that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO in the Microsoft Entra admin center.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).

   1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Flock Safety SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Flock Safety** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and appropriate copied URLs from Microsoft Entra admin center to [Flock Safety support team](mailto:support@flocksafety.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Flock Safety test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in Flock Safety. Flock Safety supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Flock Safety, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.
 
* Click on **Test this application** in Microsoft Entra admin center. This will redirect to Flock Safety Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow.
 
* Go to Flock Safety Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.
 
* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Flock Safety tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Flock Safety Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next Steps

Once you configure Flock Safety you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization's sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

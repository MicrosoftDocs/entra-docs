1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure AskYourTeam SSO](#configure-askyourteam-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create AskYourTeam test user](#create-askyourteam-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in AskYourTeam that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.

* Go to AskYourTeam Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the AskYourTeam tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the AskYourTeam for which you set up the SSO.

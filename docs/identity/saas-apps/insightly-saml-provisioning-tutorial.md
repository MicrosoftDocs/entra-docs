# Configure Insightly SAML for automatic user provisioning with Microsoft Entra ID

This article describes the steps you need to perform in both Insightly SAML and Microsoft Entra ID to configure automatic user provisioning. When configured, Microsoft Entra ID automatically provisions and deprovisions users to [Insightly SAML](https://www.insightly.com/) using the Microsoft Entra provisioning service. For important details on what this service does, how it works, and frequently asked questions, see [Automate user provisioning and deprovisioning to SaaS applications with Microsoft Entra ID](~/identity/app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md). 


## Supported capabilities
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create users in Insightly SAML.
> * Remove users in Insightly SAML when they don't require access anymore.
> * Keep user attributes synchronized between Microsoft Entra ID and Insightly SAML.
> * [Single sign-on](insightly-saml-tutorial.md) to Insightly SAML (recommended).

## Prerequisites

The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

* [A Microsoft Entra tenant](~/identity-platform/quickstart-create-new-tenant.md) 
* One of the following roles: [Application Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#application-administrator), [Cloud Application Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#cloud-application-administrator), or [Application Owner](/entra/fundamentals/users-default-permissions#owned-enterprise-applications).
* A user account in Insightly SAML with Admin permissions.

## Step 1: Plan your provisioning deployment

* Learn about [how the provisioning service works](~/identity/app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md).
* Determine who's in [scope for provisioning](~/identity/app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).
* Determine what data to [map between Microsoft Entra ID and Insightly SAML](~/identity/app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes.md).

## Step 2: Configure Insightly SAML to support provisioning with Microsoft Entra ID

Contact Insightly SAML support to configure Insightly SAML to support provisioning with Microsoft Entra ID.

## Step 3: Add Insightly SAML from the Microsoft Entra application gallery

Add Insightly SAML from the Microsoft Entra application gallery to start managing provisioning to Insightly SAML. If you have previously setup Insightly SAML for SSO, you can use the same application. However it's recommended that you create a separate app when testing out the integration initially. Learn more about adding an application from the gallery [here](~/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal.md). 

## Step 4: Define who is in scope for provisioning

## Step 5: Configure automatic user provisioning to Insightly SAML 

This section guides you through the steps to configure the Microsoft Entra provisioning service to create, update, and disable users in Insightly SAML based on user assignments in Microsoft Entra ID.

### To configure automatic user provisioning for Insightly SAML in Microsoft Entra ID:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps**

1. In the applications list, select **Insightly SAML**.

1. Select the **Provisioning** tab.

	![Screenshot of Provisioning tab.](common/provisioning.png)

1. Set the **Provisioning Mode** to **Automatic**.

	![Screenshot of Provisioning tab automatic.](common/provisioning-automatic.png)

1. Under the **Admin Credentials** section, input your Insightly SAML Tenant URL and Secret Token. Select **Test Connection** to ensure Microsoft Entra ID can connect to Insightly SAML. If the connection fails, ensure your Insightly SAML account has Admin permissions and try again.

1. In the **Notification Email** field, enter the email address of a person who should receive the provisioning error notifications and select the **Send an email notification when a failure occurs** check box.

	![Screenshot of Notification Email.](common/provisioning-notification-email.png)

1. Select **Save**.

1. Under the **Mappings** section, select **Synchronize Microsoft Entra users to Insightly SAML**.

1. Review the user attributes that are synchronized from Microsoft Entra ID to Insightly SAML in the **Attribute-Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the user accounts in Insightly SAML for update operations. If you choose to change the [matching target attribute](~/identity/app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes.md), you need to ensure that the Insightly SAML API supports filtering users based on that attribute. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.

   |Attribute|Type|Supported for filtering|Required by Insightly SAML|
   |---|---|---|---|
   |userName|String|&check;|&check;|
   |active|Boolean||&check;|
   |name.givenName|String||&check;|
   |name.familyName|String||&check;|

1. To configure scoping filters, refer to the following instructions provided in the [Scoping filter article](~/identity/app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).

1. To enable the Microsoft Entra provisioning service for Insightly SAML, change the **Provisioning Status** to **On** in the **Settings** section.

	![Screenshot of Provisioning Status Toggled On.](common/provisioning-toggle-on.png)

1. Define the users that you would like to provision to Insightly SAML by choosing the desired values in **Scope** in the **Settings** section.

	![Screenshot of Provisioning Scope.](common/provisioning-scope.png)

1. When you're ready to provision, select **Save**.

This operation starts the initial synchronization cycle of all users defined in **Scope** in the **Settings** section. The initial cycle takes longer to perform than subsequent cycles, which occur approximately every 40 minutes as long as the Microsoft Entra provisioning service is running. 

## Step 6: Monitor your deployment

# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) integration with Eccentex AppBase for Azure

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Eccentex AppBase for Azure with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Eccentex AppBase for Azure with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Eccentex AppBase for Azure.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Eccentex AppBase for Azure with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Eccentex AppBase for Azure single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Eccentex AppBase for Azure supports **SP** initiated SSO.

* Eccentex AppBase for Azure supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Add Eccentex AppBase for Azure from the gallery

To configure the integration of Eccentex AppBase for Azure into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Eccentex AppBase for Azure from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Eccentex AppBase for Azure** in the search box.
1. Select **Eccentex AppBase for Azure** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Eccentex AppBase for Azure

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Eccentex AppBase for Azure using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Eccentex AppBase for Azure.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Eccentex AppBase for Azure, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Eccentex AppBase for Azure SSO](#configure-eccentex-appbase-for-azure-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Eccentex AppBase for Azure test user](#create-eccentex-appbase-for-azure-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Eccentex AppBase for Azure that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Create Eccentex AppBase for Azure test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in Eccentex AppBase for Azure. Eccentex AppBase for Azure supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Eccentex AppBase for Azure, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Eccentex AppBase for Azure Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Eccentex AppBase for Azure Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Eccentex AppBase for Azure tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Eccentex AppBase for Azure Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure Eccentex AppBase for Azure you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

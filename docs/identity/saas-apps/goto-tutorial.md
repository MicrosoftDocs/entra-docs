[!INCLUDE [common-prerequisites.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/common-prerequisites.md)]
* GoTo single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* GoTo supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.
* GoTo supports [Automated user provisioning](goto-provisioning-tutorial.md).

## Adding GoTo from the gallery

To configure the integration of GoTo into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add GoTo from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **GoTo** in the search box.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for GoTo

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with GoTo using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in GoTo.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with GoTo, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    * **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    * **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure GoTo SSO](#configure-goto-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    * **[Create GoTo test user](#create-goto-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in GoTo that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **GoTo** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, the user doesn't have to perform any steps as the app is already pre-integrated with Azure.

1. Select **Set additional URLs** and perform the following steps if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

	a. In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type the URL:
    `https://authentication.gotoinc.com/login?service=https%3A%2F%2Fmyaccount.gotoinc.com`

1. Your GoTo application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes, whereas **Unique User Identifier** is mapped with **user.userprincipalname**. GoTo application expects **Unique User Identifier** to be mapped with **user.mail**, so you need to edit the attribute mapping by selecting **Edit** icon and change the attribute mapping.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, In the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, select copy button to copy **App Federation Metadata Url** and save it on your computer.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to GoTo Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to GoTo Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the GoTo for which you set up the SSO 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the GoTo tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the GoTo for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

# Configure Postman for Single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID

In this article,  you learn how to integrate Postman with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Postman with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Postman.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Postman with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites
The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

[!INCLUDE [common-prerequisites.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/common-prerequisites.md)]
* Postman single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> This integration is also available to use from Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud environment. You can find this application in the Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud Application Gallery and configure it in the same way as you do from public cloud.

## Scenario description

In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Postman supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.
* Postman supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add Postman from the gallery

To configure the integration of Postman into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Postman from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Postman** in the search box.
1. Select **Postman** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Postman

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Postman using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Postman.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Postman, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Postman SSO](#configure-postman-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Postman test user](#create-postman-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Postman that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **Postman** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, perform the following step:

    In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://identity.getpostman.com/sso/<INSTANCE_NAME>/callback`

1. Select **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://identity.getpostman.com/sso/<INSTANCE_NAME>/init`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values aren't real. Update these values with the actual Reply URL and Sign-on URL. Contact [Postman Client support team](mailto:help@getpostman.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section.

1. Your Postman application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows an example for this. The default value of **Unique User Identifier** is **user.userprincipalname** but Postman expects this to be mapped with the user's email address. For that you can use **user.mail** attribute from the list or use the appropriate attribute value based on your organization configuration.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

1. On the **Set up Postman** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

## Configure Postman SSO

To configure single sign-on on the **Postman** side, you need to upload the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and update the appropriate copied URLs at Postman. To learn how to configure Postman SSO, see the [step-by-step guide](https://learning.postman.com/docs/administration/sso/admin-sso/).

### Create Postman test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in Postman. Postman supports just-in-time user provisioning, which can be enabled by selecting  the checkbox to [Automatically add new users](https://learning.postman.com/docs/administration/sso/admin-sso/#automatically-adding-new-users). With this, if a user doesn't already exist in Postman, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to Postman Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Postman Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Postman for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the Postman tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Postman for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra integration with Uberflip

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Uberflip with Microsoft Entra ID.

Integrating Uberflip with Microsoft Entra ID provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Uberflip.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed in to Uberflip (single sign-on) with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location: the Azure portal.

For details about software as a service (SaaS) app integration with Microsoft Entra ID, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID?](~/identity/enterprise-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To configure Microsoft Entra integration with Uberflip, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.
* An Uberflip subscription with single sign-on enabled.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

Uberflip supports the following features:

* SP-initiated and IDP-initiated single sign-on (SSO).
* Just-in-time user provisioning.

## Add Uberflip from the Azure Marketplace

To configure the integration of Uberflip into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Uberflip from the Azure Marketplace to your list of managed SaaS apps:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with Uberflip based on a test user named **B Simon**. For single sign-on to work, you need to establish a link between a Microsoft Entra user and a related user in Uberflip.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with Uberflip, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra single sign-on](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** to enable your users to use this feature.
1. **[Configure Uberflip single sign-on](#configure-uberflip-single-sign-on)** to configure the single sign-on settings on the application side.
1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B. Simon.
1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** to enable B. Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Create an Uberflip test user](#create-an-uberflip-test-user)** so that there's a user named B. Simon in Uberflip who's linked to the Microsoft Entra user named B. Simon.
1. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** to verify whether the configuration works.

### Test single sign-on

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration by using the My Apps portal.

When you select **Uberflip** in the My Apps portal, you should be automatically signed in to the Uberflip subscription for which you set up single sign-on. For more information about the My Apps portal, see [Access and use apps on the My Apps portal](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

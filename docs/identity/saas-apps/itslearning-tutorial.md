## Configure itslearning SSO

To set up single sign-on (SSO), begin by contacting your itslearning sales representative or account manager for pricing information and to be connected with the technical team. They need the App Federation Metadata URL from your Microsoft Entra configuration. If you're unsure who to reach out to, contact our [support team](mailto:support@itslearning.com) for assistance.

### Create itslearning test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in itslearning. Work with itslearning technical team to add the users in the itslearning platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to itslearning Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to itslearning Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the itslearning tile in the My Apps, this option redirects to itslearning Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

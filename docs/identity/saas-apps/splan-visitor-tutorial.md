In this article,  you learn how to integrate Splan Visitor with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Splan Visitor with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Use Microsoft Entra ID to control who has access to Splan Visitor.
* Enable users to be automatically signed in to Splan Visitor with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location, the Azure portal.

The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

[!INCLUDE [common-prerequisites.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/common-prerequisites.md)]
* A Splan Visitor single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> This integration is also available to use from Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud environment. You can find this application in the Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud Application Gallery and configure it in the same way as you do from public cloud.

## Scenario description

In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Splan Visitor supports IdP-initiated SSO.

## Add Splan Visitor from the gallery

To configure the integration of Splan Visitor into Microsoft Entra ID, add Splan Visitor from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).

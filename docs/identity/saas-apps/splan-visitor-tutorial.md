# Tutorial: Integrate Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) with Splan Visitor

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Splan Visitor with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Splan Visitor with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Use Microsoft Entra ID to control who has access to Splan Visitor.
* Enable users to be automatically signed in to Splan Visitor with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location, the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* A Splan Visitor single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> This integration is also available to use from Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud environment. You can find this application in the Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud Application Gallery and configure it in the same way as you do from public cloud.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you'll configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Splan Visitor supports IdP-initiated SSO.

## Add Splan Visitor from the gallery

To configure the integration of Splan Visitor into Microsoft Entra ID, add Splan Visitor from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, enter **Splan Visitor** in the search box.
1. Select **Splan Visitor** from the results panel, and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure Splan Visitor SSO

To configure single sign-on with Splan Visitor, send the **Federation Metadata XML** that you downloaded and appropriate copied URLs to the [Splan Visitor support team](mailto:support@splan.com). This ensures that the SAML SSO connection is set properly on both sides.

### Create a Splan Visitor test user

Create a test user named **Britta Simon** in Splan Visitor. Work withÂ the [Splan Visitor support team](mailto:support@splan.com) to add the user to Splan Visitor. You must create and activate the user before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO

Test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with one of the following options:

* **Azure portal**: Select **Test this application** to automatically sign in to the Splan Visitor for which you set up SSO.
* **Microsoft My Apps portal**: Select the **Splan Visitor** tile to automatically sign in to the Splan Visitor for which you set up SSO. For more information about the My Apps portal, see [Sign in and start apps from the My Apps portal](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

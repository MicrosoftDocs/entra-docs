# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) integration with SAP NetWeaver

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate SAP NetWeaver with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate SAP NetWeaver with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to SAP NetWeaver.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to SAP NetWeaver with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* SAP NetWeaver single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.
* SAP NetWeaver V7.20 or later

## Scenario description

* SAP NetWeaver supports both **SAML** (**SP initiated SSO**) and **OAuth**. In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment. 

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

> [!NOTE]
> Configure the application either in SAML or in OAuth as per your organizational requirement. 

## Adding SAP NetWeaver from the gallery

To configure the integration of SAP NetWeaver into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add SAP NetWeaver from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **SAP NetWeaver** in the search box.
1. Select **SAP NetWeaver** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for SAP NetWeaver

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with SAP NetWeaver using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in SAP NetWeaver.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with SAP NetWeaver, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure SAP NetWeaver using SAML](#configure-sap-netweaver-using-saml)** to configure the SSO settings on application side.
    1. **[Create SAP NetWeaver test user](#create-sap-netweaver-test-user)** to have a counterpart of B.Simon in SAP NetWeaver that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** to verify whether the configuration works.
1. **[Configure SAP NetWeaver for OAuth​](#configure-sap-netweaver-for-oauth)** to configure the OAuth settings on application side.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

In this section, you enable Microsoft Entra single sign-on.

To configure Microsoft Entra single sign-on with SAP NetWeaver, perform the following steps:

1. Open a new web browser window and sign into your SAP NetWeaver company site as an administrator

1. Make sure that **http** and **https** services are active and appropriate ports are assigned in **SMICM** T-Code.

1. Sign on to business client of SAP System (T01), where SSO is required and activate HTTP Security session Management.

   1. Go to Transaction code **SICF_SESSIONS**. It displays all relevant profile parameters with current values. They look like below:-

      ```
      login/create_sso2_ticket = 2
      login/accept_sso2_ticket = 1
      login/ticketcache_entries_max = 1000
      login/ticketcache_off = 0  login/ticket_only_by_https = 0 
      icf/set_HTTPonly_flag_on_cookies = 3
      icf/user_recheck = 0  http/security_session_timeout = 1800
      http/security_context_cache_size = 2500
      rdisp/plugin_auto_logout = 1800
      rdisp/autothtime = 60
      ```

      >[!NOTE]
      > Adjust above parameters as per your organization requirements, Above parameters are given here as indication only.

   1. If necessary adjust parameters, in the instance/default profile of SAP system and restart SAP system.

   1. Double-click on relevant client to enable HTTP security session.

      ![The HTTP Security session](./media/sapnetweaver-tutorial/tutorial_sapnetweaver_profileparameter.png)

   1. Activate below SICF services:

      ```
      /sap/public/bc/sec/saml2
      /sap/public/bc/sec/cdc_ext_service
      /sap/bc/webdynpro/sap/saml2
      /sap/bc/webdynpro/sap/sec_diag_tool (This is only to enable / disable trace)
      ```

1. Go to Transaction code **SAML2** in business client of SAP system [T01/122]. It will open a user interface in a browser. In this example, we assumed 122 as SAP business client.

   ![Transaction code](./media/sapnetweaver-tutorial/tutorial_sapnetweaver_sapbusinessclient.png)

1. Provide your username and password to enter in user interface and click **Edit**.

   ![username and password](./media/sapnetweaver-tutorial/tutorial_sapnetweaver_userpwd.png)

1. Replace **Provider Name** from T01122 to `http://T01122` and click on **Save**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > By default provider name come as `<sid><client>` format but Microsoft Entra ID expects name in the format of `<protocol>://<name>`, recommending to maintain provider name as `https://<sid><client>` to allow multiple SAP NetWeaver ABAP engines to configure in Microsoft Entra ID.

   ![The multiple SAP NetWeaver ABAP engines](./media/sapnetweaver-tutorial/tutorial_sapnetweaver_providername.png)

1. **Generating Service Provider Metadata**:- Once we are done with configuring the **Local Provider** and **Trusted Providers** settings on SAML 2.0 User Interface, the next step would be to generate the service provider’s metadata file (which would contain all the settings, authentication contexts, and other configurations in SAP). Once this file is generated, upload this file to Microsoft Entra ID.

   ![Generating Service Provider Metadata](./media/sapnetweaver-tutorial/tutorial_sapnetweaver_generatesp.png)

   1. Go to **Local Provider tab**.

   1. Click on **Metadata**.

   1. Save the generated **Metadata XML file** on your computer and upload it in **Basic SAML Configuration** section to autopopulate the **Identifier** and **Reply URL** values in Azure portal.

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **SAP NetWeaver** application integration page, find the **Manage** section, and select **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, perform the following step:

   1. Click **Upload metadata file** to upload the **Service Provider metadata file**, which you have obtained earlier.

   1. Click on **folder logo** to select the metadata file and click **Upload**.

   1. After the metadata file is successfully uploaded, the **Identifier** and **Reply URL** values get auto populated in **Basic SAML Configuration** section textbox as shown below:

   1. In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<your company instance of SAP NetWeaver>`

   > [!NOTE]
   > Some customers have encountered an error of an incorrect Reply URL configured for their instance. If you receive any such error, use these PowerShell commands. First update the Reply URLs in the application object with the Reply URL, then update the service principal. Use the [Get-MgServicePrincipal](/powershell/module/microsoft.graph.applications/get-mgserviceprincipal) to get the Service Principal ID value.
   >
   > ```powershell
   > $params = @{
   >    web = @{
   >       redirectUris = "<Your Correct Reply URL>"
   >    }
   > }
   > Update-MgApplication -ApplicationId "<Application ID>" -BodyParameter $params
   > Update-MgServicePrincipal -ServicePrincipalId "<Service Principal ID>" -ReplyUrls "<Your Correct Reply URL>"
   > ```
   >

1. SAP NetWeaver application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes. Click **Edit** icon to open User Attributes dialog.

    ![edit attribute](common/edit-attribute.png)

1. In the **User Claims** section on the **User Attributes** dialog, configure SAML token attribute as shown in the image above and perform the following steps:

    1. Click **Edit icon** to open the **Manage user claims** dialog.

        ![edit icon](./media/sapnetweaver-tutorial/nameidattribute.png)

        ![image](./media/sapnetweaver-tutorial/nameidattribute1.png)

    1. From the **Transformation** list, select **ExtractMailPrefix()**.

    1. From the **Parameter 1** list, select **user.userprincipalname**.

    1. Click **Save**.

1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

   ![The Certificate download link](common/metadataxml.png)

1. On the **Set up SAP NetWeaver** section, copy the appropriate URLs, based on your requirement.

### Create SAP NetWeaver test user

In this section, you create a user called B.simon in SAP NetWeaver. Please work your in house SAP expert team or work with your organization SAP partner to add the users in the SAP NetWeaver platform.

## Test SSO

1. Once the identity provider Microsoft Entra ID was activated, try accessing below URL to check SSO, ensuring there will not be a prompt for username & password.

    `https://<sapurl>/sap/bc/bsp/sap/it00/default.htm`

    (or) use the URL below

    `https://<sapurl>/sap/bc/bsp/sap/it00/default.htm`

    > [!NOTE]
    > Replace sapurl with actual SAP hostname.

2. The above URL should take you to below mentioned screen. If you are able to reach up to the below page, Microsoft Entra SSO setup is successfully done.

    ![test Single Sign-On](./media/sapnetweaver-tutorial/testingsso.png)

3. If a username and password prompt occurs, you can diagnose the issue by enabling a trace, using the URL:

    `https://<sapurl>/sap/bc/webdynpro/sap/sec_diag_tool?sap-client=122&sap-language=EN#`

## Configure SAP NetWeaver for OAuth

1. SAP Documented process is available at the location: [NetWeaver Gateway Service Enabling and OAuth 2.0 Scope Creation](https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/display/Security/NetWeaver+Gateway+Service+Enabling+and+OAuth+2.0+Scope+Creation)

2. Go to SPRO and find **Activate and Maintain services**.

    ![Activate and Maintain services](./media/sapnetweaver-tutorial/oauth01.png)

3. In this example we want to connect the OData service: `DAAG_MNGGRP` with OAuth to Microsoft Entra SSO. Use the technical service name search for the service `DAAG_MNGGRP` and activate if not yet active, already (look for `green` status under ICF nodes tab). Ensure if system alias (the connected backend system, where the service actually running) is correct.

    ![OData service](./media/sapnetweaver-tutorial/oauth02.png)

    * Then click pushbutton **OAuth** on the top button bar and assign `scope` (keep default name as offered).

4. For our example, the scope is `DAAG_MNGGRP_001`. It is generated from the service name by automatically adding a number. Report `/IWFND/R_OAUTH_SCOPES` can be used to change name of scope or create manually.

    ![Configure OAuth](./media/sapnetweaver-tutorial/oauth03.png)

    > [!NOTE]
    > Message `soft state status is not supported` – can be ignored, as no problem.

### Create a service user for the OAuth 2.0 Client

1. OAuth2 uses a `service ID` to get the access token for the end-user on its behalf. Important restriction by OAuth design: the `OAuth 2.0 Client ID` must be identical with the `username` the OAuth 2.0 client uses for login when requesting an Access Token. Therefore, for our example, we are going to register an OAuth 2.0 client with name CLIENT1. As a prerequisite, a user with the same name (CLIENT1) must exist in the SAP system and that user we will configure to be used by the referred application. 

2. When registering an OAuth Client we use the `SAML Bearer Grant type`.

    >[!NOTE]
    >For more details, refer OAuth 2.0 Client Registration for the SAML Bearer Grant Type [here](https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/display/Security/OAuth+2.0+Client+Registration+for+the+SAML+Bearer+Grant+Type).

3. Execute T-Code `SU01` to create user CLIENT1 as `System type` and assign password. Save the password as you will need to provide the credential to the API programmer, who should save it with the username to the calling code. No profile or role should be assigned.

### Register the new OAuth 2.0 Client ID with the creation wizard

1. To register a new **OAuth 2.0 client** start transaction **SOAUTH2**. The transaction will display an overview about the OAuth 2.0 clients that were already registered. Choose **Create** to start the wizard for the new OAuth client named as CLIENT1 in this example.

2. Go to T-Code: **SOAUTH2** and Provide the description then click **next**.

    ![SOAUTH2](./media/sapnetweaver-tutorial/oauth04.png)

    ![OAuth 2.0 Client ID](./media/sapnetweaver-tutorial/oauth05.png)

3. Select the already added **SAML2 IdP – Microsoft Entra ID** from the dropdown list and save.

    ![SAML2 IdP – Microsoft Entra ID 1](./media/sapnetweaver-tutorial/oauth06.png)

    ![SAML2 IdP – Microsoft Entra ID 2](./media/sapnetweaver-tutorial/oauth07.png)

    ![SAML2 IdP – Microsoft Entra ID 3](./media/sapnetweaver-tutorial/oauth08.png)

4. Click on **Add** under scope assignment to add the previously created scope: `DAAG_MNGGRP_001`

    ![Scope](./media/sapnetweaver-tutorial/oauth09.png)

    ![scope assignment](./media/sapnetweaver-tutorial/oauth10.png)

5. Click **finish**.

## Next Steps

Once you configure Microsoft Entra SAP NetWeaver you can enforce Session Control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session Control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

# FortiGate Azure Virtual Machine Deployment Guide

Using this deployment guide, you will learn how to set up and work with the Fortinet FortiGate next-generation firewall product deployed as an Azure Virtual Machine. Additionally, you will configure the FortiGate SSL VPN Microsoft Entra Gallery App to provide VPN authentication through Microsoft Entra ID.

## Redeem the FortiGate License

The Fortinet FortiGate next-generation firewall product is available as a virtual machine in Azure infrastructure as a service (IaaS). There are two licensing modes for this virtual machine: pay-as-you-go and bring-your-own-license (BYOL).

If you have purchased a FortiGate license from Fortinet to use with the BYOL virtual machine deployment option, redeem it from Fortinet's product activation page â€“ https://support.fortinet.com. The resulting license file will have a .lic file extension.

## Download Firmware

At the time of writing, the Fortinet FortiGate Azure VM does not ship with the firmware version needed for SAML authentication. The latest version must be obtained from Fortinet.

1. Sign in at https://support.fortinet.com/.
2. Go to **Download** > **Firmware Images**.
3. To the right of **Release Notes**, select **Download**.
4. Select **v6.00** > **6.4** > **6.4.2**.
5. Download **FGT_VM64_AZURE-v6-build1723-FORTINET.out** by selecting the **HTTPS** link on the same row.
6. Save the file for later.

## Deploy the FortiGate VM

1. Go to the Azure portal, and sign in to the subscription into which you will deploy the FortiGate virtual machine.
2. Create a new resource group, or open the resource group into which you will deploy the FortiGate virtual machine.
3. Select **Add**.
4. In **Search the Marketplace**, enter *Forti*. Select **Fortinet FortiGate Next-Generation Firewall**.
5. Select the software plan (bring-your-own-license if you have a license, or pay-as-you-go if not). Select **Create**.
6. Populate the VM configuration.

### Ensure FortiGate VM has Correct Route to On-Premises Corporate Resources

Multi-homed Azure VMs have all network interfaces on the same virtual network (but perhaps separate subnets). This often means that both network interfaces have a connection to the on-premises corporate resources being published via FortiGate. For this reason, it is necessary to create custom route entries that ensure traffic exits from the correct interface when requests for on-premises corporate resources are made.

1. Go to `https://<address>:8443`. Here, `<address>` is the FQDN or the public IP address assigned to the FortiGate VM.

2. Sign-in using the administrator credentials provided during the FortiGate VM deployment.
3. In the menu on the left, select **Networking**.
4. Under Network, select **Static Routes**.
5. Select **Create New**.
6. Next to Destination select **Subnet**.
7. Under Subnet, specify the subnet information where the on-premises corporate resources reside (such as `10.1.0.0/255.255.255.0`).
8. Next to Gateway Address specify the gateway on the Azure subnet where port2 is connected (for example, this usually ends in `1`, as in `10.6.1.1`).
9. Next to Interface select the internal network interface, `port2`.
10. Select **OK**.

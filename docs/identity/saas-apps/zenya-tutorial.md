# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) integration with Zenya

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Zenya with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Zenya with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Zenya.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Zenya with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Zenya single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Zenya supports **SP** initiated SSO.
* Zenya supports [Automated user provisioning](zenya-provisioning-tutorial.md).

## Add Zenya from the gallery

To configure the integration of Zenya into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Zenya from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Zenya** in the search box.
1. Select **Zenya** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Zenya

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Zenya using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Zenya.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Zenya, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Zenya SSO](#configure-zenya-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Zenya test user](#create-zenya-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Zenya that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Retrieve configuration information from Zenya

In this section, you retrieve information from Zenya to configure Microsoft Entra single sign-on.

1. Open a web browser and go to the **SAML2 info** page in Zenya by using the following URL patterns:
	
     `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.zenya.work/saml2info`   
     `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.iprova.nl/saml2info`  
     `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.iprova.be/saml2info`  
     `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.iprova.eu/saml2info` 

	![Screenshot of the Zenya SAML2 information page.](media/zenya-tutorial/information.png)

1. Leave the browser tab open while you proceed with the next steps in another browser tab.

	![Screenshot showing the list of default attributes.](common/default-attributes.png)

1. In addition to above, Zenya application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.

	| Name | Source Attribute| Namespace  |
	| ---------------| -------- | -----|
	| `samaccountname` | `user.onpremisessamaccountname`| `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims`|

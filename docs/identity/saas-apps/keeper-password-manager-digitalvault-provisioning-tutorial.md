# Tutorial: Configure Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault for automatic user provisioning

The objective of this tutorial is to demonstrate the steps to be performed in Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault and Microsoft Entra ID to configure Microsoft Entra ID to automatically provision and de-provision users and/or groups to Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault.

> [!NOTE]
> This tutorial describes a connector built on top of the Microsoft Entra user Provisioning Service. For important details on what this service does, how it works, and frequently asked questions, see [Automate user provisioning and deprovisioning to SaaS applications with Microsoft Entra ID](~/identity/app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md).
>

## Prerequisites

The scenario outlined in this tutorial assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

* A Microsoft Entra tenant
* [A Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault tenant](https://keepersecurity.com/pricing.html?t=e)
* A user account in Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault with Admin permissions.

## Add Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault from the gallery

Before configuring Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault for automatic user provisioning with Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault from the Microsoft Entra application gallery to your list of managed SaaS applications.

**To add Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault from the Microsoft Entra application gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault**, select **Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault** in the search box.
1. Select **Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Assigning users to Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault

Microsoft Entra ID uses a concept called *assignments* to determine which users should receive access to selected apps. In the context of automatic user provisioning, only the users and/or groups that have been assigned to an application in Microsoft Entra ID are synchronized.

Before configuring and enabling automatic user provisioning, you should decide which users and/or groups in Microsoft Entra ID need access to Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault. Once decided, you can assign these users and/or groups to Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault by following the instructions here:

* [Assign a user or group to an enterprise app](~/identity/enterprise-apps/assign-user-or-group-access-portal.md)

### Important tips for assigning users to Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault

* It is recommended that a single Microsoft Entra user is assigned to Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault to test the automatic user provisioning configuration. Additional users and/or groups may be assigned later.

* When assigning a user to Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault, you must select any valid application-specific role (if available) in the assignment dialog. Users with the **Default Access** role are excluded from provisioning.

## Configuring automatic user provisioning to Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault 

This section guides you through the steps to configure the Microsoft Entra provisioning service to create, update, and disable users and/or groups in Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault based on user and/or group assignments in Microsoft Entra ID.

> [!TIP]
> You may also choose to enable SAML-based single sign-on for Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault, following the instructions provided in the [Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault single sign-on tutorial](keeperpasswordmanager-tutorial.md). Single sign-on can be configured independently of automatic user provisioning, though these two features complement each other.

	![Keeper Group Mappings](media/keeper-password-manager-digitalvault-provisioning-tutorial/keeper-group-mappings.png)

13. Review the group attributes that are synchronized from Microsoft Entra ID to Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault in the **Attribute Mapping** section.

	![Keeper Group Attributes](media/keeper-password-manager-digitalvault-provisioning-tutorial/keeper-group-attributes.png)

14. To configure scoping filters, refer to the following instructions provided in the [Scoping filter tutorial](~/identity/app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).

15. To enable the Microsoft Entra provisioning service for Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault, change the **Provisioning Status** to **On** in the **Settings** section.

	![Provisioning Status Toggled On](common/provisioning-toggle-on.png)

16. Define the users and/or groups that you would like to provision to Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault by choosing the desired values in **Scope** in the **Settings** section.

	![Provisioning Scope](common/provisioning-scope.png)

17. When you are ready to provision, click **Save**.

	![Saving Provisioning Configuration](common/provisioning-configuration-save.png)

This operation starts the initial synchronization of all users and/or groups defined in **Scope** in the **Settings** section. The initial sync takes longer to perform than subsequent syncs, which occur approximately every 40 minutes as long as the Microsoft Entra provisioning service is running. You can use the **Synchronization Details** section to monitor progress and follow links to provisioning activity report, which describes all actions performed by the Microsoft Entra provisioning service on Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault.

For more information on how to read the Microsoft Entra provisioning logs, see [Reporting on automatic user account provisioning](~/identity/app-provisioning/check-status-user-account-provisioning.md).

## Connector Limitations

* Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault requires **emails** and **userName** to have the same source value, as any updates to either attributes will modify the other value.
* Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault does not support user deletes, only disable. Disabled users will appear as locked in the Keeper Admin Console UI.

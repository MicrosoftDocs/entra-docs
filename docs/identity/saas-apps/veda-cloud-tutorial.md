# Customer intent: As an IT administrator, I want to learn how to configure single sign-on between Microsoft Entra ID and VEDA Cloud so that I can control who has access to VEDA Cloud, enable automatic sign-in with Microsoft Entra accounts, and manage my accounts in one central location.

# Microsoft Entra SSO integration with VEDA Cloud

In this article, you learn how to integrate VEDA Cloud with Microsoft Entra ID. This application enables Microsoft Entra ID to act as SAML IdP for authenticating users to your VEDA HR Cloud Solutions. When you integrate VEDA Cloud with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to VEDA Cloud.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to VEDA Cloud with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

You configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on for VEDA Cloud in a test environment. VEDA Cloud supports **SP** initiated single sign-on.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Microsoft Entra ID with VEDA Cloud, you need:

* A Microsoft Entra user account. If you don't already have one, you can [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* One of the following roles: [Application Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#application-administrator), [Cloud Application Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#cloud-application-administrator), or [Application Owner](/entra/fundamentals/users-default-permissions#owned-enterprise-applications).
* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* VEDA Cloud single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Add application and assign a test user

Before you begin the process of configuring single sign-on, you need to add the VEDA Cloud application from the Microsoft Entra gallery. You need a test user account to assign to the application and test the single sign-on configuration.

### Add VEDA Cloud from the Microsoft Entra gallery

Add VEDA Cloud from the Microsoft Entra application gallery to configure single sign-on with VEDA Cloud. For more information on how to add application from the gallery, see the [Quickstart: Add application from the gallery](~/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal.md).

<a name='create-and-assign-azure-ad-test-user'></a>

### Create and assign Microsoft Entra test user

Follow the guidelines in the [create and assign a user account](~/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal-assign-users.md) article to create a test user account called B.Simon.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, and assign roles. The wizard also provides a link to the single sign-on configuration pane.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Complete the following steps to enable Microsoft Entra single sign-on.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **VEDA Cloud** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Screenshot shows how to edit Basic SAML Configuration.](common/edit-urls.png "Basic Configuration")

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** textbox, type a URL using one of the following patterns:

    | **Identifier** |
    |-----------|
    | `https://vedacustomers.b2clogin.com/<CUSTOMER>/B2C_1A_VEDASIGNIN` |
    | `https://vedacustomersprod.b2clogin.com/<CUSTOMER>/B2C_1A_VEDASIGNIN` |
    | `https://login.veda.net/<ID>/B2C_1A_VEDASIGNIN` |

    b. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type a URL using one of the following patterns:

    | **Reply URL** |
    | ----------|
    | `https://vedacustomers.b2clogin.com/<CUSTOMER>/B2C_1A_VEDASIGNIN/samlp/sso/assertionconsumer` |
    | `https://vedacustomersprod.b2clogin.com/<CUSTOMER>/B2C_1A_VEDASIGNIN/samlp/sso/assertionconsumer` |
    | `https://login.veda.net/<ID>/B2C_1A_VEDASIGNIN/samlp/sso/assertionconsumer` |

    c. In the **Sign on URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<DOMAIN>.veda.net/<INSTANCE>`
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Sign on URL. Contact [VEDA Cloud Client support team](mailto:peoplemanagement@veda.net) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section.

1. VEDA Cloud application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![Screenshot shows the image of attributes configuration.](common/default-attributes.png "Image")

1. In addition to above, VEDA Cloud application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response, which are shown. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.

	| Name |  Source Attribute|
	| ---------------|  --------- |
    | displayname | user.displayname |

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click copy button to copy **App Federation Metadata Url** and save it on your computer.

    ![Screenshot shows the Certificate download link.](common/copy-metadataurl.png "Certificate")

## Configure VEDA Cloud SSO

To configure single sign-on on **VEDA Cloud** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [VEDA Cloud support team](mailto:peoplemanagement@veda.net). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create VEDA Cloud test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon at VEDA Cloud. Work with [VEDA Cloud support team](mailto:peoplemanagement@veda.net) to add the users in the VEDA Cloud platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to VEDA Cloud Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to VEDA Cloud Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the VEDA Cloud tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to VEDA Cloud Sign-on URL. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

## Next steps

Once you configure VEDA Cloud you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

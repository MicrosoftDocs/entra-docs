# Customer intent: As an IT administrator, I want to learn how to configure single sign-on between Microsoft Entra ID and WhosOff so that I can control who has access to WhosOff, enable automatic sign-in with Microsoft Entra accounts, and manage my accounts in one central location.

# Microsoft Entra SSO integration with WhosOff

In this article, you'll learn how to integrate WhosOff with Microsoft Entra ID. WhosOff is an online leave management platform. Azure's WhosOff integration allows customers to sign in to their WhosOff account using Azure as a single sign-on provider. When you integrate WhosOff with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to WhosOff.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to WhosOff with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

You'll configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on for WhosOff in a test environment. WhosOff supports both **SP** and **IDP** initiated single sign-on.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Microsoft Entra ID with WhosOff, you need:

* A Microsoft Entra user account. If you don't already have one, you can [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* One of the following roles: [Application Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#application-administrator), [Cloud Application Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#cloud-application-administrator), or [Application Owner](/entra/fundamentals/users-default-permissions#owned-enterprise-applications).
* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* WhosOff single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Add application and assign a test user

Before you begin the process of configuring single sign-on, you need to add the WhosOff application from the Microsoft Entra gallery. You need a test user account to assign to the application and test the single sign-on configuration.

### Add WhosOff from the Microsoft Entra gallery

Add WhosOff from the Microsoft Entra application gallery to configure single sign-on with WhosOff. For more information on how to add application from the gallery, see the [Quickstart: Add application from the gallery](~/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal.md).

### Create and assign Microsoft Entra test user

Follow the guidelines in the [create and assign a user account](~/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal-assign-users.md) article to create a test user account called B.Simon.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, and assign roles. The wizard also provides a link to the single sign-on configuration pane.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Complete the following steps to enable Microsoft Entra single sign-on.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **WhosOff** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Screenshot shows how to edit Basic SAML Configuration.](common/edit-urls.png "Basic Configuration")

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, the user doesn't have to perform any step as the app is already preintegrated with Azure.

1. Perform the following step, if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

	In the **Sign on URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
	`https://app.whosoff.com/int/<Integration_ID>/sso/azure/`

	> [!NOTE]
    > This value is not real. Update this value with the actual Sign on URL. You can collect `Integration_ID` from your WhosOff account when activating Azure SSO which is explained later in this tutorial. For any queriers, please contact [WhosOff support team](mailto:support@whosoff.com). You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section.

1. On the **Set-up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

    ![Screenshot shows the Certificate download link.](common/metadataxml.png "Certificate")

1. On the **Set up WhosOff** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

## Configure WhosOff SSO

1. Log in to your WhosOff company site as an administrator.

1. Go to **ADMINISTRATION** on the left hand menu and click **COMPANY SETTINGS** > **Single Sign On**.

1. In the **Setup Single Sign On** section, perform the following steps:
	
	![Screenshot shows settings of metadata and configuration.](./media/whosoff-tutorial/metadata.png "Account")

	1. Select **Azure** SSO provider from the drop-down and click **Active SSO**.

	1. Once activated, copy the **Integration GUID** and save it on your computer.

	1. Upload **Federation Metadata XML** file by clicking on the **Choose File** option, which you have downloaded.

	1. Click **Save changes**.

### Create WhosOff test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon at WhosOff SSO. Work with [WhosOff support team](mailto:support@whosoff.com) to add the users in the WhosOff SSO platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to WhosOff Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to WhosOff Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the WhosOff for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the WhosOff tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign-on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the WhosOff for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

## Next steps

Once you configure WhosOff you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

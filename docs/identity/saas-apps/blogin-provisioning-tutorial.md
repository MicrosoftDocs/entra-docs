# Configure BlogIn for automatic user provisioning with Microsoft Entra ID

This article describes the steps you need to perform in both BlogIn and Microsoft Entra ID to configure automatic user provisioning. When configured, Microsoft Entra ID automatically provisions and deprovisions users and groups to [BlogIn](https://blogin.co/) using the Microsoft Entra provisioning service. For important details on what this service does, how it works, and frequently asked questions, see [Automate user provisioning and deprovisioning to SaaS applications with Microsoft Entra ID](~/identity/app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md). 


## Capabilities Supported
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create users in BlogIn
> * Remove users in BlogIn when they don't require access anymore
> * Keep user attributes synchronized between Microsoft Entra ID and BlogIn
> * Provision groups and group memberships in BlogIn
> * [Single sign-on](./blogin-tutorial.md) to BlogIn (recommended)

## Prerequisites

The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

[!INCLUDE [common-prerequisites.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/common-prerequisites.md)]
* A user account in BlogIn with Administrator role.

## Step 1: Plan your provisioning deployment
1. Learn about [how the provisioning service works](~/identity/app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md).
2. Determine who's in [scope for provisioning](~/identity/app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).
3. Determine what data to [map between Microsoft Entra ID and BlogIn](~/identity/app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes.md).

## Step 2: Configure BlogIn to support provisioning with Microsoft Entra ID

To configure user provisioning on **BlogIn**, login to your BlogIn account and follow these steps:

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **User Authentication** > **Configure SSO & User provisioning**.
2. Switch to the **User provisioning** tab and change User provisioning status to **On**.
3. Select the **Save changes** button. Upon first save, the **Secret (Bearer) token** is generated.
4. Copy **Base (Tenant) URL** and **Secret (Bearer) token** values. These values are entered in the Tenant URL and Secret Token fields in the Provisioning tab of your BlogIn application.

For a more detailed explanation of setting up user provisioning on BlogIn, see [Set up User Provisioning via SCIM](https://blogin.co/blog/set-up-user-provisioning-via-scim-254/). Please reach out to the [BlogIn support team](mailto:support@blogin.co) if you have any questions or need help.

## Step 3: Add BlogIn from the Microsoft Entra application gallery

Add BlogIn from the Microsoft Entra application gallery to start managing provisioning to BlogIn. If you have previously setup BlogIn for SSO, you can use the same application. However, we recommend that you create a separate app when testing out the integration initially. Learn more about adding an application from the gallery [here](~/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal.md). 

## Step 4: Define who is in scope for provisioning 

[!INCLUDE [create-assign-users-provisioning.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/create-assign-users-provisioning.md)]

## Step 5: Configure automatic user provisioning to BlogIn 

This section guides you through the steps to configure the Microsoft Entra provisioning service to create, update, and disable users and/or groups in TestApp based on user and/or group assignments in Microsoft Entra ID.

### To configure automatic user provisioning for BlogIn in Microsoft Entra ID:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps**

    ![Screenshot shows the Enterprise applications blade.](common/enterprise-applications.png)

1. In the applications list, select **BlogIn**.

    ![Screenshot shows the BlogIn link in the Applications list.](common/all-applications.png)

3. Select the **Provisioning** tab.

    ![Screenshot shows the Provisioning tab.](common/provisioning.png)

4. Set the **Provisioning Mode** to **Automatic**.

    ![Screenshot shows the Provisioning tab automatic.](common/provisioning-automatic.png)

5. Under the **Admin Credentials** section, input your BlogIn Tenant URL and Secret Token. Select **Test Connection** to ensure Microsoft Entra ID can connect to BlogIn. If the connection fails, ensure your BlogIn account has Admin permissions and try again.

    ![Screenshot shows the Token.](common/provisioning-testconnection-tenanturltoken.png)

6. In the **Notification Email** field, enter the email address of a person or group who should receive the provisioning error notifications and select the **Send an email notification when a failure occurs** check box.

    ![Screenshot shows the Notification Email.](common/provisioning-notification-email.png)

7. Select **Save**.

8. Under the **Mappings** section, select **Synchronize Microsoft Entra users to BlogIn**.

9. Review the user attributes that are synchronized from Microsoft Entra ID to BlogIn in the **Attribute-Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the user accounts in BlogIn for update operations. If you choose to change the [matching target attribute](~/identity/app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes.md), you need to ensure that the BlogIn API supports filtering users based on that attribute. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.

   |Attribute|Type|
   |---|---|
   |userName|String|
   |active|Boolean|
   |title|String|
   |emails[type eq "work"].value|String|
   |name.givenName|String|
   |name.familyName|String|
   |name.formatted|String|
   |phoneNumbers[type eq "work"].value|String|

10. Under the **Mappings** section, select **Synchronize Microsoft Entra groups to BlogIn**.

11. Review the group attributes that are synchronized from Microsoft Entra ID to BlogIn in the **Attribute-Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the groups in BlogIn for update operations. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.

    |Attribute|Type|
    |---|---|
    |displayName|String|
    |members|Reference|

12. To configure scoping filters, refer to the following instructions provided in the [Scoping filter  article](~/identity/app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).

13. To enable the Microsoft Entra provisioning service for BlogIn, change the **Provisioning Status** to **On** in the **Settings** section.

    ![Screenshot shows the Provisioning Status Toggled On.](common/provisioning-toggle-on.png)

14. Define the users and/or groups that you would like to provision to BlogIn by choosing the desired values in **Scope** in the **Settings** section.

    ![Screenshot shows the Provisioning Scope.](common/provisioning-scope.png)

15. When you're ready to provision, select **Save**.

    ![Screenshot shows the Saving Provisioning Configuration.](common/provisioning-configuration-save.png)

This operation starts the initial synchronization cycle of all users and groups defined in **Scope** in the **Settings** section. The initial cycle takes longer to perform than subsequent cycles, which occur approximately every 40 minutes as long as the Microsoft Entra provisioning service is running. 

## Step 6: Monitor your deployment

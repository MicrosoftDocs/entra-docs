# Configure Peoplecart for Single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID

In this article,  you learn how to integrate Peoplecart with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Peoplecart with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Peoplecart.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Peoplecart with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Peoplecart single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.
* Along with Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator can also add or manage applications in Microsoft Entra ID.
For more information, see [Azure built-in roles](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md).

## Scenario description

In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* Peoplecart supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Add Peoplecart from the gallery

To configure the integration of Peoplecart into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Peoplecart from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Peoplecart** in the search box.
1. Select **Peoplecart** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Peoplecart SSO](#configure-peoplecart-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Peoplecart test user](#create-peoplecart-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Peoplecart that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.

## Configure Peoplecart SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Peoplecart** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [Peoplecart support team](https://peoplecart.com/ContactUs.aspx). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Peoplecart test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Peoplecart. Work with [Peoplecart support team](https://peoplecart.com/ContactUs.aspx) to add the users in the Peoplecart platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to Peoplecart Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Peoplecart Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the Peoplecart tile in the My Apps, this option redirects to Peoplecart Sign-on URL. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

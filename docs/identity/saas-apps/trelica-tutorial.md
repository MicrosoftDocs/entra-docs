# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with Trelica

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Trelica with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Trelica with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Trelica.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed in to Trelica with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location: the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* A Trelica subscription with single sign-on (SSO) enabled.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Trelica supports IDP-initiated SSO.
* Trelica supports just-in-time user provisioning.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add Trelica from the gallery

To configure the integration of Trelica into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Trelica from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, enter **Trelica** in the search box.
1. Select **Trelica** from the search results, and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Trelica

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Trelica by using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you must establish a linked relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Trelica.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Trelica, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Trelica SSO](#configure-trelica-sso)** to configure the single sign-on settings on the application side.
    1. **[Create a Trelica test user](#create-a-trelica-test-user)** to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Trelica. This counterpart is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of the user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** to verify whether the configuration works.

Read the [Trelica help documentation](https://docs.trelica.com/admin/saml/azure-ad) or contact the [Trelica Client support team](mailto:support@trelica.com) if you have questions.

### Create a Trelica test user

Trelica supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action for you to take in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Trelica, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Trelica for which you set up the SSO.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Trelica tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the Trelica for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

## Next steps

Once you configure Trelica you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

### Create a Trelica test user

Trelica supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action for you to take in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Trelica, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Trelica for which you set up the SSO.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the Trelica tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the Trelica for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

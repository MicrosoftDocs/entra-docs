## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for AwardSpring

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with AwardSpring using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in AwardSpring.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with AwardSpring, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure AwardSpring SSO](#configure-awardspring-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create AwardSpring test user](#create-awardspring-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in AwardSpring that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **AwardSpring** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<subdomain>.awardspring.com/SignIn/SamlMetaData`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<subdomain>.awardspring.com/SignIn/SamlAcs`

1. Select **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<subdomain>.awardspring.com/`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values aren't real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Sign-on URL. Contact [AwardSpring Client support team](mailto:support@awardspring.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section.

1. AwardSpring application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![image](common/default-attributes.png)

1. In addition to above, AwardSpring application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.

	|  Name | Source Attribute |
	| ---------------| --------------- |
	| First Name | user.givenname |
	| Last Name | user.surname |
	| Email | user.mail |
	| Username | user.userprincipalname |
	| StudentID | < Student ID > |

	> [!NOTE]
	> The StudentID attribute is mapped with the actual Student ID which needs to be passed back in claims. Contact [AwardSpring Client support team](mailto:support@awardspring.com) to get this value.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

## Configure AwardSpring SSO

To configure single sign-on on **AwardSpring** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [AwardSpring support team](mailto:support@awardspring.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create AwardSpring test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in AwardSpring. AwardSpring supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in AwardSpring, a new one is created after authentication.

> [!Note]
> If you need to create a user manually, contact [AwardSpring support team](mailto:support@awardspring.com).

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to AwardSpring Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to AwardSpring Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the AwardSpring for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the AwardSpring tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the AwardSpring for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

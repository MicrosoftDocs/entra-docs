# Configure Terraform Cloud for Single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID

In this article,  you learn how to integrate Terraform Cloud with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Terraform Cloud with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Terraform Cloud.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Terraform Cloud with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites
The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

[!INCLUDE [common-prerequisites.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/common-prerequisites.md)]
* Terraform Cloud single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Terraform Cloud supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.
* Terraform Cloud supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Add Terraform Cloud from the gallery

To configure the integration of Terraform Cloud into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Terraform Cloud from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Terraform Cloud** in the search box.
1. Select **Terraform Cloud** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Terraform Cloud

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Terraform Cloud using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Terraform Cloud.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Terraform Cloud, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Terraform Cloud SSO](#configure-terraform-cloud-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Terraform Cloud test user](#create-terraform-cloud-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Terraform Cloud that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Create Terraform Cloud test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in Terraform Cloud. Terraform Cloud supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Terraform Cloud, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to Terraform Cloud Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Terraform Cloud Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Terraform Cloud for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the Terraform Cloud tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Terraform Cloud for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

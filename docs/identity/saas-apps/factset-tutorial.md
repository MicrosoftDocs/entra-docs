1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure FactSet SSO](#configure-factset-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create FactSet test user](#create-factset-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in FactSet that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.

## Configure FactSet SSO

To configure single sign-on on FactSet side you need to visit FactSet's [Control Center](https://controlcenter.factset.com) and configure the **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal under **Control Center's Security > Single Sign-On (SSO)** page. If you require access to this page, please contact [FactSet Support Team](https://www.factset.com/contact-us) and request FactSet product 8514 (Control Center - Source IPs, Security + Authentication).

### Create FactSet test user

Work with your FactSet account support representatives or contact [FactSet Support Team](https://www.factset.com/contact-us) to add the users in the FactSet platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following option.

* FactSet only supports SP-initiated SAML. You may test SSO by visiting any authenticated FactSet URL such as [Issue Tracker](https://issuetracker.factset.com) or [FactSet-Web](https://my.factset.com), select **Single Sign-On (SSO)** on the logon portal and supply your email address in the subsequent page. Please see supplied [documentation](https://download.factset.com/documents/web/FactSet_Single_Sign-On.pdf) for additional information and usage.

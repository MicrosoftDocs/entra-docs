# Customer intent: As an IT administrator, I want to learn how to configure single sign-on between Microsoft Entra ID and Illumio SSO so that I can control who has access to Illumio SSO, enable automatic sign-in with Microsoft Entra accounts, and manage my accounts in one central location.

# Microsoft Entra SSO integration with Illumio SSO

In this article, you learn how to integrate Illumio SSO with Microsoft Entra ID. Illumio SSO app provides a simple, convenient, and secure way for organizations to manage user access to illumio PCE. When you integrate Illumio SSO with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Illumio SSO.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Illumio SSO with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

You'll configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on for Illumio SSO in a test environment. Illumio SSO supports both **SP** and **IDP** initiated single sign-on.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Microsoft Entra ID with Illumio SSO, you need:

* A Microsoft Entra user account. If you don't already have one, you can [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* One of the following roles: [Application Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#application-administrator), [Cloud Application Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#cloud-application-administrator), or [Application Owner](/entra/fundamentals/users-default-permissions#owned-enterprise-applications).
* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Illumio SSO single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Add application and assign a test user

Before you begin the process of configuring single sign-on, you need to add the Illumio SSO application from the Microsoft Entra gallery. You need a test user account to assign to the application and test the single sign-on configuration.

### Add Illumio SSO from the Microsoft Entra gallery

Add Illumio SSO from the Microsoft Entra application gallery to configure single sign-on with Illumio SSO. For more information on how to add application from the gallery, see the [Quickstart: Add application from the gallery](~/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal.md).

<a name='create-and-assign-azure-ad-test-user'></a>

### Create and assign Microsoft Entra test user

Follow the guidelines in the [create and assign a user account](~/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal-assign-users.md) article to create a test user account called B.Simon.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, and assign roles. The wizard also provides a link to the single sign-on configuration pane.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Complete the following steps to enable Microsoft Entra single sign-on.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **Illumio SSO** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Screenshot shows how to edit Basic SAML Configuration.](common/edit-urls.png "Basic Configuration")

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<DOMAIN>/login`

    b. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<DOMAIN>/login/acs/<ID>`

1. If you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode, then perform the following step:

    In the **Sign on URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<DOMAIN>/login`

    > [!NOTE]
    > These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Sign on URL. Contact [Illumio SSO Client support team](mailto:support@illumio.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section.

1. Your Illumio SSO application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows an example for this. The default value of **Unique User Identifier** is **user.userprincipalname** but Illumio SSO expects this to be mapped with the user's email address. For that you can use **user.mail** attribute from the list or use the appropriate attribute value based on your organization configuration.
    
    ![Screenshot shows the image of attributes configuration.](common/default-attributes.png "Image")

1. In addition to above, Illumio SSO application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response, which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.

	| Name |  Source Attribute|
	| ---------------|  --------- |
    | User.MemberOf | user.assignedroles |

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Certificate (Base64)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

    ![Screenshot shows the Certificate download link.](common/certificatebase64.png "Certificate")

1. On the **Set up Illumio SSO** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

	![Screenshot shows to copy configuration appropriate URL.](common/copy-configuration-urls.png "Metadata")

## Configure Illumio SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Illumio SSO** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [Illumio SSO support team](mailto:support@illumio.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Illumio SSO test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon at Illumio SSO. Work with [Illumio SSO support team](mailto:support@illumio.com) to add the users in the Illumio SSO platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

1. Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Illumio SSO Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

1. Go to Illumio SSO Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

1. Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Illumio SSO for which you set up the SSO. 

1. You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the Illumio SSO tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign-on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Illumio SSO for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

## Next steps

Once you configure Illumio SSO you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

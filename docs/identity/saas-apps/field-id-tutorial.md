# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with Field iD

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Field iD with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Field iD with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Field iD.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed in to Field iD with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location: the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* A Field iD single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Field iD supports IDP initiated SSO.

## Add Field iD from the gallery

To configure the integration of Field iD into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Field iD from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Field iD** in the search box.
1. Select **Field iD** from results panel, and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Field iD

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Field iD by using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a linked relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Field iD.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Field iD, complete the following steps:

1. [Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso) to enable your users to use this feature.
   1. [Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user) to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
   1. [Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user) to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. [Configure Field iD SSO](#configure-field-id-sso) to configure the single sign-on settings on the application side.
   1. [Create a Field iD test user](#create-a-field-id-test-user) to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Field iD, linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of the user.
1. [Test SSO](#test-sso) to verify whether the configuration works.

### Assign the Microsoft Entra test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use single sign-on by granting access to Field iD.

1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Field iD**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section, and select **Users and groups**.

1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog box, select **Assign**.

## Configure Field iD SSO

To configure single sign-on on Field iD side, send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to the [Field iD support team](mailto:support@ecompliance.com). They ensure that the SAML SSO connection is set properly on both sides.

### Create a Field iD test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Field iD. Work with the [Field iD support team](mailto:support@ecompliance.com) to add the users in the Field iD platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Field iD for which you set up the SSO.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Field iD tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the Field iD for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

## Next steps

Once you configure Field iD you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

# Configure Podbean for Single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID

In this article,  you learn how to integrate Podbean with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Podbean with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Podbean.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Podbean with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites
The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

[!INCLUDE [common-prerequisites.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/common-prerequisites.md)]
* Podbean single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Podbean supports **SP** initiated SSO

* Podbean supports **Just In Time** user provisioning

## Adding Podbean from the gallery

To configure the integration of Podbean into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Podbean from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Podbean** in the search box.
1. Select **Podbean** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Podbean SSO](#configure-podbean-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Podbean test user](#create-podbean-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Podbean that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.

### Create Podbean test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in Podbean. Podbean supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Podbean, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

1. Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to Podbean Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

2. Go to Podbean Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

3. You can use Microsoft Access Panel. When you select the Podbean tile in the Access Panel, this option redirects to Podbean Sign-on URL. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

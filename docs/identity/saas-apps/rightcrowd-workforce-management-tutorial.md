# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) integration with RightCrowd Workforce Management

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate RightCrowd Workforce Management with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate RightCrowd Workforce Management with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to RightCrowd Workforce Management.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to RightCrowd Workforce Management with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* RightCrowd Workforce Management single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.



* RightCrowd Workforce Management supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO

## Adding RightCrowd Workforce Management from the gallery

To configure the integration of RightCrowd Workforce Management into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add RightCrowd Workforce Management from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **RightCrowd Workforce Management** in the search box.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure RightCrowd Workforce Management SSO](#configure-rightcrowd-workforce-management-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create RightCrowd Workforce Management test user](#create-rightcrowd-workforce-management-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in RightCrowd Workforce Management that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure RightCrowd Workforce Management SSO

To configure single sign-on on **RightCrowd Workforce Management** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [RightCrowd Workforce Management support team](mailto:info@rightcrowd.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create RightCrowd Workforce Management test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in RightCrowd Workforce Management. RightCrowd Workforce Management supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in RightCrowd Workforce Management, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to RightCrowd Workforce Management Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to RightCrowd Workforce Management Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the RightCrowd Workforce Management for which you set up the SSO 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the RightCrowd Workforce Management tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the RightCrowd Workforce Management for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).


## Next steps

Once you configure RightCrowd Workforce Management you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

# Configure Workware for Single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID

In this article,  you learn how to integrate Workware with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Workware with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Workware.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Workware with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites
The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

[!INCLUDE [common-prerequisites.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/common-prerequisites.md)]
* Workware single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Workware supports **IDP** initiated SSO.

## Add Workware from the gallery

To configure the integration of Workware into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Workware from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Workware** in the search box.
1. Select **Workware** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Workware SSO](#configure-workware-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Workware test user](#create-workware-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Workware that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.

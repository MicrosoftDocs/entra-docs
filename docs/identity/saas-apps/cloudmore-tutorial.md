## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Cloudmore

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Cloudmore using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Cloudmore.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Cloudmore, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    * **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    * **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Cloudmore SSO](#configure-cloudmore-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    * **[Create Cloudmore test user](#create-cloudmore-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Cloudmore that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **Cloudmore** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, the user doesn't have to perform any step as the app is already pre-integrated with Azure.

1. Select **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type the URL:
    `https://www.cloudmore.com`

1. Select **Save**.

1. Cloudmore application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

1. In addition to above, Cloudmore application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.

	| Name | Source Attribute|
	| ---------------| --------------- |
	| Test_name | user.companyname |
	| Mail | user.userprincipalname |

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, In the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, select copy button to copy **App Federation Metadata Url** and save it on your computer.

## Configure Cloudmore SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Cloudmore** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [Cloudmore support team](mailto:platformsupport@cloudmore.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Cloudmore test user

In this section, you create a user called B.Simon in Cloudmore. Work with [Cloudmore support team](mailto:platformsupport@cloudmore.com) to add the users in the Cloudmore platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to Cloudmore Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Cloudmore Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Cloudmore for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the Cloudmore tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Cloudmore for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

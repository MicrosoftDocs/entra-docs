[!INCLUDE [common-prerequisites.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/common-prerequisites.md)]
* Beeline Enterprise single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* Beeline Enterprise supports **SP** and **IDP** initiated SSO.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Beeline Enterprise

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Beeline Enterprise using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Beeline Enterprise.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Beeline Enterprise, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Beeline Enterprise SSO](#configure-beeline-enterprise-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Beeline Enterprise test user](#create-beeline-enterprise-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Beeline that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **Beeline Enterprise** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Screenshot shows how to edit Basic SAML Configuration.](common/edit-urls.png "Basic Configuration")

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a value using the following pattern:
    `urn:auth0:<Auth0TenantName>:<CustomerName>-SSO`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern: 
    `https://<Auth0TenantName>.<Auth0Environment>.beeline.com/login/callback?connection=<CustomerName>-SSO`

1. Perform the following step, if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    In the **Sign on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<Environment>.beeline.com/<CustomerName>/security/auth0/auth0spinitiatedssohandler.ashx`

    > [!NOTE]
    > These values aren't real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Sign on URL. Contact [Beeline Enterprise support team](mailto:support@beeline.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section.

1. Select **Save**.

1. The Beeline Enterprise application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format. Please work with [Beeline Enterprise support team](mailto:support@beeline.com) first to identify the correct user identifier which is mapped into the application. Also please take the guidance from [Beeline Enterprise support team](mailto:support@beeline.com) about the attribute which they want to use for this mapping. You can manage the value of this attribute from the **User Attributes** tab of the application. The following screenshot shows an example for this. Here we have mapped the **User Identifier** claim with the **userprincipalname** attribute, which provides unique user ID, which is sent to the Beeline Enterprise application in every successful SAML response.

    ![Screenshot shows the image of default attributes.](common/edit-attribute.png "Image")

1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **Beeline Enterprise** > **Manage** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, find **Certificate (Base64)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

	![Screenshot shows the Certificate download link.](common/certificatebase64.png "Certificate")

1. In the **Set up Beeline Enterprise** section, copy the **Login URL** and **Logout URL**.

## Configure Beeline Enterprise SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Beeline Enterprise** side, you need to send the following items that you gathered from a step earlier in this article to the [Beeline Enterprise support team](mailto:support@beeline.com). They will configure single sign-on on the **Beeline Enterprise** side.

* **Certificate (Base64)**
* **Login URL**
* **Logout URL**

### Create Beeline Enterprise test user

In this section, you create a user, Britta Simon, in Beeline Enterprise. The Beeline Enterprise application needs all users to be provisioned in the application before doing Single Sign On. So work with the [Beeline Enterprise support team](mailto:support@beeline.com) to provision all these users into the application.

## Test SSO

In this section, you have two different ways to test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration.

* Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **Beeline Enterprise** > **Manage** > **Single sign-on**. Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Beeline Enterprise for which you set up the SSO.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the **Beeline Enterprise** tile in **My Apps**, you should be automatically signed in to the Beeline Enterprise site for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps portal, see [Introduction to the My Apps portal](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

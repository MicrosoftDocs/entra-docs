1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Amplitude SSO](#configure-amplitude-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Amplitude test user](#create-amplitude-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Amplitude that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Create Amplitude test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in Amplitude. Amplitude supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Amplitude, a new one is created after authentication.

> [!Note]
> If you need to create a user manually, contact [Amplitude support team](https://amplitude.zendesk.com).

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to Amplitude Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Amplitude Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Amplitude for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the Amplitude tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Amplitude for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

# Tutorial: Configure Peakon for automatic user provisioning

The objective of this tutorial is to demonstrate the steps to be performed in Peakon  and Microsoft Entra ID to configure Microsoft Entra ID to automatically provision and de-provision users and/or groups to Peakon.

> [!NOTE]
>  This tutorial describes a connector built on top of the Microsoft Entra user provisioning service. For important details on what this service does, how it works, and frequently asked questions, see [Automate user provisioning and deprovisioning to SaaS applications with Microsoft Entra ID](~/identity/app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md).
>
> This connector is currently in Preview. For more information about previews, see [Universal License Terms For Online Services](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/product/ForOnlineServices/all).

## Prerequisites

The scenario outlined in this tutorial assumes that you already have the following prerequisites

* A Microsoft Entra tenant.
* [A Peakon tenant](https://www.workday.com/en-us/products/employee-voice/overview.html).
* A user account in Peakon  with Admin permissions.

> [!NOTE]
> This integration is also available to use from Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud environment. You can find this application in the Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud Application Gallery and configure it in the same way as you do from public cloud.

## Assigning users to Peakon

Microsoft Entra ID uses a concept called *assignments* to determine which users should receive access to selected apps. In the context of automatic user provisioning, only the users and/or groups that have been assigned to an application in Microsoft Entra ID are synchronized.

Before configuring and enabling automatic user provisioning, you should decide which users and/or groups in Microsoft Entra ID need access to Peakon. Once decided, you can assign these users and/or groups to Peakon by following the instructions here:

* [Assign a user or group to an enterprise app](~/identity/enterprise-apps/assign-user-or-group-access-portal.md)

## Important tips for assigning users to Peakon 

* It is recommended that a single Microsoft Entra user is assigned to Peakon  to test the automatic user provisioning configuration. Additional users and/or groups may be assigned later.

* When assigning a user to Peakon, you must select any valid application-specific role (if available) in the assignment dialog. Users with the **Default Access** role are excluded from provisioning.

## Set up Peakon for provisioning

1.  Sign in to your [Peakon Admin Console](https://app.Peakon.com/login). Click on **Configuration**.

2. 	Select **Integrations**.

3.	Enable **Employee Provisioning**.

	![Screenshot of the Employee Provisioning section with the Enable option called out.](media/Peakon-provisioning-tutorial/peakon05.png)

4.	Copy the values for **SCIM 2.0 URL** and **OAuth Bearer Token**. These values will be entered in the **Tenant URL** and **Secret Token** field in the Provisioning tab of your Peakon application.

## Add Peakon from the gallery

To configuring Peakon  for automatic user provisioning with Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Peakon  from the Microsoft Entra application gallery to your list of managed SaaS applications.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Peakon**, select **Peakon** in the search box.
1. Select **Peakon** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configuring automatic user provisioning to Peakon 

This section guides you through the steps to configure the Microsoft Entra provisioning service to create, update, and disable users and/or groups in Peakon  based on user and/or group assignments in Microsoft Entra ID.

> [!TIP]
> You may also choose to enable SAML-based single sign-on for Peakon, following the instructions provided in the [Peakon Single sign-on tutorial](peakon-tutorial.md). Single sign-on can be configured independently of automatic user provisioning, though these two features complement each other.

### To configure automatic user provisioning for Peakon  in Microsoft Entra ID:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications**

	![Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

1. In the applications list, select **Peakon**.

	![The Peakon  link in the Applications list](common/all-applications.png)

3. Select the **Provisioning** tab.

	![Screenshot of the Manage options with the Provisioning option called out.](common/provisioning.png)

4. Set the **Provisioning Mode** to **Automatic**.

	![Screenshot of the Provisioning Mode dropdown list with the Automatic option called out.](common/provisioning-automatic.png)

5. Under the **Admin Credentials** section, input the **SCIM 2.0 URL** and **OAuth Bearer Token** values retrieved earlier in **Tenant URL** and **Secret Token** respectively. Click **Test Connection** to ensure Microsoft Entra ID can connect to Peakon. If the connection fails, ensure your Peakon account has Admin permissions and try again.

	![Tenant URL + Token](common/provisioning-testconnection-tenanturltoken.png)

7. In the **Notification Email** field, enter the email address of a person or group who should receive the provisioning error notifications and check the checkbox - **Send an email notification when a failure occurs**.

	![Notification Email](common/provisioning-notification-email.png)

8. Click **Save**.

9. Under the **Mappings** section, select **Synchronize Microsoft Entra users to Peakon**.

	![Peakon User Mappings](media/Peakon-provisioning-tutorial/Peakon-user-mappings.png)

10. Review the user attributes that are synchronized from Microsoft Entra ID to Peakon  in the **Attribute Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the user accounts in Peakon  for update operations. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.

	![Peakon User Attributes](media/Peakon-provisioning-tutorial/Peakon-user-attributes.png)

12. To configure scoping filters, refer to the following instructions provided in the 		[Scoping filter tutorial](~/identity/app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).
	
	![Provisioning Scope](common/provisioning-scope.png)

15. When you are ready to provision, click **Save**.

	![Saving Provisioning Configuration](common/provisioning-configuration-save.png)

This operation starts the initial synchronization of all users and/or groups defined in **Scope** in the **Settings** section. The initial sync takes longer to perform than subsequent syncs, which occur approximately every 40 minutes as long as the Microsoft Entra provisioning service is running. You can use the **Synchronization Details** section to monitor progress and follow links to provisioning activity report, which describes all actions performed by the Microsoft Entra provisioning service on Peakon.

For more information on how to read the Microsoft Entra provisioning logs, see [Reporting on automatic user account provisioning](~/identity/app-provisioning/check-status-user-account-provisioning.md).

## Connector limitations

* All custom user attributes in Peakon have to be extended from Peakon's custom SCIM user extension of `urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:peakon:2.0:User`.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Microsoft Entra ID with my.sdworx.com, you need:

* Before adding the application in your Microsoft Entra tenant, please contact your SD Worx consultant first to start up the track to activate the SSO for your company. The SSO won’t work before it's implemented and activated on the SD Worx Service Provider.
* A Microsoft Entra user account. If you don't already have one, you can [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* One of the following roles: Global Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator, or owner of the service principal.
* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* my.sdworx.com single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Add application and assign a test user

Before you begin the process of configuring single sign-on, you need to add the my.sdworx.com application from the Microsoft Entra gallery. You need a test user account to assign to the application and test the single sign-on configuration.

### Add my.sdworx.com from the Microsoft Entra gallery

Add my.sdworx.com from the Microsoft Entra application gallery to configure single sign-on with my.sdworx.com. For more information on how to add application from the gallery, see the [Quickstart: Add application from the gallery](~/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal.md).

## Configure my.sdworx.com SSO

To configure single sign-on on **my.sdworx.com** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [my.sdworx.com support team](mailto:prod_cloud&busoper_middleware&hostsol@sdworx.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create my.sdworx.com test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon at my.sdworx.com. Work with [my.sdworx.com support team](mailto:prod_cloud&busoper_middleware&hostsol@sdworx.com) to add the users in the my.sdworx.com platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the my.sdworx.com for which you set up the SSO.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the my.sdworx.com tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the my.sdworx.com for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

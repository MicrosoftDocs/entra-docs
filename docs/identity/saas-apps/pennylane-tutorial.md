# Microsoft Entra SSO integration with Pennylane

In this article, you'll learn how to integrate Pennylane with Microsoft Entra ID. Access your company's financial data easily and in real time. Reduce the time spent on your accounting, limit manual actions, back and forth with your accountant. When you integrate Pennylane with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Pennylane.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Pennylane with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

You'll configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on for Pennylane in a test environment. Pennylane supports only **SP** initiated single sign-on.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Microsoft Entra ID with Pennylane, you need:

* A Microsoft Entra user account. If you don't already have one, you can [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* One of the following roles: Global Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator, or owner of the service principal.
* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Pennylane single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Add application and assign a test user

Before you begin the process of configuring single sign-on, you need to add the Pennylane application from the Microsoft Entra gallery. You need a test user account to assign to the application and test the single sign-on configuration.

### Add Pennylane from the Microsoft Entra gallery

### Create and assign Microsoft Entra test user

Follow the guidelines in the [create and assign a user account](~/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal-assign-users.md) article to create a test user account called B.Simon.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, and assign roles. The wizard also provides a link to the single sign-on configuration pane.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Complete the following steps to enable Microsoft Entra single sign-on.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **Pennylane** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Screenshot shows how to edit Basic SAML Configuration.](common/edit-urls.png "Basic Configuration")

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** textbox, type the value:
    `pennylane`

    b. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type the URL:
    `https://app.pennylane.com/auth/saml/callback`

    c. In the **Sign on URL** textbox, type the URL:
    `https://app.pennylane.com/auth/login`

1. Pennylane application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![Screenshot shows the image of attributes configuration.](common/default-attributes.png "Image")

1. In addition to above, Pennylane application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response, which are shown. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.

	| Name |  Source Attribute|
	| ---------------|  --------- |
    | email | user.mail |

1. On the **Set-up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Certificate (Base64)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

    ![Screenshot shows the Certificate download link.](common/certificatebase64.png "Certificate")

1. On the **Set up Pennylane** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

	![Screenshot shows to copy configuration appropriate URL.](common/copy-configuration-urls.png "Metadata")

## Configure Pennylane SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Pennylane** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [Pennylane support team](mailto:key-accounts-tech@pennylane.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Pennylane test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon at Pennylane. Work with [Pennylane support team](mailto:key-accounts-tech@pennylane.com) to add the users in the Pennylane platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Pennylane Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Pennylane Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the Pennylane tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Pennylane Sign-on URL. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

## Next steps

Once you configure Pennylane you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

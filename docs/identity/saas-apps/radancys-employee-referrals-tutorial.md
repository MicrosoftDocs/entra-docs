### Create Radancy's Employee Referrals test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in Radancy's Employee Referrals. Radancy's Employee Referrals supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Radancy's Employee Referrals, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to Radancy's Employee Referrals Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Radancy's Employee Referrals Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Radancy's Employee Referrals for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the Radancy's Employee Referrals tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign-on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Radancy's Employee Referrals for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

# Microsoft Entra SSO integration with Fleet Management System

In this article, you learn how to integrate Fleet Management System with Microsoft Entra ID. Manages and monitors a fleet of surface level vehicles and subterranean tugs and carts that Microsoft utilizes. When you integrate Fleet Management System with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Fleet Management System.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Fleet Management System with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

You'll configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on for Fleet Management System in a test environment. Fleet Management System supports **IDP** initiated single sign-on.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Microsoft Entra ID with Fleet Management System, you need:

* A Microsoft Entra user account. If you don't already have one, you can [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* One of the following roles: [Application Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#application-administrator), [Cloud Application Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#cloud-application-administrator), or [Application Owner](/entra/fundamentals/users-default-permissions#owned-enterprise-applications).
* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Fleet Management System single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Add application and assign a test user

Before you begin the process of configuring single sign-on, you need to add the Fleet Management System application from the Microsoft Entra gallery. You need a test user account to assign to the application and test the single sign-on configuration.

### Add Fleet Management System from the Microsoft Entra gallery

Add Fleet Management System from the Microsoft Entra application gallery to configure single sign-on with Fleet Management System. For more information on how to add application from the gallery, see the [Quickstart: Add application from the gallery](~/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal.md).

### Create and assign Microsoft Entra test user

Follow the guidelines in the [create and assign a user account](~/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal-assign-users.md) article to create a test user account called B.Simon.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, and assign roles. The wizard also provides a link to the single sign-on configuration pane.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Complete the following steps to enable Microsoft Entra single sign-on.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **Fleet Management System** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** textbox, type one of the following URLs:

    | Environment | URL |
    |----|----|
    | Production| `https://msfms.net/SAMLFms` |
    | Staging | `https://test.msfms.net/SAMLFms`|

    b. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type one of the following URLs:

    | Environment | URL |
    |----|----|
    | Production| `https://msfms.net/saml2/acs` |
    | Staging | `https://test.msfms.net/saml2/acs`|

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, find **Certificate (Base64)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

	![Screenshot shows to copy configuration appropriate URL.](common/copy-configuration-urls.png "Metadata")

## Configure Fleet Management System SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Fleet Management System** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [Fleet Management System support team](mailto:msfms-support@navagis.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Fleet Management System test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon at Fleet Management System. Work with [Fleet Management System support team](mailto:msfms-support@navagis.com) to add the users in the Fleet Management System platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Fleet Management System for which you set up the SSO.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Fleet Management System tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the Fleet Management System for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

## Next steps

Once you configure Fleet Management System you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

# Configure iLOGON_MHA for Single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID

In this article,  you learn how to integrate iLOGON_MHA with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate iLOGON_MHA with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

To complete the OAuth/OIDC federation setup on **iLOGON_MHA** side, you need to send the copied values like Tenant ID, Application ID, and Client Secret from Entra to [iLOGON_MHA support team](mailto:support@keyfields.com). They set this setting to have the OIDC connection set properly on both sides.

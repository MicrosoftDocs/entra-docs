# Tutorial: Configure Maptician for automatic user provisioning

This tutorial describes the steps you need to perform in both Maptician and Microsoft Entra ID to configure automatic user provisioning. When configured, Microsoft Entra ID automatically provisions and de-provisions users and groups to [Maptician](https://www.maptician.com) using the Microsoft Entra provisioning service. For important details on what this service does, how it works, and frequently asked questions, see [Automate user provisioning and deprovisioning to SaaS applications with Microsoft Entra ID](~/identity/app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md). 


## Capabilities Supported
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create users in Maptician
> * Remove users in Maptician when they do not require access anymore
> * Keep user attributes synchronized between Microsoft Entra ID and Maptician
> * [Single sign-on](maptician-tutorial.md) to Maptician (recommended).

## Prerequisites

The scenario outlined in this tutorial assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

* [A Microsoft Entra tenant](~/identity-platform/quickstart-create-new-tenant.md) 
* One of the following roles: [Application Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#application-administrator), [Cloud Application Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#cloud-application-administrator), or [Application Owner](/entra/fundamentals/users-default-permissions#owned-enterprise-applications). 
* A [Maptician](https://www.maptician.com) tenant.
* A user account in Maptician with Admin permissions.

## Step 1: Plan your provisioning deployment
1. Learn about [how the provisioning service works](~/identity/app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md).
1. Determine who will be in [scope for provisioning](~/identity/app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).
1. Determine what data to [map between Microsoft Entra ID and Maptician](~/identity/app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes.md).

## Step 2: Configure Maptician to support provisioning with Microsoft Entra ID


You can begin the process of connecting your Maptician environment to Microsoft Entra provisioning and single sign-on (SSO) by reaching out to the Maptician support team <support@maptician.com> or directly with your Maptician account manager. You will be provided a document that will contain your  **Tenant URL**, along with a **Secret Token**. Maptician support team members can assist you with setting up this integration and are available to answer any questions about its configuration or use.

## Step 3: Add Maptician from the Microsoft Entra application gallery

Add Maptician from the Microsoft Entra application gallery to start managing provisioning to Maptician. If you have previously setup Maptician for SSO, you can use the same application. However it is recommended that you create a separate app when testing out the integration initially. Learn more about adding an application from the gallery [here](~/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal.md). 

## Step 4: Define who will be in scope for provisioning 

The Microsoft Entra provisioning service allows you to scope who will be provisioned based on assignment to the application and or based on attributes of the user / group. If you choose to scope who will be provisioned to your app based on assignment, you can use the following [steps](~/identity/enterprise-apps/assign-user-or-group-access-portal.md) to assign users and groups to the application. If you choose to scope who will be provisioned based solely on attributes of the user or group, you can use a scoping filter as described [here](~/identity/app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md). 

* Start small. Test with a small set of users and groups before rolling out to everyone. When scope for provisioning is set to assigned users and groups, you can control this by assigning one or two users or groups to the app. When scope is set to all users and groups, you can specify an [attribute based scoping filter](~/identity/app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).

* If you need additional roles, you can [update the application manifest](~/identity-platform/howto-add-app-roles-in-apps.md) to add new roles.


## Step 5: Configure automatic user provisioning to Maptician 

This section guides you through the steps to configure the Microsoft Entra provisioning service to create, update, and disable users and/or groups in Maptician based on user and/or group assignments in Microsoft Entra ID.

### To configure automatic user provisioning for Maptician in Microsoft Entra ID:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications**

	![Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

1. In the applications list, select **Maptician**.

	![The Maptician link in the Applications list](common/all-applications.png)

1. Select the **Provisioning** tab.

	![Provisioning tab](common/provisioning.png)

1. Set the **Provisioning Mode** to **Automatic**.

	![Provisioning tab automatic](common/provisioning-automatic.png)

1. In the **Admin Credentials** section, input your Maptician **Tenant URL** and **Secret Token**. Click **Test Connection** to ensure Microsoft Entra ID can connect to Maptician. If the connection fails, ensure your Maptician account has Admin permissions and try again.

	![Token](common/provisioning-testconnection-tenanturltoken.png)

1. In the **Notification Email** field, enter the email address of a person or group who should receive the provisioning error notifications and select the **Send an email notification when a failure occurs** check box.

	![Notification Email](common/provisioning-notification-email.png)

1. Select **Save**.

1. In the **Mappings** section, select **Synchronize Microsoft Entra users to Maptician**.

1. Review the user attributes that are synchronized from Microsoft Entra ID to Maptician in the **Attribute-Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the user accounts in Maptician for update operations. If you choose to change the [matching target attribute](~/identity/app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes.md), you will need to ensure that the Maptician API supports filtering users based on that attribute. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.

   |Attribute|Type|Supported for filtering|
   |---|---|---|
   |userName|String|&check;
   |emails[type eq "work"].value|String|
   |active|Boolean|
   |title|String|
   |userType|String|
   |name.givenName|String|
   |name.familyName|String|
   |addresses[type eq "work"].locality|String|
   |addresses[type eq "work"].region|String|
   |phoneNumbers[type eq "work"].value|String|
   |phoneNumbers[type eq "mobile"].value|String|
   |externalId|String|
   |urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:enterprise:2.0:User:employeeNumber|String|
   |urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:enterprise:2.0:User:organization|String|
   |urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:enterprise:2.0:User:department|String|

1. To configure scoping filters, refer to the following instructions provided in the [Scoping filter tutorial](~/identity/app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).

1. To enable the Microsoft Entra provisioning service for Maptician, change the **Provisioning Status** to **On** in the **Settings** section.

	![Provisioning Status Toggled On](common/provisioning-toggle-on.png)

1. Define the users and/or groups that you would like to provision to Maptician by choosing the desired values in **Scope** in the **Settings** section.

	![Provisioning Scope](common/provisioning-scope.png)

1. When you are ready to provision, click **Save**.

	![Saving Provisioning Configuration](common/provisioning-configuration-save.png)

This operation starts the initial synchronization cycle of all users and groups defined in **Scope** in the **Settings** section. The initial cycle takes longer to perform than subsequent cycles, which occur approximately every 40 minutes as long as the Microsoft Entra provisioning service is running. 

## Step 6: Monitor your deployment
Once you've configured provisioning, use the following resources to monitor your deployment:

* Use the [provisioning logs](~/identity/monitoring-health/concept-provisioning-logs.md) to determine which users have been provisioned successfully or unsuccessfully
* Check the [progress bar](~/identity/app-provisioning/application-provisioning-when-will-provisioning-finish-specific-user.md) to see the status of the provisioning cycle and how close it is to completion
* If the provisioning configuration seems to be in an unhealthy state, the application will go into quarantine. Learn more about quarantine states [here](~/identity/app-provisioning/application-provisioning-quarantine-status.md).

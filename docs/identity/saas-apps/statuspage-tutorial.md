## Scenario description

In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* StatusPage supports **IDP** initiated SSO.

## Add StatusPage from the gallery

To configure the integration of StatusPage into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add StatusPage from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).

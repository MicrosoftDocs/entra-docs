# Tutorial: Configure Brivo Onair Identity Connector for automatic user provisioning

The objective of this tutorial is to demonstrate the steps to be performed in Brivo Onair Identity Connector and Microsoft Entra ID to configure Microsoft Entra ID to automatically provision and de-provision users and/or groups to Brivo Onair Identity Connector.

> [!NOTE]
> This tutorial describes a connector built on top of the Microsoft Entra user Provisioning Service. For important details on what this service does, how it works, and frequently asked questions, see [Automate user provisioning and deprovisioning to SaaS applications with Microsoft Entra ID](~/identity/app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md).

## Prerequisites

The scenario outlined in this tutorial assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

* A Microsoft Entra tenant
* [A Brivo Onair Identity Connector tenant](https://www.brivo.com/lp/quote)
* A user account in Brivo Onair Identity Connector with Senior Administrator permissions.

## Assigning users to Brivo Onair Identity Connector

Microsoft Entra ID uses a concept called *assignments* to determine which users should receive access to selected apps. In the context of automatic user provisioning, only the users and/or groups that have been assigned to an application in Microsoft Entra ID are synchronized.

Before configuring and enabling automatic user provisioning, you should decide which users and/or groups in Microsoft Entra ID need access to Brivo Onair Identity Connector. Once decided, you can assign these users and/or groups to Brivo Onair Identity Connector by following the instructions here:
* [Assign a user or group to an enterprise app](~/identity/enterprise-apps/assign-user-or-group-access-portal.md)

## Important tips for assigning users to Brivo Onair Identity Connector

* It is recommended that a single Microsoft Entra user is assigned to Brivo Onair Identity Connector to test the automatic user provisioning configuration. Additional users and/or groups may be assigned later.

* When assigning a user to Brivo Onair Identity Connector, you must select any valid application-specific role (if available) in the assignment dialog. Users with the **Default Access** role are excluded from provisioning.

## Setup Brivo Onair Identity Connector for provisioning

1. Sign in to your [Brivo Onair Identity Connector Admin Console](https://acs.brivo.com/login/). Navigate to **Account > Account Settings**.

3. Click on **Copy Token** button and save the **Secret Token**. This value will be entered in the Secret Token field in the Provisioning tab of your Brivo Onair Identity Connector application.

    ![Provisioning Status Toggled On](common/provisioning-toggle-on.png)

14. Define the users and/or groups that you would like to provision to Brivo Onair Identity Connector by choosing the desired values in **Scope** in the **Settings** section.

    ![Provisioning Scope](common/provisioning-scope.png)

15. When you are ready to provision, click **Save**.

    ![Saving Provisioning Configuration](common/provisioning-configuration-save.png)

This operation starts the initial synchronization of all users and/or groups defined in **Scope** in the **Settings** section. The initial sync takes longer to perform than subsequent syncs, which occur approximately every 40 minutes as long as the Microsoft Entra provisioning service is running. You can use the **Synchronization Details** section to monitor progress and follow links to provisioning activity report, which describes all actions performed by the Microsoft Entra provisioning service on Brivo Onair Identity Connector.

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure ContractS CLM SSO](#configure-contracts-clm-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create ContractS CLM test user](#create-contracts-clm-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in ContractS CLM that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.

## Configure ContractS CLM SSO

To configure single sign-on on the **ContractS CLM** side, you need to register the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and the appropriate copied URLs on the ContractS CLM Admin page. 

### Create ContractS CLM test user

In this section, you create a user called B.Simon in ContractS CLM. You can create/invite a user on the ContractS CLM Member Management page. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to ContractS CLM Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to ContractS CLM Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the ContractS CLM for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the ContractS CLM tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the ContractS CLM for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

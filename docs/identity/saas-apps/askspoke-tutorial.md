1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure askSpoke SSO](#configure-askspoke-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create askSpoke test user](#create-askspoke-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in askSpoke that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Create askSpoke test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in askSpoke. askSpoke supports just-in-time provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in askSpoke, a new one is created when you attempt to access askSpoke.

askSpoke also supports automatic user provisioning, you can find more details [here](./askspoke-provisioning-tutorial.md) on how to configure automatic user provisioning.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to askspoke Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to askspoke Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the askspoke for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the askspoke tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign-on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the askspoke for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

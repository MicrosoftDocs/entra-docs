# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra integration with TOPdesk - Public

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate TOPdesk - Public with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate TOPdesk - Public with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to TOPdesk - Public.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to TOPdesk - Public with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* TOPdesk - Public single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* TOPdesk - Public supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Add TOPdesk - Public from the gallery

To configure the integration of TOPdesk - Public into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add TOPdesk - Public from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **TOPdesk - Public** in the search box.
1. Select **TOPdesk - Public** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for TOPdesk - Public

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with TOPdesk - Public using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in TOPdesk - Public.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with TOPdesk - Public, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure TOPdesk - Public SSO](#configure-topdesk---public-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create TOPdesk - Public test user](#create-topdesk---public-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in TOPdesk - Public that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **TOPdesk - Public** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

4.	On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you have **Service Provider metadata file**, perform the following steps:

	>[!NOTE]
	>You will get the **Service Provider metadata file** from the **Configure TOPdesk - Public Single Sign-On** section which is explained later in the tutorial.

	a. Click **Upload metadata file**.
	
	![Upload metadata file](common/upload-metadata.png)

	b. Click on **folder logo** to select the metadata file and click **Upload**.

	![choose metadata file](common/browse-upload-metadata.png)

	c. After the metadata file is successfully uploaded, the **Identifier** and **Reply URL** values get auto populated in Basic SAML Configuration section.

    d. In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<companyname>.topdesk.net`

	e. In the **Identifier URL** textbox, fill in the TOPdesk metadata URL that you can retrieve from the TOPdesk configuration. It should use the following pattern: `https://<companyname>.topdesk.net/saml-metadata/<identifier>`

    `https://<companyname>.topdesk.net/tas/public/login/verify`
	
	> [!NOTE]

For Identifier, follow the pattern as mentioned above and you get Reply URL value from the **Configure TOPdesk - Public Single Sign-On** section which is explained later in the tutorial. The **Sign-on URL** value is not real, so you need to update the value with the actual Sign-On URL. Contact [TOPdesk - Public Client support team](https://my.topdesk.com/) to get the value. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section.

1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Federation Metadata XML** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure TOPdesk - Public you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

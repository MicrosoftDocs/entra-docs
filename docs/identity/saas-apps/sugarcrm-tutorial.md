# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) integration with Sugar CRM

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Sugar CRM with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Sugar CRM with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Sugar CRM.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Sugar CRM with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Sugar CRM single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Sugar CRM supports **SP** initiated SSO

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add Sugar CRM from the gallery

To configure the integration of Sugar CRM into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Sugar CRM from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Sugar CRM** in the search box.
1. Select **Sugar CRM** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Sugar CRM

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Sugar CRM using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Sugar CRM.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Sugar CRM, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Sugar CRM SSO](#configure-sugar-crm-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Sugar CRM test user](#create-sugar-crm-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Sugar CRM that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Sugar CRM tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Sugar CRM Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure Sugar CRM you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

    a. In the **Sign on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<subdomain>.sabacloud.com/Saba/Web/<company code>`

    b. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<subdomain>.sabacloud.com/Saba/saml/SSO/alias/<company name>`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values aren't real. Update these values with the actual Sign on URL and Identifier. Contact [Learning at Work Client support team](https://www.learninga-z.com/site/contact/support) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section.

5. Learning at Work application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes, whereas **nameidentifier** is mapped with **user.userprincipalname**.

	You can update the **nameidentifier** value in Microsoft Entra ID based on your Organization setup and this value needs to match with the **User ID** in the SABA cloud, for that you need to edit the attribute mapping by selecting **pencil** icon and change the attribute mapping.

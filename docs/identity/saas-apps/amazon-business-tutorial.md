## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Amazon Business

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Amazon Business using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Amazon Business.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Amazon Business, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Amazon Business SSO](#configure-amazon-business-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Amazon Business test user](#create-amazon-business-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Amazon Business that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **Amazon Business** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

    ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you wish to configure in **IDP** initiated mode, perform the following steps:

    1. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** text box, type one of the following URLs:

       | URL | Region |
       |-|-|
       | `https://www.amazon.com`| North America |
       | `https://www.amazon.co.jp`| East Asia |
       | `https://www.amazon.de`| Europe |

    1. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using one of the following patterns:

       | URL | Region |
       |-|-|
       | `https://www.amazon.com/bb/feature/sso/action/3p_redirect?idpid={idpid}`| North America |
       | `https://www.amazon.co.jp/bb/feature/sso/action/3p_redirect?idpid={idpid}`| East Asia |

### Create Amazon Business test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in Amazon Business. Amazon Business supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Amazon Business, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to Amazon Business Sign-on URL where you can initiate the sign-in flow.  

* Go to the Amazon Business Single Sign-on URL directly and initiate the sign-in flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Amazon Business for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the Amazon Business tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign-on page for initiating the sign-in flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Amazon Business for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

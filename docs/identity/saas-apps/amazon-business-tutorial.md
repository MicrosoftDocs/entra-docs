# Tutorial: Integrate Amazon Business with Microsoft Entra ID

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Amazon Business with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Amazon Business with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Amazon Business.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Amazon Business with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* An Amazon Business single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription. Go to the [Amazon Business](https://www.amazon.com/business/register/org/landing?ref_=ab_reg_mlp) page to create an Amazon Business account.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in an existing Amazon Business account.

* Amazon Business supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.
* Amazon Business supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.
* Amazon Business supports [Automated user provisioning](amazon-business-provisioning-tutorial.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add Amazon Business from the gallery

To configure the integration of Amazon Business into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Amazon Business from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Amazon Business** in the search box.
1. Select **Amazon Business** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Amazon Business

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Amazon Business using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Amazon Business.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Amazon Business, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Amazon Business SSO](#configure-amazon-business-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Amazon Business test user](#create-amazon-business-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Amazon Business that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **Amazon Business** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

    ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you wish to configure in **IDP** initiated mode, perform the following steps:

    1. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** text box, type one of the following URLs:

       | URL | Region |
       |-|-|
       | `https://www.amazon.com`| North America |
       | `https://www.amazon.co.jp`| East Asia |
       | `https://www.amazon.de`| Europe |

    1. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using one of the following patterns:

       | URL | Region |
       |-|-|
       | `https://www.amazon.com/bb/feature/sso/action/3p_redirect?idpid={idpid}`| North America |
       | `https://www.amazon.co.jp/bb/feature/sso/action/3p_redirect?idpid={idpid}`| East Asia |
       | `https://www.amazon.de/bb/feature/sso/action/3p_redirect?idpid={idpid}`| Europe |

       > [!NOTE]
       > The Reply URL value is not real. Update this value with the actual Reply URL. You will get the `<idpid>` value from the Amazon Business SSO configuration section, which is explained later in the tutorial. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section.

1. If you want to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode, you will need to add the full URL provided in the Amazon Business configuration to the **Sign-on URL** in the **Set additional URLs** section.

1. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes. Edit the attributes by clicking on the **pencil** icon in the **User Attributes & Claims** section.

### Create Amazon Business test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in Amazon Business. Amazon Business supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Amazon Business, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Amazon Business Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to the Amazon Business Single Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Amazon Business for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the Amazon Business tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign-on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Amazon Business for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure Amazon Business you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

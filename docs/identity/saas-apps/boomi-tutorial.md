## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Boomi

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Boomi using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Boomi.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Boomi, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    * **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    * **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Boomi SSO](#configure-boomi-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    * **[Create Boomi test user](#create-boomi-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Boomi that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **Boomi** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you have **Service Provider metadata file** and wish to configure in **IDP** initiated mode, perform the following steps:

	a. Select **Upload metadata file**.

    ![Upload metadata file](common/upload-metadata.png)

	b. Select **folder logo** to select the metadata file and select **Upload**.

	> [!Note]
	> You get the **Service Provider metadata file** from the **Configure Boomi SSO** section, which is explained later in the article. If the **Identifier** and **Reply URL** values don't get auto populated, then fill in the values manually according to your requirement.

1. Boomi application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![Screenshot shows User Attributes & Claims with default values such as Givenname user.givenname and Emailaddress User.mail.](common/default-attributes.png)

1. In addition to above, Boomi application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.

	| Name |  Source Attribute|
	| ---------------|  --------- |
	| FEDERATION_ID | user.mail |

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Certificate (Base64)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

	h. Select **Save** button.

### Create Boomi test user

In order to enable Microsoft Entra users to sign in to Boomi, they must be provisioned into Boomi. In the case of Boomi, provisioning is a manual task.

### To provision a user account, perform the following steps:

1. Sign in to your Boomi company site as an administrator.

1. After logging in, navigate to **User Management** ->**Users**.

1. Select **+**  icon and the **Add/Maintain User Roles** dialog opens.

	![Screenshot shows the + icon selected.](./media/boomi-tutorial/add.png "Users")

	a. In the **User e-mail address** textbox, type the email of user like B.Simon@contoso.com.

	b. In the **First name** textbox, type the First name of user like B.

	c. In the **Last name** textbox, type the Last name of user like Simon.

	d. Enter the user's **Federation ID**. Each user must have a Federation ID that uniquely identifies the user within the account.

	e. Assign the **Standard User** role to the user. don't assign the Administrator role because that would give them normal Atmosphere access and single sign-on access.

	f. Select **OK**.

	> [!NOTE]
	> The user doesn't receive a welcome notification email containing a password that can be used to log in to the AtomSphere account because their password is managed through the identity provider. You may use any other Boomi user account creation tools or APIs provided by Boomi to provision Microsoft Entra user accounts.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Boomi for which you set up the SSO.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the Boomi tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the Boomi for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

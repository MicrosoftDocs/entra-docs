# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with GitHub Enterprise Cloud - Enterprise Account

In this tutorial, you learn how to setup a Microsoft Entra SAML integration with a GitHub Enterprise Cloud - Enterprise Account. When you integrate GitHub Enterprise Cloud - Enterprise Account with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to a GitHub Enterprise Account and any organizations within the Enterprise Account.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* A [GitHub Enterprise Account](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/overview/about-enterprise-accounts).
* A GitHub user account that is an Enterprise Account owner. 

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you will configure a SAML integration for a GitHub Enterprise Account, and test enterprise account owner and enterprise/organization member authentication and access. 

> [!NOTE]
> The GitHub `Enterprise Cloud - Enterprise Account` application does not support enabling [automatic SCIM provisioning](~/architecture/sync-scim.md). If you need to setup provisioning for your GitHub Enterprise Cloud environment, SAML must be configured at the organization level and the `GitHub Enterprise Cloud - Organization` Microsoft Entra application must be used instead. If you are setting up a SAML and SCIM provisioning integration for an enterprise that is enabled for [Enterprise Managed Users (EMUs)](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-enterprise-managed-users-for-iam/about-enterprise-managed-users), then you must use the `GitHub Enterprise Managed User` Microsoft Entra application for SAML/Provisioning integrations or the `GitHub Enterprise Managed User (OIDC)` Microsoft Entra application for OIDC/Provisioning integrations.

* GitHub Enterprise Cloud - Enterprise Account supports **SP** and **IDP** initiated SSO.

## Adding GitHub Enterprise Cloud - Enterprise Account from the gallery

To configure the integration of GitHub Enterprise Cloud - Enterprise Account into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add GitHub Enterprise Cloud - Enterprise Account from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **GitHub Enterprise Cloud - Enterprise Account** in the search box.
1. Select **GitHub Enterprise Cloud - Enterprise Account** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Enable and Test SAML for the Enterprise Account and its organizations

To configure single sign-on on the **GitHub Enterprise Cloud - Enterprise Account** side, follow the steps listed in [this GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-policies-for-security-settings-in-your-enterprise#enabling-saml-single-sign-on-for-organizations-in-your-enterprise-account). 
1. Sign in to GitHub.com with a user account that is an [enterprise account owner](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/user-management/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/roles-in-an-enterprise#enterprise-owner). 
1. Copy the value from the `Login URL` field in the app and paste it in the `Sign on URL` field in the GitHub Enterprise Account SAML settings. 
1. Copy the value from the `Azure AD Identifier` field in the app and paste it in the `Issuer` field in the GitHub Enterprise Account SAML settings. 
1. Copy the contents of the **Certificate (Base64)** file you downloaded in the steps above from Azure portal and paste them in the appropriate field in the GitHub Enterprise Account SAML settings. 
1. Click the `Test SAML configuration` and confirm that you are able to authenticate from the GitHub Enterprise Account to Microsoft Entra ID successfully.
1. Once the test is successful, save the settings. 
1. After authenticating via SAML for the first time from the GitHub enterprise account, a _linked external identity_ will be created in the GitHub enterprise account that associates the signed in GitHub user account with the Microsoft Entra user account.  
 
After you enable SAML SSO for your GitHub Enterprise Account, SAML SSO is enabled by default for all organizations owned by your Enterprise Account. All members will be required to authenticate using SAML SSO to gain access to the organizations where they are a member, and enterprise owners will be required to authenticate using SAML SSO when accessing an Enterprise Account.

## Test SSO with another enterprise account owner or organization member account

After the SAML integration is set up for the GitHub enterprise account (which also applies to the GitHub organizations in the enterprise account), other enterprise account owners who are assigned to the app in Microsoft Entra ID should be able to navigate to the GitHub enterprise account URL (`https://github.com/enterprises/<enterprise account>`), authenticate via SAML, and access the policies and settings under the GitHub enterprise account. 

An organization owner for an organization in an enterprise account should be able to [invite a user to join their GitHub organization](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/inviting-users-to-join-your-organization). Sign in to GitHub.com with an organization owner account and follow the steps in the article to invite `B.Simon` to the organization. A GitHub user account will need to be created for `B.Simon` if one does not already exist. 

To test GitHub organization access under the Enterprise Account with the `B.Simon` test user account:
1. Invite `B.Simon` to an organization under the Enterprise Account as an organization owner. 
1. Sign in to GitHub.com using the user account you would like to link to the `B.Simon` Microsoft Entra user account.
1. Sign in to Microsoft Entra ID using the `B.Simon` user account.
1. Go to the GitHub organization. The user should be prompted to authenticate via SAML. After successful SAML authentication, `B.Simon` should be able to access organization resources. 

## Next steps

Once you configure GitHub Enterprise Cloud - Enterprise Account you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

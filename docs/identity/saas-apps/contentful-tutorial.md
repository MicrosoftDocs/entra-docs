1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Contentful** in the search box.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Contentful

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Contentful using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Contentful.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Contentful, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Contentful SSO](#configure-contentful-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Contentful test user](#create-contentful-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Contentful that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **Contentful** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. In the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you want to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, perform the following step:

    a. In the **Reply URL** text box, copy the ACS (Assertion Consumer Service) URL from the SSO setup page in Contentful. It will look like this:
    `https://be.contentful.com/sso/<organization_id>/consume`.

1. Select **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you want to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    a. In the **Sign-on URL** text box, copy the same ACS (Assertion Consumer Service) URL. It will look like this:
    `https://be.contentful.com/sso/<organization_id>/login`.

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values aren't real. Update these values with the actual Reply URL and Sign-On URL by copying the ACS (Assertion Consumer Service) URL from the SSO setup page in Contentful.

1. Contentful application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![image](common/default-attributes.png)

1. In addition to above, Contentful application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.
	
	| Name |  Source Attribute|
	| --------------- | --------- |
	| email | user.userprincipalname |

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, find **Certificate (Base64)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

[!INCLUDE [create-assign-users-sso.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/create-assign-users-sso.md)]

## Configure Contentful SSO

Follow these steps to configure single sign-on on the **Contentful** side.

1. In [Contentful](https://app.contentful.com), navigate to the SSO setup page in **Organization Settings**.
1. Select **Set up SSO**.
1. Copy and paste the login URL from the **Set up Contentful** section in Microsoft Entra ID.
1. Copy and paste the certificate from the Base64 certificate file you downloaded from Microsoft Entra ID.
1. Set up an SSO name for SP-initiated login.
1. Select **Enable SSO**.

If that doesn't work, reach out to the [Contentful support team](mailto:support@contentful.com).

### Create Contentful test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in Contentful. Contentful supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Contentful, a new one is created after authentication.

Contentful also supports automatic user provisioning, you can find more details [here](./contentful-provisioning-tutorial.md) on how to configure automatic user provisioning.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to Contentful Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Contentful Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Contentful for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the Contentful tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Contentful for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Businessmap

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Businessmap using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Businessmap.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Businessmap, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Businessmap SSO](#configure-businessmap-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Businessmap test user](#create-businessmap-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Businessmap that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **Businessmap** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, perform the following steps:

     a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<subdomain>.kanbanize.com/`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<subdomain>.kanbanize.com/saml/acs`

	c. Select **Set additional URLs**.

    d. In the **Relay State** textbox, type the value: `/ctrl_login/saml_login`

1. Select **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<subdomain>.kanbanize.com`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values aren't real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL, and Sign-on URL. Contact [Businessmap Client support team](mailto:support@businessmap.io) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section.

1. Businessmap application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes, whereas nameidentifier is mapped with **user.userprincipalname**. Businessmap application expects nameidentifier to be mapped with **user.mail**, so you need to edit the attribute mapping by selecting Edit icon and change the attribute mapping.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Certificate (Base64)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

### Create Businessmap test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in Businessmap. Businessmap supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Businessmap, a new one is created after authentication. If you need to create a user manually, contact [Businessmap Client support team](mailto:support@businessmap.io).

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to Businessmap Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Businessmap Sign-on URL directly and initiate the sign-in flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Businessmap for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the Businessmap tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign-on page for initiating the sign-in flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Businessmap for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

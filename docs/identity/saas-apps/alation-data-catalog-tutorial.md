## Configure Alation Data Catalog SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Alation Data Catalog** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from Microsoft Entra admin center to [Alation Data Catalog support team](mailto:support-all@alation.com ). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Alation Data Catalog test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in Alation Data Catalog. Alation Data Catalog supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Alation Data Catalog, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.
 
#### SP initiated:
 
* Select **Test this application** in Microsoft Entra admin center. This option redirects to Alation Data Catalog Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  
 
* Go to Alation Data Catalog Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.
 
#### IDP initiated:
 
* Select **Test this application** in Microsoft Entra admin center and you should be automatically signed in to the Alation Data Catalog for which you set up the SSO.
 
You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the Alation Data Catalog tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign-on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Alation Data Catalog for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

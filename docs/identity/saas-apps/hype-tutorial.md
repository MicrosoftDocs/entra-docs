1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Hype SSO](#configure-hype-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Hype test user](#create-hype-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Hype that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.

## Configure Hype SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Hype** side, you need to send the downloaded **Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [Hype support team](mailto:itsupport@hype.de). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Hype test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in Hype. Hype supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Hype, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to Hype Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Hype Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the Hype tile in the My Apps, this option redirects to Hype Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

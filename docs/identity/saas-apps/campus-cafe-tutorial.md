# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with Campus Café

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Campus Café with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Campus Café with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Campus Café.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Campus Café with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Campus Café single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Campus Café supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Add Campus Café from the gallery

To configure the integration of Campus Café into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Campus Café from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Campus Café** in the search box.
1. Select **Campus Café** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Campus Café

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Campus Café using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Campus Café.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Campus Café, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Campus Café SSO](#configure-campus-cafe-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Campus Café test user](#create-campus-cafe-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Campus Café that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Campus Cafe SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Campus Café** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [Campus Café support team](mailto:support@campuscafesoftware.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Campus Cafe test user

In this section, you create a user called B.Simon in Campus Café. Work with [Campus Café support team](mailto:support@campuscafesoftware.com) to add the users in the Campus Café platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Campus Cafe Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Campus Cafe Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Campus Cafe tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Campus Cafe Sign-on URL. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

## Next steps

Once you configure Campus Cafe you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

# Microsoft Entra SSO integration with Terranova Security Awareness Platform

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Terranova Security Awareness Platform with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Terranova Security Awareness Platform with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Terranova Security Awareness Platform.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Terranova Security Awareness Platform with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Microsoft Entra ID with Terranova Security Awareness Platform, you need:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Terranova Security Awareness Platform single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Terranova Security Awareness Platform supports both **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add Terranova Security Awareness Platform from the gallery

To configure the integration of Terranova Security Awareness Platform into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Terranova Security Awareness Platform from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Terranova Security Awareness Platform** in the search box.
1. Select **Terranova Security Awareness Platform** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Terranova Security Awareness Platform

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Terranova Security Awareness Platform using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Terranova Security Awareness Platform.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Terranova Security Awareness Platform, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-microsoft-entra-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-a-microsoft-entra-id-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-microsoft-entra-id-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Terranova Security Awareness Platform SSO](#configure-terranova-security-awareness-platform-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Terranova Security Awareness Platform test user](#create-terranova-security-awareness-platform-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Terranova Security Awareness Platform that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO in the Microsoft Entra admin center.

   1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Terranova Security Awareness Platform SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Terranova Security Awareness Platform** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from Microsoft Entra admin center to [Terranova Security Awareness Platform support team](mailto:support.terranova@helpsystems.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Terranova Security Awareness Platform test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in Terranova Security Awareness Platform. Work withÂ [Terranova Security Awareness Platform support team](mailto:support.terranova@helpsystems.com) to add the users in the Terranova Security Awareness platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.
 
#### SP initiated
 
* Click on **Test this application** in Microsoft Entra admin center. This will redirect to Terranova Security Awareness Platform Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  
 
* Go to Terranova Security Awareness Platform Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.
 
#### IDP initiated
 
* Click on **Test this application** in Microsoft Entra admin center and you should be automatically signed in to the Terranova Security Awareness Platform for which you set up the SSO.
 
You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the Terranova Security Awareness Platform tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign-on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Terranova Security Awareness Platform for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure Terranova Security Awareness Platform you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization's sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

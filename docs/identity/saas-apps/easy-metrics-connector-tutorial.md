# Microsoft Entra SSO integration with Easy Metrics Connector

In this article, you learn how to integrate Easy Metrics Connector with Microsoft Entra ID. This application is a bridge between Microsoft Entra ID and Auth0, federating Authentication to Microsoft Entra ID for our customers. When you integrate Easy Metrics Connector with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Easy Metrics Connector.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Easy Metrics Connector with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

You configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on for Easy Metrics Connector in a test environment. Easy Metrics Connector supports only **SP** initiated single sign-on.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Microsoft Entra ID with Easy Metrics Connector, you need:

* A Microsoft Entra user account. If you don't already have one, you can [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* One of the following roles: Global Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator, or owner of the service principal.
* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Easy Metrics Connector single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Add application and assign a test user

Before you begin the process of configuring single sign-on, you need to add the Easy Metrics Connector application from the Microsoft Entra gallery. You need a test user account to assign to the application and test the single sign-on configuration.

### Add Easy Metrics Connector from the Microsoft Entra gallery

### Create and assign Microsoft Entra test user

Follow the guidelines in the [create and assign a user account](~/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal-assign-users.md) article to create a test user account called B.Simon.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, and assign roles. The wizard also provides a link to the single sign-on configuration pane.

1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **Easy Metrics Connector** > **Single sign-on**.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

	b. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type the value provided by [Easy Metrics Connector support team](mailto:support@easymetrics.com).

	c. In the **Sign on URL** textbox, type the value provided by [Easy Metrics Connector support team](mailto:support@easymetrics.com).

## Configure Easy Metrics Connector SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Easy Metrics Connector** side, you need to send the **Certificate (PEM)** to [Easy Metrics Connector support team](mailto:support@easymetrics.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Easy Metrics Connector test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Easy Metrics Connector. Work with [Easy Metrics Connector support team](mailto:support@easymetrics.com) to add the users in the Easy Metrics Connector platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Easy Metrics Connector Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Easy Metrics Connector Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Easy Metrics Connector tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Easy Metrics Connector Sign-on URL. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

* [Plan a single sign-on deployment](~/identity/enterprise-apps/plan-sso-deployment.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Easy Metrics Connector you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

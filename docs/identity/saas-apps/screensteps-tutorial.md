# Configure ScreenSteps for Single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID

In this article,  you learn how to integrate ScreenSteps with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate ScreenSteps with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to ScreenSteps.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to ScreenSteps with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites
The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

[!INCLUDE [common-prerequisites.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/common-prerequisites.md)]
* ScreenSteps single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* ScreenSteps supports **SP** initiated SSO.
* ScreenSteps supports [Automated user provisioning](screensteps-provisioning-tutorial.md).

## Add ScreenSteps from the gallery

To configure the integration of ScreenSteps into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add ScreenSteps from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **ScreenSteps** in the search box.
1. Select **ScreenSteps** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.

### Create ScreenSteps test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in ScreenSteps. Work with [ScreenSteps Client support team](https://www.screensteps.com/contact) to add the users in the ScreenSteps platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Switch to the **Testing and Activation** tab in ScreenSteps.

* Select the **Save & Copy** button to copy the **SAML Test URL** to the clipboard.

* Open an Incognito browser window and paste the URL in.

* Sign in with the `B.Simon@contoso.com` test user you created in the previous step. You should be granted access to ScreenSteps and `B.Simon@contoso.com` should appear in the list of Users in ScreenSteps.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the ScreenSteps tile in the My Apps, this option redirects to ScreenSteps Sign-on URL. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with ScreenSteps

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate ScreenSteps with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate ScreenSteps with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to ScreenSteps.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to ScreenSteps with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* ScreenSteps single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* ScreenSteps supports **SP** initiated SSO.
* ScreenSteps supports [Automated user provisioning](screensteps-provisioning-tutorial.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add ScreenSteps from the gallery

To configure the integration of ScreenSteps into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add ScreenSteps from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **ScreenSteps** in the search box.
1. Select **ScreenSteps** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for ScreenSteps

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with ScreenSteps using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in ScreenSteps.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with ScreenSteps, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure ScreenSteps SSO](#configure-screensteps-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create ScreenSteps test user](#create-screensteps-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in ScreenSteps that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Create ScreenSteps test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in ScreenSteps. Work with [ScreenSteps Client support team](https://www.screensteps.com/contact) to add the users in the ScreenSteps platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to ScreenSteps Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to ScreenSteps Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the ScreenSteps tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to ScreenSteps Sign-on URL. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

## Next steps

Once you configure ScreenSteps you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

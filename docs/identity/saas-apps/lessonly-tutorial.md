# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with Lessonly

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Lessonly with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Lessonly with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Lessonly.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Lessonly with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Lessonly single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Lessonly supports **SP** initiated SSO.
* Lessonly supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Add Lessonly from the gallery

To configure the integration of Lessonly into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Lessonly from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Lessonly** in the search box.
1. Select **Lessonly** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Lessonly

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Lessonly using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Lessonly.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Lessonly, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Lessonly SSO](#configure-lessonly-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Lessonly test user](#create-lessonly-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Lessonly that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **Lessonly** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, enter the values for the following fields:

    a. In the **Sign on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<companyname>.lessonly.com/auth/saml`

	> [!NOTE]
	> When referencing a generic name that **companyname** needs to be replaced by an actual name.
	
    b. In the **Reply URL (Assertion Customer Service URL)** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<companyname>.lessonly.com/auth/saml/callback`

    c. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<companyname>.lessonly.com/auth/saml/metadata`
    
	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Sign on URL, Reply URL, and Identifier. Contact [Lessonly.com Client support team](mailto:support@lessonly.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section.

1. Lessonly application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![image](common/default-attributes.png)

1. In addition to above, Lessonly application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.

    | Name | Source Attribute|
	| ---------------  | ----------------|
	| urn:oid:2.5.4.42 | user.givenname |
	| urn:oid:2.5.4.4  | user.surname |
	| urn:oid:0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.3 | user.mail |
	| urn:oid:1.3.6.1.4.1.5923.1.1.1.10 | user.objectid |

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Certificate (Base64)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

1. On the **Set up Lessonly** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

### Assign the Microsoft Entra test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use single sign-on by granting access to Lessonly.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **Lessonly**.
1. In the app's overview page, select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user/group**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
   1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
   1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
   1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Lessonly SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Lessonly** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [Lessonly support team](mailto:support@lessonly.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Lessonly test user

The objective of this section is to create a user called B.Simon in Lessonly.com. Lessonly.com supports just-in-time provisioning, which is by default enabled.

There is no action item for you in this section. A new user will be created during an attempt to access Lessonly.com if it doesn't exist yet.

> [!NOTE]
> If you need to create a user manually, you need to contact the [Lessonly.com support team](mailto:support@lessonly.com).

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Lessonly Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Lessonly Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Lessonly tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Lessonly Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure Lessonly you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

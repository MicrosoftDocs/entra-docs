# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with SkyDesk Email

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate SkyDesk Email with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate SkyDesk Email with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to SkyDesk Email.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to SkyDesk Email with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* SkyDesk Email single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* SkyDesk Email supports **SP** initiated SSO.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add SkyDesk Email from the gallery

To configure the integration of SkyDesk Email into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add SkyDesk Email from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **SkyDesk Email** in the search box.
1. Select **SkyDesk Email** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure SkyDesk Email SSO](#configure-skydesk-email-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create SkyDesk Email test user](#create-skydesk-email-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in SkyDesk Email that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.

# Microsoft Entra SSO integration with Insightsfirst

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Insightsfirst with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Insightsfirst with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Insightsfirst.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Insightsfirst with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Microsoft Entra ID with Insightsfirst, you need:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Insightsfirst single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Insightsfirst supports **SP** initiated SSO.
* Insightsfirst supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Adding Insightsfirst from the gallery

To configure the integration of Insightsfirst into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Insightsfirst from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Insightsfirst** in the search box.
1. Select **Insightsfirst** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Insightsfirst

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Insightsfirst using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Insightsfirst.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Insightsfirst, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-microsoft-entra-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra ID test user](#create-a-microsoft-entra-id-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra ID test user](#assign-the-microsoft-entra-id-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Insightsfirst SSO](#configure-insightsfirst-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Insightsfirst test user](#create-insightsfirst-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Insightsfirst that is linked to the Microsoft Entra ID representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO in the Microsoft Entra admin center.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **Insightsfirst** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** textbox, type one of the following URLs:

    | **Identifier** |
    |------------|
    | `https://insightsfirst-implementation.evalueserve.com` |
    | `https://insightsfirst.evalueserve.com/` |

    b. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type one of the following URLs:

    | **Reply URL** |
    |------------|
    | `https://insightsfirst-implementation.evalueserve.com/InsightFirstSSO/api/Assertion/ConsumerService` |
    | `https://insightsfirst.evalueserve.com/InsightFirstSSO/api/Assertion/ConsumerService` |

	c. In the **Sign on URL** textbox, type one of the following URLs:

   1. Select **Review + create**.
1. Select **Create**.

### Assign the Microsoft Entra ID test user

In this section, you enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on by granting access to Insightsfirst.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).

   1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Insightsfirst SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Insightsfirst** side, you need to send the **Thumbprint Value** and appropriate copied URLs from Microsoft Entra admin center to [Insightsfirst support team](mailto:insightsfirst.support@evalueserve.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Insightsfirst test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in Insightsfirst. Insightsfirst supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Insightsfirst, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.
 
* Click on **Test this application** in Microsoft Entra admin center. This will redirect to Insightsfirst Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow.
 
* Go to Insightsfirst Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.
 
* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Insightsfirst tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Insightsfirst Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next Steps

Once you configure Insightsfirst you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization's sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

# Microsoft Entra SSO integration with TechSafe Entra ID SSO

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate TechSafe Entra ID SSO with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate TechSafe Entra ID SSO with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to TechSafe Entra ID SSO.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to TechSafe Entra ID SSO with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Microsoft Entra ID with TechSafe Entra ID SSO, you need:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* TechSafe Entra ID SSO single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* TechSafe Entra ID SSO supports only **SP** initiated SSO.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add TechSafe Entra ID SSO from the gallery

To configure the integration of TechSafe Entra ID SSO into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add TechSafe Entra ID SSO from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **TechSafe Entra ID SSO** in the search box.
1. Select **TechSafe Entra ID SSO** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

* Click on **Test this application** in Microsoft Entra admin center. This will redirect to TechSafe Entra ID SSO Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow.
 
* Go to TechSafe Entra ID SSO Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.
 
* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the TechSafe Entra ID SSO tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to TechSafe Entra ID SSO Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure TechSafe Entra ID SSO you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization's sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra integration with Workspot Control

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Workspot Control with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Workspot Control with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Workspot Control.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Workspot Control with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To configure Microsoft Entra integration with Workspot Control, you need the following things:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a Microsoft Entra environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

* A Workspot Control single sign-on-enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* Workspot Control supports SP-initiated and IDP-initiated SSO.

## Add Workspot Control from the gallery

To configure the integration of Workspot Control into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Workspot Control from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Workspot Control** in the search box.
1. Select **Workspot Control** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Workspot Control

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Workspot Control using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Workspot Control.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Workspot Control, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Workspot Control SSO](#configure-workspot-control-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Workspot Control test user](#create-workspot-control-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Workspot Control that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Workspot Control Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Workspot Control Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Workspot Control for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the Workspot Control tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Workspot Control for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure Workspot Control you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

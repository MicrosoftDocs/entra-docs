## Configure GitHub Enterprise Managed User SSO

To configure single sign-on on **GitHub Enterprise Managed User** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from Microsoft Entra admin center to [GitHub Enterprise Managed User support team](https://support.github.com/early-access/data-residency). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create GitHub Enterprise Managed User test user

In this section, you create a user called B.Simon in GitHub Enterprise Managed User. Work withÂ [GitHub Enterprise Managed User support team](https://support.github.com/early-access/data-residency) to add the users in the GitHub Enterprise Managed User platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.
 
#### SP initiated:
 
* Select **Test this application** in Microsoft Entra admin center. this option redirects to GitHub Enterprise Managed User Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  
 
* Go to GitHub Enterprise Managed User Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.
 
#### IDP initiated:
 
* Select **Test this application** in Microsoft Entra admin center and you should be automatically signed in to the GitHub Enterprise Managed User for which you set up the SSO.
 
You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the GitHub Enterprise Managed User tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign-on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the GitHub Enterprise Managed User for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Configure Capriza Platform SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Capriza Platform** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [Capriza Platform support team](mailto:support@capriza.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Capriza Platform test user

The objective of this section is to create a user called Britta Simon in Capriza. Capriza supports just-in-time provisioning, which is by default enabled. **Please make sure that your domain name is configured with Capriza for user provisioning. After that only the just-in-time user provisioning will work.**

There's no action item for you in this section. A new user is created during an attempt to access Capriza if it doesn't exist yet.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to Capriza Platform Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Capriza Platform Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the Capriza Platform tile in the My Apps, this option redirects to Capriza Platform Sign-on URL. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

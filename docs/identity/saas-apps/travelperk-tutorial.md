# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with TravelPerk

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate TravelPerk with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate TravelPerk with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to TravelPerk.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to TravelPerk with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* A TravelPerk account with Premium subscription.
* Along with Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator can also add or manage applications in Microsoft Entra ID.
For more information, see [Azure built-in roles](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md).

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* TravelPerk supports **SP** initiated SSO.

* TravelPerk supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

* TravelPerk supports [Automated user provisioning](travelperk-provisioning-tutorial.md).

## Add TravelPerk from the gallery

To configure the integration of TravelPerk into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add TravelPerk from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **TravelPerk** in the search box.
1. Select **TravelPerk** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for TravelPerk

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with TravelPerk using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in TravelPerk.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with TravelPerk, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure TravelPerk SSO](#configure-travelperk-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create TravelPerk test user](#create-travelperk-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in TravelPerk that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **TravelPerk** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Screenshot shows to edit Basic S A M L Configuration.](common/edit-urls.png "Basic Configuration")

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<COMPANY>.travelperk.com/accounts/saml2/metadata/<APPLICATION_ID>`

	b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<COMPANY>.travelperk.com/accounts/saml2/callback/<APPLICATION_ID>/?acs`

    c. In the **Sign on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<COMPANY>.travelperk.com/`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Sign on URL. The values can be found inside your TravelPerk account: go to **Company Settings** > **Integrations** > **Single Sign On**. For assistance, visit the [TravelPerk helpcenter](https://support.travelperk.com/hc/articles/360052450271-How-can-I-setup-SSO-for-Azure-SAML).

1. Your TravelPerk application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes. In the default mapping, **emailaddress** is mapped with **user.mail**. However, the TravelPerk application expects **emailaddress** to be mapped with **user.userprincipalname**. For TravelPerk, you must edit the attribute mapping: click the **Edit** icon, and then change the attribute mapping. To edit an attribute, just click the attribute to open edit mode.

	![Screenshot shows the image of TravelPerk application.](common/default-attributes.png "Attributes")

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

	![Screenshot shows the Certificate download link.](common/metadataxml.png "Certificate")

1. On the **Set up TravelPerk** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

   1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure TravelPerk SSO

To configure single sign-on on **TravelPerk** side, you need to set up the integration in the TravelPerk app.

1. Go to https://app.travelperk.com as an Admin user, and under **Account Settings** > **Integrations** open **Single sign-on (SSO)**.

1. Select **SAML** as the option, and click **New Integration** then perform the following steps:

    a. In the **IdP entity ID** textbox, paste the **Microsoft Entra Identifier** value which you copied previously.

    b. In the **IdP SSO service URL** textbox, paste the **Login URL** value which you copied previously.

    c. In the **IdP x509 cert** textbox, paste the **Federation Metadata XML** file (Without the X509Certificate tag).

    d. Save and proceed with the testing.

### Create TravelPerk test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in TravelPerk. TravelPerk supports just-in-time provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in TravelPerk, a new one is created when you attempt to access TravelPerk.

TravelPerk also supports automatic user provisioning, you can find more details [here](./travelperk-provisioning-tutorial.md) on how to configure automatic user provisioning.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to TravelPerk Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to TravelPerk Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the TravelPerk tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to TravelPerk Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure TravelPerk you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

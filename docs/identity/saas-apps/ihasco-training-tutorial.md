# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) integration with iHASCO Training

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate iHASCO Training with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate iHASCO Training with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to iHASCO Training.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to iHASCO Training with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* iHASCO Training single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* iHASCO Training supports **SP** initiated SSO.
* iHASCO Training supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.


## Adding iHASCO Training from the gallery

To configure the integration of iHASCO Training into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add iHASCO Training from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **iHASCO Training** in the search box.
1. Select **iHASCO Training** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

### Create iHASCO Training test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in iHASCO Training. iHASCO Training supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in iHASCO Training, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to iHASCO Training Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to iHASCO Training Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the iHASCO Training tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to iHASCO Training Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).


## Next steps

Once you configure iHASCO Training you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) integration with Segment

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Segment with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Segment with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Segment.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Segment with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Segment single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Segment supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.
* Segment supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.
* Segment supports [Automated user provisioning](segment-provisioning-tutorial.md).

## Add Segment from the gallery

To configure the integration of Segment into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Segment from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Segment** in the search box.
1. Select **Segment** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Segment

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Segment using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Segment.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Segment, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Segment SSO](#configure-segment-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Segment test user](#create-segment-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Segment that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, perform the following steps:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type the URL:
    `https://app.segment.com`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are placeholders. You need to use the actual Identifier and Reply URL. Steps for getting these values are described later in this tutorial.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Certificate (Base64)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

### Create Segment test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in Segment. Segment supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Segment, a new one is created after authentication.

Segment also supports automatic user provisioning, you can find more details [here](./segment-provisioning-tutorial.md) on how to configure automatic user provisioning.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Segment Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Segment Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Segment for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the Segment tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Segment for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure Segment you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for IBM Digital Business Automation on Cloud

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with IBM Digital Business Automation on Cloud using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in IBM Digital Business Automation on Cloud.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with IBM Digital Business Automation on Cloud, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure IBM Digital Business Automation on Cloud SSO](#configure-ibm-digital-business-automation-on-cloud-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create IBM Digital Business Automation on Cloud test user](#create-ibm-digital-business-automation-on-cloud-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in IBM Digital Business Automation on Cloud that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure IBM Digital Business Automation on Cloud SSO

To configure single sign-on on **IBM Digital Business Automation on Cloud** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [IBM Digital Business Automation on Cloud support team](mailto:supportbpmoncloud@us.ibm.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create IBM Digital Business Automation on Cloud test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in IBM Digital Business Automation on Cloud. Work with [IBM Digital Business Automation on Cloud support team](mailto:supportbpmoncloud@us.ibm.com) to add the users in the IBM Digital Business Automation on Cloud platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to IBM Digital Business Automation on Cloud Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to IBM Digital Business Automation on Cloud Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the IBM Digital Business Automation on Cloud for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the IBM Digital Business Automation on Cloud tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the IBM Digital Business Automation on Cloud for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

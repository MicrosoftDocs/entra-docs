# Customer intent: As an IT administrator, I want to learn how to configure single sign-on between Microsoft Entra ID and OfficeSpace Software so that I can control who has access to OfficeSpace Software, enable automatic sign-in with Microsoft Entra accounts, and manage my accounts in one central location.

# Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) integration with OfficeSpace Software

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* OfficeSpace Software single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for OfficeSpace Software

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with OfficeSpace Software using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in OfficeSpace Software.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with OfficeSpace Software, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure OfficeSpace Software SSO](#configure-officespace-software-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **OfficeSpace Software** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

	a. In the **Sign on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<company name>.officespacesoftware.com/users/sign_in/saml`

    b. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `<company name>.officespacesoftware.com`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values aren't real. Update these values with the actual Sign-on URL and Identifier. Contact the [OfficeSpace Software Client support team](mailto:support@officespacesoftware.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section.

1. OfficeSpace Software application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes, whereas **nameidentifier** is mapped with **user.userprincipalname**. OfficeSpace Software application expects **nameidentifier** to be mapped with **user.mail**, so you need to edit the attribute mapping by clicking on **Edit** icon and change the attribute mapping.

	![image](common/edit-attribute.png)

1. In addition to above, OfficeSpace Software application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response which are shown below. These attributes are also prepopulated but you can review them as per your requirement.

	| Name | Source Attribute|
	| ---------------| --------------- |
	| email | user.mail |
	| name | user.displayname |
	| first_name | user.givenname |
	| last_name | user.surname |

1. In the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, select **Edit** button to open **SAML Signing Certificate** dialog.

	![Edit SAML Signing Certificate](common/edit-certificate.png)

1. In the **SAML Signing Certificate Section**, download the PEM certificate.

    ![PEM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c0e4fa7-1c4a-4a62-aa1b-a45bc06b1afd)

1. In the **Set up OfficeSpace Software** section, copy one or more appropriate URLs based on your requirement.

### Create OfficeSpace Software test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in OfficeSpace Software. OfficeSpace Software supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in OfficeSpace Software, a new one is created after authentication.

> [!NOTE]
> If you need to create a user manually, you need to Contact [OfficeSpace Software support team](mailto:support@officespacesoftware.com).

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Select on **Test this application**, this will redirect to OfficeSpace Software Sign-on URL where you can initiate the sign-in flow. 

* Go to OfficeSpace Software Sign-on URL directly and initiate the sign-in flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the OfficeSpace Software tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to OfficeSpace Software Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

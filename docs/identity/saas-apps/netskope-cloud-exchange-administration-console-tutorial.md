## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Complete the following steps to enable Microsoft Entra single sign-on.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **Netskope Cloud Exchange Administration Console** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Screenshot shows how to edit Basic SAML Configuration.](common/edit-urls.png "Basic Configuration")

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

	a. In the **Identifier** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
	`https://<Cloud_Exchange_FQDN>/api/metadata`

    b. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<Cloud_Exchange_FQDN>/api/ssoauth?acs=true`

	c. In the **Sign on URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
	`https://<Cloud_Exchange_FQDN>/login`

	> [!NOTE]
    > These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Sign on URL based on your cloud exchange deployment. You can also contact [Netskope Cloud Exchange Administration Console support team](mailto:support@netskope.com) to get help to determine these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section.

1. Netskope Cloud Exchange Administration Console application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![Screenshot shows the image of attributes configuration.](common/default-attributes.png "Image")

1. In addition to above, Netskope Cloud Exchange Administration Console application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response, which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.

	| Name |  Source Attribute|
	| ---------------|  --------- |
	| username | user.mail |
	| roles | user.assignedroles |

To configure single sign-on on **Netskope Cloud Exchange Administration Console** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [Netskope Cloud Exchange Administration Console support team](mailto:support@netskope.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides

### Create Netskope Cloud Exchange Administration Console test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon at Netskope Cloud Exchange Administration Console SSO. Work with [Netskope Cloud Exchange Administration Console support team](mailto:support@netskope.com) to add the users in the Netskope Cloud Exchange Administration Console SSO platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Netskope Cloud Exchange Administration Console Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Netskope Cloud Exchange Administration Console Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

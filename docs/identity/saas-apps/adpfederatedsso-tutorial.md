# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with ADP

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate ADP with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate ADP with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to ADP.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to ADP with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* ADP single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> This integration is also available to use from Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud environment. You can find this application in the Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud Application Gallery and configure it in the same way as you do from public cloud.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* ADP supports **IDP** initiated SSO.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add ADP from the gallery

To configure the integration of ADP into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add ADP from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **ADP** in the search box.
1. Select **ADP** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for ADP

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with ADP using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in ADP.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with ADP, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
2. **[Configure ADP SSO](#configure-adp-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create ADP test user](#create-adp-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in ADP that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
3. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

1. **Save** your changes.

1. Upon receipt of confirmation from your ADP representative, begin test with one or two users.

    1. Assign few users to the ADP service App to test federated access.

    1. Test is successful when users access the ADP service app on the gallery and can access their ADP service.

1. On confirmation of a successful test, assign the federated ADP service to individual users or user groups, which is explained later in the tutorial and roll it out to your employees.

### Configure ADP to support multiple instances in the same tenant

1. Go to **Basic SAML Configuration** section and enter any instance specific URL in the **Identifier (Entity ID)** textbox. 

    > [!NOTE]
    > Please note that this can be any random value which you feel relevant for your instance.

    ![Screenshot shows how to configure another test instance value.](./media/adpfederatedsso-tutorial/append.png "Test")

1. To support multiple instances in the same tenant, please follow the below steps:

    ![Screenshot shows how to configure audience claim value.](./media/adpfederatedsso-tutorial/audience.png "Claim")

    1. Navigate to **Attributes & Claims** section > **Advanced settings** > **Advanced SAML claims options** and click **Edit**.

    1. Enable **Append application ID to issuer** checkbox.

    ![Screenshot shows how to add the application value in the federation file.](./media/adpfederatedsso-tutorial/federation.png "File")
    
1. **Save** the xml file and use in the ADP side.

### Create ADP test user

The objective of this section is to create a user called B.Simon in ADP. Work with [ADP support team](https://www.adp.com/contact-us/overview.aspx) to add the users in the ADP account. 

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the ADP for which you set up the SSO.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the ADP tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the ADP for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure ADP you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Figma

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Figma using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Figma.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Figma, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Figma SSO](#configure-figma-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Figma test user](#create-figma-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Figma that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **Figma** > **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, enter the values for the following fields:

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://www.figma.com/saml/<TENANT ID>`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://www.figma.com/saml/<TENANT ID>/consume`

1. Select **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://www.figma.com/saml/<TENANT ID>/start`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values aren't real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Sign-on URL. You get the `TENANT ID` from step#11 of Figma`s article [Configure Microsoft Entra SAML SSO process](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040532413-Configure-and-Provision-SAML-SSO-with-Azure-Active-Directory).

1. Figma application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![image](common/default-attributes.png)

1. In addition to above, Figma application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.

	| Name | Source Attribute|
	| ---------------| --------- |
	| `externalId` | `user.mailnickname` |
	| `displayName` | `user.displayname` |
	| `title` | `user.jobtitle` |
	| `emailaddress` | `user.mail` |
	| `familyName` | `user.surname` |
	| `givenName` | `givenName` |
	| `userName` | `user.userprincipalname` |

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, In the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, select copy button to copy **App Federation Metadata Url** and save it on your computer.

## Configure Figma SSO

To configure single sign-on on Figma side, you need to follow the Figma`s article [Configure Microsoft Entra SAML SSO process](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040532413-Configure-and-Provision-SAML-SSO-with-Azure-Active-Directory).

### Create Figma test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in Figma. Figma supports just-in-time provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Figma, a new one is created when you attempt to access Figma.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to Figma Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Figma Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Figma for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the Figma tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Figma for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra SSO integration with SAP Cloud for Customer

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate SAP Cloud for Customer with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate SAP Cloud for Customer with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to SAP Cloud for Customer.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to SAP Cloud for Customer with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* SAP Cloud for Customer single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* SAP Cloud for Customer supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Add SAP Cloud for Customer from the gallery

To configure the integration of SAP Cloud for Customer into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add SAP Cloud for Customer from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **SAP Cloud for Customer** in the search box.
1. Select **SAP Cloud for Customer** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for SAP Cloud for Customer

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with SAP Cloud for Customer using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in SAP Cloud for Customer.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with SAP Cloud for Customer, complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure SAP Cloud for Customer SSO](#configure-sap-cloud-for-customer-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create SAP Cloud for Customer test user](#create-sap-cloud-for-customer-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in SAP Cloud for Customer that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) integration with IntelligenceBank

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate IntelligenceBank with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate IntelligenceBank with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to IntelligenceBank.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to IntelligenceBank with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* IntelligenceBank single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* IntelligenceBank supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Add IntelligenceBank from the gallery

To configure the integration of IntelligenceBank into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add IntelligenceBank from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **IntelligenceBank** in the search box.
1. Select **IntelligenceBank** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure IntelligenceBank SSO](#configure-intelligencebank-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create IntelligenceBank test user](#create-intelligencebank-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in IntelligenceBank that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

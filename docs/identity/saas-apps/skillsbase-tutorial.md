# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra integration with Skills Base

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Skills Base with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Skills Base with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Skills Base.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Skills Base with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* A Skills Base license that supports single sign-on (SSO).

> [!NOTE]
> This integration is also available to use from Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud environment. You can find this application in the Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud Application Gallery and configure it in the same way as you do from public cloud.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* Skills Base supports **SP** initiated SSO.
* Skills Base supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

>[!NOTE]
> Skills Base does not support **IdP** initiated SSO.

## Add Skills Base from the gallery

To configure the integration of Skills Base into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Skills Base from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Skills Base** in the search box.
1. Select **Skills Base** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Skills Base

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Skills Base using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Skills Base.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Skills Base, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    2. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
2. **[Configure Skills Base SSO](#configure-skills-base-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Skills Base test user](#create-skills-base-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Skills Base that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
3. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

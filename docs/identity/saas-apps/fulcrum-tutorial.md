1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Fulcrum SSO](#configure-fulcrum-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Fulcrum test user](#create-fulcrum-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Fulcrum that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **Fulcrum** > **Single sign-on**.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following step:

    In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://web.fulcrumapp.com/saml/consume?organization=<DOMAIN>`

1. Select **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type the URL:
    `https://web.fulcrumapp.com/users/saml`

	> [!NOTE]
	> The Reply URL value isn't real. Update the value with the actual Reply URL. Contact [Fulcrum Client support team](mailto:support@fulcrumapp.com) to get the value. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section.

1. Fulcrum application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

1. In addition to above, Fulcrum application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirement.

	| Name | Source Attribute|
	| ---------------| --------------- |
	| first_name | user.givenname |
	| last_name | user.surname |
	| email | user.mail |

## Configure Fulcrum SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Fulcrum** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [Fulcrum support team](mailto:support@fulcrumapp.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Fulcrum test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in Fulcrum. Fulcrum supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Fulcrum, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to Fulcrum Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Fulcrum Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Fulcrum for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the Fulcrum tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Fulcrum for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

# Tutorial: Microsoft Entra integration with Everbridge

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Everbridge with Microsoft Entra ID.
When you integrate Everbridge with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Everbridge.
* Allow your users to be automatically signed in to Everbridge with their Microsoft Entra accounts. This access control is called single sign-on (SSO).
* Manage your accounts in one central location by using the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To configure Microsoft Entra integration with Everbridge, you need the following items:

* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a Microsoft Entra environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* An Everbridge subscription that uses single sign-on.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

* Everbridge supports IDP-initiated SSO.

## Add Everbridge from the Gallery

To configure the integration of Everbridge into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Everbridge from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Everbridge** in the search box.
1. Select **Everbridge** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Everbridge

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Everbridge using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Everbridge.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Everbridge, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create a Microsoft Entra test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Microsoft Entra test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Everbridge SSO](#configure-everbridge-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Everbridge test user](#create-everbridge-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Everbridge that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Everbridge as Everbridge member portal SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Everbridge** as an **Everbridge member portal**, send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** to the [Everbridge support team](mailto:support@everbridge.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Everbridge test user

In this section, you create the test user Britta Simon in Everbridge. To add users in the Everbridge platform, work with the [Everbridge support team](mailto:support@everbridge.com). Users must be created and activated in Everbridge before you use single sign-on. 

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Everbridge for which you set up the SSO.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Everbridge tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the Everbridge for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure Everbridge you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Crowd Log SSO](#configure-crowd-log-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.

## Configure Crowd Log SSO

To perform the Single Sign-On configuration on the Crowd Log side, please follow [this](https://support.crowdlog.jp/portal/ja/kb/articles/admin-settings-saml) link.

### Create Crowd Log test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Crowd Log. For more information on how to create a user, please refer [this](https://support.crowdlog.jp/portal/ja/kb/articles/admin-memberadmin-member-create) link.  

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, this option redirects to Crowd Log Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Crowd Log Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Crowd Log for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you select the Crowd Log tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Crowd Log for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

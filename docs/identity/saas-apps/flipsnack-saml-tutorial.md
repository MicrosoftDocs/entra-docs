# Microsoft Entra SSO integration with Flipsnack SAML

In this article, you'll learn how to integrate Flipsnack SAML with Microsoft Entra ID. Flipsnack is the complete solution perfect for creating interactive catalogs, magazines, brochures & many more. Convert a PDF file to a flipbook or make the entire design from scratch. When you integrate Flipsnack SAML with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Flipsnack SAML.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Flipsnack SAML with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

You'll configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on for Flipsnack SAML in a test environment. Flipsnack SAML supports both **SP** and **IDP** initiated single sign-on and **Just In Time** user provisioning.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Microsoft Entra ID with Flipsnack SAML, you need:

* A Microsoft Entra user account. If you don't already have one, you can [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* One of the following roles: [Application Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#application-administrator), [Cloud Application Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#cloud-application-administrator), or [Application Owner](/entra/fundamentals/users-default-permissions#owned-enterprise-applications).
* A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Flipsnack SAML single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Add application and assign a test user

Before you begin the process of configuring single sign-on, you need to add the Flipsnack SAML application from the Microsoft Entra gallery. You need a test user account to assign to the application and test the single sign-on configuration.

### Add Flipsnack SAML from the Microsoft Entra gallery

Add Flipsnack SAML from the Microsoft Entra application gallery to configure single sign-on with Flipsnack SAML. For more information on how to add application from the gallery, see the [Quickstart: Add application from the gallery](~/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal.md).

### Create and assign Microsoft Entra test user

Follow the guidelines in the [create and assign a user account](~/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal-assign-users.md) article to create a test user account called B.Simon.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, and assign roles. The wizard also provides a link to the single sign-on configuration pane.

### Create Flipsnack SAML test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in Flipsnack SAML. Flipsnack SAML supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Flipsnack SAML, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, this will redirect to Flipsnack SAML Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Flipsnack SAML Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Flipsnack SAML for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the Flipsnack SAML tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign-on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Flipsnack SAML for which you set up the SSO. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra My Apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/end-user-experiences#azure-ad-my-apps).

## Next steps

Once you configure Flipsnack SAML you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).

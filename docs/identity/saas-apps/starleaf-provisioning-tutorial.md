# Customer intent: As an IT administrator, I want to learn how to automatically provision and deprovision user accounts from Microsoft Entra ID to StarLeaf so that I can streamline the user management process and ensure that users have the appropriate access to StarLeaf.

# Tutorial: Configure StarLeaf for automatic user provisioning

The objective of this tutorial is to demonstrate the steps to be performed in StarLeaf and Microsoft Entra ID to configure Microsoft Entra ID to automatically provision and de-provision users and/or groups to StarLeaf.

> [!NOTE]
>  This tutorial describes a connector built on top of the Microsoft Entra user provisioning service. For important details on what this service does, how it works, and frequently asked questions, see [Automate user provisioning and deprovisioning to SaaS applications with Microsoft Entra ID](~/identity/app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md).
>
> This connector is currently in Preview. For more information about previews, see [Universal License Terms For Online Services](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/product/ForOnlineServices/all).

## Prerequisites

The scenario outlined in this tutorial assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

* A Microsoft Entra tenant.
* [A StarLeaf tenant](https://starleaf.com/).
* A user account in StarLeaf with Admin permissions.

## Assign users to StarLeaf
Microsoft Entra ID uses a concept called assignments to determine which users should receive access to selected apps. In the context of automatic user provisioning, only the users and/or groups that have been assigned to an application in Microsoft Entra ID are synchronized.

Before you configure and enable automatic user provisioning, you should decide which users and groups in Microsoft Entra ID need access to StarLeaf. Then you can assign the users and groups to StarLeaf by following [these instructions](~/identity/enterprise-apps/assign-user-or-group-access-portal.md).

## Important tips for assigning users to StarLeaf

* It's recommended that a single Microsoft Entra user is assigned to StarLeaf to test the automatic user provisioning configuration. Additional users and groups can be assigned later.

* When you assign a user to StarLeaf, you must select any valid application-specific role (if available) in the assignment dialog. Users with the Default Access role are excluded from provisioning.

## Set up StarLeaf for provisioning

Before you configure StarLeaf for automatic user provisioning with Microsoft Entra ID, you will need to configure SCIM provisioning in StarLeaf:

1. Sign in to your StarLeaf Admin Console. Navigate to **Integrations** > **Add integration**.

2. Select the **Type** to be Microsoft Entra ID. Enter a suitable name in **Name**. Click **Apply**.

	![Screenshot of the Add integration dialog box with the Type and Name text boxes called out.](media/starleaf-provisioning-tutorial/image01.png)

3.  The **SCIM base URL** and **Access token** values will be then displayed. These values will be entered in the **Tenant URL** and **Secret Token** fields in the Provisioning tab of your StarLeaf application.

## Add StarLeaf from the gallery

To configuring StarLeaf for automatic user provisioning with Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add StarLeaf from the Microsoft Entra application gallery to your list of managed SaaS applications.

**To add StarLeaf from the Microsoft Entra application gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **StarLeaf**, select **StarLeaf** in the results panel.

## Configure automatic user provisioning to StarLeaf

This section guides you through the steps to configure the Microsoft Entra provisioning service to create, update, and disable users and/or groups in StarLeaf based on user and/or group assignments in Microsoft Entra ID.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications**

	![Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

1. In the applications list, select **StarLeaf**.

	![The StarLeaf link in the Applications list](common/all-applications.png)

3. Select the **Provisioning** tab.

	![Screenshot of the Manage options with the Provisioning option called out.](common/provisioning.png)

4. Set the **Provisioning Mode** to **Automatic**.

	![Screenshot of the Provisioning Mode dropdown list with the Automatic option called out.](common/provisioning-automatic.png)

5. Under the Admin Credentials section, input the **SCIM Base URL** and **Access Token** values retrieved earlier in **Tenant URL** and **Secret Token** respectively. Click **Test Connection** to ensure Microsoft Entra ID can connect to StarLeaf. If the connection fails, ensure your StarLeaf account has Admin permissions and try again.

	![Tenant URL + Token](common/provisioning-testconnection-tenanturltoken.png)

6. In the **Notification Email** field, enter the email address of a person or group who should receive the provisioning error notifications and check the **Send an email notification when a failure occurs** box.

	![Notification Email](common/provisioning-notification-email.png)

7. Click **Save**.

8. Under the **Mappings** section, select **Synchronize Microsoft Entra users to StarLeaf**.

	![Screenshot of the Mappings section showing the Synchronize Microsoft Entra users to StarLeaf option.](media/starleaf-provisioning-tutorial/usermapping.png)

9. Review the user attributes that are synchronized from Microsoft Entra ID to StarLeaf in the **Attribute Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the user accounts in StarLeaf for update operations. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.

	![Screenshot of the Attribute Mappings section showing nine mappings displayed.](media/starleaf-provisioning-tutorial/userattribute.png)


10. To configure scoping filters, refer to the following instructions provided in the [Scoping filter tutorial](~/identity/app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).


11. To enable the Microsoft Entra provisioning service for StarLeaf, change the **Provisioning Status** to **On** in the **Settings** section.

	![Provisioning Status Toggled On](common/provisioning-toggle-on.png)

12. Define the users and/or groups that you would like to provision to StarLeaf by choosing the desired values in **Scope** in the **Settings** section.

	![Provisioning Scope](common/provisioning-scope.png)

13. When you are ready to provision, click **Save**.

	![Saving Provisioning Configuration](common/provisioning-configuration-save.png)

This operation starts the initial synchronization of all users and/or groups defined in **Scope** in the **Settings** section. The initial sync takes longer to perform than subsequent syncs, which occur approximately every 40 minutes as long as the Microsoft Entra provisioning service is running. You can use the **Synchronization Details** section to monitor progress and follow links to provisioning activity report, which describes all actions performed by the Microsoft Entra provisioning service on StarLeaf.

## Connector limitations

* StarLeaf doesn't currently support group provisioning. 
* StarLeaf requires **email** and **userName** values to have the same source value.

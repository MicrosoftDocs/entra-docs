# Configure Netop Portal for Single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID

In this article,  you learn how to integrate Netop Portal with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate Netop Portal with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

* Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to Netop Portal.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Netop Portal with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites
The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

[!INCLUDE [common-prerequisites.md](~/identity/saas-apps/includes/common-prerequisites.md)]
* Netop Portal single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> This integration is also available to use from Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud environment. You can find this application in the Microsoft Entra US Government Cloud Application Gallery and configure it in the same way as you do from public cloud.

## Scenario description

In this article,  you configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO in a test environment.

* Netop Portal supports **IDP** initiated SSO.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add Netop Portal from the gallery

To configure the integration of Netop Portal into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Netop Portal from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#cloud-application-administrator).
1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Netop Portal** in the search box.
1. Select **Netop Portal** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Netop Portal SSO](#configure-netop-portal-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, the application is pre-configured in **IDP** initiated mode and the necessary URLs are already pre-populated with Azure. The user needs to save the configuration by selecting the **Save** button.

1. In addition to above, Netop Portal application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response, which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirement.

	| Name |  Source Attribute|
	| ---------------| --------- |
	| NRC-ACCOUNT-ID | "adfs-demo" |
	| NRC-EMAIL | user.userprincipalname |
	| NRC-GIVEN-NAME | user.givenname |
	| NRC-SURNAME | user.surname |
	| NRC-USERNAME | user.userprincipalname |
	| nameidentifier | user.userprincipalname |
	| | |

1. On the **Set-up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

### Create Netop Portal test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Netop Portal. Work with [Netop Portal support team](mailto:casemanager@netop.com) to add the users in the Netop Portal platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the Netop Portal for which you set up the SSO.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the Netop Portal tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the Netop Portal for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

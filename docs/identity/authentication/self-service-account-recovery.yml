     - question: |
          Account Reovery looks great, should I enalbe it for ALL Users in my company now?  
 
        answer: |
          No, this is still a Public Preview of the functionality, and primialrly it's to help tenants understand and expeirnece the self-serv user verification flow. We recomend in the preview period picking a few test users to try out the verificaiton experinece. As you build trust the system is working correctly for you, then its a good moment to allow some users to use Account Recovery and not require them to only use your standard manual helpdesk flow. THere are also some accounts you might only ever want to allow remote recovery with an in-person or human in the loop process for safety, can imagine CEO or finance controller would not be appropiate for self-serv recovery due to the nature of the account.
    
      - question: |
          Do I cost this as needing an ID Verification for every single user in my tenant?  
 
        answer: |
          No, it's usually just less than 3% of a tenant users each month that would typically lose total access to their account, and thus incurr the cost of the verficiation from the Indentity Verification Provider.

      - question: |
          Where does the user data go during the verification?
        answer: |
          IDVs have privacy and data retention details as part of the verification offer from Security Store.

      - question: |
          Can I bring my own IDV to this process and not use the secure exchange providers?
        answer: |
          Not for now in Public Preview, you can contact us about the provider you are currently using for user verification.

       - question: |
          What elements are compared in verified ID for the user to account info for the user requesting the account recovery?  
 
        answer: |
          For Public Preview we verify the photo in the ID matches the requesting user with Face Check, and also look at the First Name and Surname for the user account. If those elements are not an exact match then Account Recoery will not complete for the user, and they will have to follow their normal helpdesk process to regain access to their account.

        - question: |
          What happens with two people with same name try to recover an account, such as two John Smiths in the company?
 
        answer: |
          In future releases we'll offer the ability for Admins to "sync" more HR data in the MS Graph in secure locations to allow for Account Reovery to disambiguate between users with similar names, for smaller intial testing of the feature during Public Preview this should not be a major problme for smaller groups of users.

sections:
- name: How Recovery Works
  questions:
    - question: |
        Where does the user data go during the identity verification process?
      answer: |
        > IDV providers have privacy and data retention details as part of the verification offer from Security Store.
        > Please see the specific provider information for more details.
    - question: |
        How is the Verified ID issued from a provider matched against Entra ID account details?
      answer: |
        > For Public Preview we first verify proof of presence through comparison of the photo in the ID compared to real-time Face Check.
        > Next, we match the First Name and Surname for the user account against the verified government ID.
        > If those elements are not an exact match, then Account Recovery will not complete for the user, and they will have to follow their normal helpdesk process to regain access to their account.
    - question: |
        What happens when two people with the same name try to recover an account, such as two John Smiths in the company?
      answer: |
        > In future releases we'll offer the ability for Admins to sync more HR data to Entra ID through custom security attributes, enabling account recovery to disambiguate between users with similar names.
        > During public preview we recommend initial testing of the feature with a smaller group of users where this should not be an issue.

- name: Account Recovery Setup
  questions:
    - question: |
        Account recovery looks great, should I enable it for ALL Users in my company now?
      answer: |
        > No, this feature is still in Public Preview. Its primary purpose is to help tenants understand and experience the self-service user verification flow.
        > During the preview period, we recommend selecting a few test users to try out the verification experience.
        > As you gain confidence that the system is working correctly for your organization, you can begin allowing some users to use Account Recovery, rather than requiring everyone to go through your standard manual helpdesk process.
        > For certain accounts—such as those belonging to a CEO or finance controller—you may want to restrict recovery to remote or in-person processes that include a human in the loop, for added security at this time. These accounts may not be appropriate for self-service recovery due to their sensitive nature.
    - question: |
        How do I estimate the cost of Entra ID Account Recovery across my organization?
      answer: |
        > Account recovery requests typically affect about 1–3% of your user base each month.
        > To estimate costs and potential savings, use the cost savings calculator in the Account Recovery blade in Entra.
        > Enter your current helpdesk costs, target user count, and the cost per verification from your chosen provider.
        > The calculator will help you compare your current spend with projected self-service recovery costs, making it easy to model savings for your scenario.
    - question: |
        What license is required to use Entra ID Account Recovery?
      answer: |
        > At this time users need to be licensed for at least Entra ID P1 to utilize the account recovery service.


- name: Identity Verification Provider selection and usage
  questions:
    - question: |
        Can I bring my own Identity verification provider and contract to Entra ID account recovery?
      answer: |
        > Not for now. Public preview only supports providers through Microsoft Security Store.

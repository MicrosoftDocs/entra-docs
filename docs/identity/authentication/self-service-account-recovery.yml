- name: How account recovery works
  questions:
    - question: |
        What license is required to use Microsoft Entra ID account recovery?
      answer: |
        > Users need a [Microsoft Entra ID P1 license](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/microsoft-entra-pricing) to use the account recovery service. [Face Check license](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/microsoft-entra-verified-id) is also required, either Entra Suite or Standalone. Cost for the IDV provider is for the offer that you subscribe to in the flow.
    - question: |
        Where does the user data go during the identity verification process?
      answer: |
        > IDV providers have privacy and data retention details as part of the verification offer from Security Store.
        > For more information, see your provider documentation.
    - question: |
        How is the Verified ID issued from a provider matched against Microsoft Entra ID account details?
      answer: |
        > For preview, we first verify proof of presence by comparing the photo in the ID compared to real-time [Face Check](/entra/verified-id/using-facecheck).
        > Next, we match the **First name** and **Last name** for the user account against the verified government ID.
        > If those elements aren't an exact match, then account recovery doesn't complete for the user, and they need to follow their normal helpdesk process to regain access to their account.
    - question: |
        What happens when people with the same name try to recover an account?
      answer: |
        > During preview, recovery attempts from users with the same name as another user will be blocked from recovery. We recommend initial testing of the feature with a smaller group of users where this shouldn't be an issue.
        > We're working to provide the ability for admins to sync more Human Resources (HR) data to Microsoft Entra ID by using custom security attributes to disambiguate between users with similar names and enable account recovery for them.

- name: Account recovery setup
  questions:
    - question: |
        Account recovery looks great! Should I enable it for all users in my company now?
      answer: |
        > No, this feature is still in preview. Its primary purpose is to help tenants understand and experience the self-service user verification flow.
        > During the preview, select a few test users to try out the verification experience.
        > As you gain confidence that the system is working correctly for your organization, you can begin to allow more users to use account recovery, rather than requiring everyone to go through your standard manual helpdesk process.
        > For certain accounts—such as those belonging to a CEO or finance controller—you might restrict recovery to remote or in-person processes that include a human in the loop, for added security. These accounts might not be appropriate for self-service recovery due to their sensitive nature.
    - question: |
        How do I estimate the cost of Microsoft Entra ID account recovery across my organization?
      answer: |
        > Account recovery requests typically affect about 1% to 3% of users each month.
        > To estimate costs and potential savings, use the cost savings calculator in account recovery in the Microsoft Entra admin center.
        > Enter your current helpdesk costs, target user count, and the cost per verification from your chosen provider.
        > The calculator compares your current spending with projected self-service recovery costs, so you can easily model savings for your scenario.

- name: Identity Verification Provider selection and usage
  questions:
    - question: |
        Can I bring my own Identity verification provider and contract to Microsoft Entra ID account recovery?
      answer: |
        > Microsoft Entra ID account recovery only supports reviewed and approved providers through Microsoft Security Store.

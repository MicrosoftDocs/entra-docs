# Troubleshooting combined security information registration

## Troubleshooting interrupt mode

| Symptom | Troubleshooting steps |
| --- | --- |
| I'm not seeing the methods I expected to see. | 1. Check if the user has a Microsoft Entra admin role. If yes, view the SSPR admin policy differences. <br> 2. Determine whether the user is being interrupted because of multifactor authentication (MFA) registration enforcement or SSPR registration enforcement. See the [flowchart](~/identity/authentication/concept-registration-mfa-sspr-combined.md#combined-registration-modes) under "Combined registration modes" to determine which methods should be shown. <br> 3. Determine how recently the MFA or SSPR policy was changed. If the change was recent, it might take some time for the updated policy to propagate.|

## Troubleshooting manage mode

| Symptom | Troubleshooting steps |
| --- | --- |
| I don't have the option to add a particular method. | 1. Determine whether the method is enabled for MFA or for SSPR. <br> 2. If the method is enabled, save the policies again and wait 1-2 hours before testing again. <br> 3. If the method is enabled, ensure that the user hasn't already set up the maximum number of that method that they're allowed to set up.|


## How to require user to re-register for multifactor authentication

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least an [Authentication Policy Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#authentication-policy-administrator).
1. Browse to **Users**, and select the user whom you want to re-register MFA. 
1. Click **Authentication methods**, and click **Require re-register for multifactor authentication**.
1. Click **OK** to confirm.

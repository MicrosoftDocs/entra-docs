# App support for SMS-based authentication

SMS-based authentication is available to Microsoft apps integrated with the Microsoft identity platform (Microsoft Entra ID). The table lists some of the web and mobile apps that support SMS-based authentication. If you would like to add or validate any app, [contact us](https://feedback.azure.com/d365community/forum/22920db1-ad25-ec11-b6e6-000d3a4f0789). 

| App | Web/browser app | Native mobile app |
| --- |:---:|:---:|
| Office 365- Microsoft Online Services* | ● |   |
| Microsoft One Note | ● |   |
| Microsoft Teams | ● | ● |
| Company portal | ● | ● |
| My Apps portal | ● |Not available|
| Microsoft Forms | ● |Not available|
| Microsoft Edge | ● |   |
| Microsoft Power BI | ● |   |

*_SMS sign-in isn't available for office applications, such as Word, Excel, etc., when accessed directly on the web, but is available when accessed through the [Office 365 web app](https://www.office.com)_

The above mentioned Microsoft apps support SMS sign-in is because they use the Microsoft Identity login (`https://login.microsoftonline.com/`), which allows users to enter phone number and SMS code.

## Unsupported Microsoft apps

Microsoft 365 desktop (Windows or Mac) apps and Microsoft 365 web apps (except MS One Note) that are accessed directly on the web don't support SMS sign-in. These apps use the Microsoft Office login (`https://office.live.com/start/*`) that requires a password to sign in.
For the same reason, Microsoft Office mobile apps (except Microsoft Teams, Company portal, and Microsoft Azure) don't support SMS sign-in.

| Unsupported Microsoft apps| Examples |
| --- | --- |
| Native desktop Microsoft apps | Microsoft Teams, O365 apps, Word, Excel, and so on.|
| Native mobile Microsoft apps (except Microsoft Teams, Company portal, and Microsoft Azure) | Outlook, Edge, Power BI, Stream, SharePoint, Power Apps, Word, and so on.|
| Microsoft 365 web apps (accessed directly on web) | [Outlook](https://outlook.live.com/owa/), [Word](https://office.live.com/start/Word.aspx), [Excel](https://office.live.com/start/Excel.aspx), [PowerPoint](https://office.live.com/start/PowerPoint.aspx)|  

## Support for Non-Microsoft apps 

To make Non-Micorosoft apps compatible with the SMS sign-in feature: 
- Integrate Non-Microsoft web apps with Microsoft Entra ID and use Microsoft Entra authentication. Use Security Assertion Markup Language [SAML](~/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal-setup-sso.md) or OpenID Connect [OIDC](~/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal-setup-oidc-sso.md) to integrate with Microsoft Entra SSO. 
- Integrate Non-Microsoft on-prem apps with Microsoft Entra ID using [Microsoft Entra application proxy](~/identity/app-proxy/application-proxy-add-on-premises-application.md)
- Integrate Non-Microsoft client apps with [Microsoft identity platform](~/identity-platform/v2-overview.md) for authentication 
    - [Sample app iOS](~/identity-platform/tutorial-v2-ios.md)
    - [Sample app Android](~/identity-platform/tutorial-v2-android.md)

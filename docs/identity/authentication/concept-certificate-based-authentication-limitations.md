# Limitations with Microsoft Entra certificate-based authentication 

This article covers supported and unsupported scenarios for Microsoft Entra certificate-based authentication.

## Supported scenarios

The following scenarios are supported:

- User sign-ins to web browser-based applications on all platforms.
- User sign-ins to Office mobile apps, including Outlook, OneDrive, and so on.
- User sign-ins on mobile native browsers.
- Support for granular authentication rules for multifactor authentication by using the certificate issuer **Subject** and **policy OIDs**.
- Configuring certificate-to-user account bindings by using any of the certificate fields:
  - Subject Alternate Name (SAN) PrincipalName and SAN RFC822Name
  - Subject Key Identifier (SKI) and SHA1PublicKey
- Configuring certificate-to-user account bindings by using any of the user object attributes:
  - User Principal Name
  - onPremisesUserPrincipalName
  - CertificateUserIds

## Unsupported scenarios

The following scenarios aren't supported:

- Public Key Infrastructure for creating client certificates. Customers need to configure their own Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and provision certificates to their users and devices. 
- Certificate Authority hints aren't supported, so the list of certificates that appears for users in the UI isn't scoped.
- Only one CRL Distribution Point (CDP) for a trusted CA is supported.
- The CDP can be only HTTP URLs. We don't support Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP), or Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) URLs.
- Configuring other certificate-to-user account bindings, such as using the **subject + issuer** or **Issuer + Serial Number**, arenâ€™t available in this release.
- Currently, password can't be disabled when CBA is enabled and the option to sign in using a password is displayed.

>[!NOTE]
> On iOS and Android mobile, Microsoft Edge browser users can sign into Microsoft Edge to set up a profile by using the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL), like the Add account flow. When logged in to Microsoft Edge with a profile, CBA is supported with on-device certificates and smart cards.

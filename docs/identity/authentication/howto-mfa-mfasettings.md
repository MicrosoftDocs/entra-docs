# Configure Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication settings

To customize the end-user experience for Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication (MFA), you can configure options for settings like account lockout thresholds or fraud alerts and notifications. 

>[!NOTE]
>[Report suspicious activity](#report-suspicious-activity) replaces the Block/unblock users, Fraud alert, and Notifications legacy features. On March 1, 2025, the legacy features will be removed. 
 
The following table describes Microsoft Entra MFA settings, and subsections cover each setting in more detail.

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| [Account lockout (MFA Server only)](#account-lockout-mfa-server-only) | Temporarily lock accounts from using Microsoft Entra MFA if there are too many denied authentication attempts in a row. This feature applies only to users who use MFA Server to enter a PIN to authenticate. |
| [Report suspicious activity](#report-suspicious-activity) | Configure settings that allow users to report fraudulent verification requests. Report suspicious activity replaces these features: Block/unblock users, Fraud alert, and Notifications.|
| [Fraud alert](#fraud-alert) | This feature will be removed on March 1, 2025. Use [Report suspicious activity](#report-suspicious-activity) to allow users to report fraudulent verification requests.  |
| [Block/unblock users](#block-and-unblock-users) | This feature will be removed on March 1, 2025. Use [Report suspicious activity](#report-suspicious-activity) to allow users to report fraudulent verification requests. These alerts are integrated with [Identity Protection](~/id-protection/overview-identity-protection.md). You can use [risk based policies](~/id-protection/concept-identity-protection-policies.md#user-risk-based-conditional-access-policy) or create your own workflows by using [risk detection events](/graph/api/resources/riskdetection) to temporarily limit user access and remediate risk. |
| [Notifications](#notifications) | This feature will be removed on March 1, 2025. Use [Report suspicious activity](#report-suspicious-activity) to allow users to report fraudulent verification requests. You can use [risk notifications](~/id-protection/howto-identity-protection-configure-notifications.md) or create your own workflows by using [risk detection events](/graph/api/resources/riskdetection) to enable email notifications for user reported fraud events.  |
| [OATH tokens](concept-authentication-oath-tokens.md) | Used in cloud-based Microsoft Entra MFA environments to manage OATH tokens for users. |
| [Phone call settings](#phone-call-settings) | Configure settings related to phone calls and greetings for cloud and on-premises environments. |
| Providers | This will show any existing authentication providers that you've associated with your account. Adding new providers is disabled as of September 1, 2018. |

## Account lockout (MFA Server only)


>[!NOTE]
>Account lockout only affects users who sign in by using MFA Server on-premises. 

To prevent repeated MFA attempts as part of an attack, the account lockout settings let you specify how many failed attempts to allow before the account becomes locked out for a period of time. The account lockout settings are applied only when a PIN code is entered for the MFA prompt by using MFA Server on-premises.

The following settings are available:

* Number of MFA denials that trigger account lockout
* Minutes until account lockout counter is reset
* Minutes until account is automatically unblocked

To configure account lockout settings, complete these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least an [Authentication Policy Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#authentication-policy-administrator).
1. Browse to **Protection** > **Multifactor authentication** > **Account lockout**. You might need to click **Show more** to see **Multifactor authentication**.
1. Enter the values for your environment, and then select **Save**.

    ![Screenshot that shows the account lockout settings.](./media/howto-mfa-mfasettings/account-lockout-settings.png)

## Report suspicious activity

**Report suspicious activity** replaces these legacy features: Block/unblock users, Fraud alert, and Notifications. 

When an unknown and suspicious MFA prompt is received, users can report the fraud attempt by using Microsoft Authenticator or through their phone. These alerts are integrated with [Identity Protection](~/id-protection/overview-identity-protection.md) for more comprehensive coverage and capability. 

Users who report an MFA prompt as suspicious are set to **High User Risk**. Administrators can use risk-based policies to limit access for these users, or enable self-service password reset (SSPR) for users to remediate problems on their own. 

If you previously used the Fraud Alert automatic blocking feature and don't have a Microsoft Entra ID P2 license for risk-based policies, you can use risk detection events to either manually identify and disable impacted users, or set up automation by using custom workflows with Microsoft Graph. For more information about investigating and remediating user risk, see:

- [How to: Investigate risk](~/id-protection/howto-identity-protection-investigate-risk.md)
- [How to: Remediate risks and unblock users](~/id-protection/howto-identity-protection-remediate-unblock.md)

To enable **Report suspicious activity** from the Authentication methods policy **Settings**:   

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least an [Authentication Policy Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#authentication-policy-administrator).
1. Browse to **Protection** > **Authentication methods** > **Settings**. 
1. Set **Report suspicious activity** to **Enabled**. The feature remains disabled if you choose **Microsoft managed**. For more information about Microsoft managed values, see [Protecting authentication methods in Microsoft Entra ID](concept-authentication-default-enablement.md).
   :::image type="content" border="true" source="media/howto-mfa-mfasettings/report-suspicious-activity.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to enable Report suspicious activity.":::
1. Select **All users** or a specific group. 
1. If you also upload custom greetings for your tenant, select a **Reporting code**. The reporting code is the number that users enter into their phone to report suspicious activity. The reporting code is only applicable if custom greetings are also uploaded by an [Authentication Policy Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#authentication-policy-administrator). Otherwise, the default code is 0, regardless of any value specified in the policy.
1. Click **Save**. 

>[!NOTE]
>If you enable **Report suspicious activity** and specify a custom voice reporting value while the tenant still has **Fraud Alert** enabled in parallel with a custom voice reporting number configured, the **Report suspicious activity** value will be used instead of **Fraud Alert**.

### Remediating risk for tenants with Microsoft Entra ID P1 license

When a user reports an MFA prompt as suspicious, the event shows up in the Sign-ins report (as a sign-in that was rejected by the user), in the Audit logs, and in the Risk detections report.   

| Report | Admin center | Details |
|--------------|--------|---------|
| Risk detections report | **Protection** > **Identity Protection** > **Risk detection** | Detection type: **User Reported Suspicious Activity**<br>Risk level: **High**<br>Source **End user reported** |
| Sign-ins report | **Identity** > **Monitoring & health** > **Sign-in logs** > **Authentication details** | Result detail will show as **MFA denied, fraud code entered** |
| Audit logs   | **Identity** > **Monitoring & health** > **Audit logs** | The fraud report will appear under Activity type **Fraud reported** |

>[!NOTE]
>A user isn't reported as High Risk if they perform passwordless authentication.

You can also query for risk detections and users flagged as risky by using Microsoft Graph.

| API | Detail |
|-----|--------|
| [riskDetection resource type](/graph/api/resources/riskdetection) | riskEventType: `userReportedSuspiciousActivity` |
| [List riskyUsers](/graph/api/riskyuser-list) | riskLevel = **high** |

For manual remediation, administrators or helpdesk can ask the users to reset their password by using self-service password reset (SSPR), or do so on their behalf. For automated remediation, use the Microsoft Graph APIs, or use PowerShell to create a script that changes the userâ€™s password,  forces SSPR, revokes sign-in sessions, or temporarily disables the user account.

### Remediating risk for tenants with Microsoft Entra ID P2 license

Tenants with a Microsoft Entra ID P2 license can use risk-based Conditional Access policies to automatically remediate user risk, in addition to the options Microsoft Entra ID P2 license.

Configure a policy that looks at user risk under **Conditions** > **User risk**. Look for users where risk = high to either block them from sign in or require them to reset their password.

:::image type="content" border="true" source="media/howto-mfa-mfasettings/risk-based-conditional-access.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to enable a risk-based Conditional Access policy.":::

For more information, see [Sign-in risk-based Conditional Access policy](~/id-protection/concept-identity-protection-policies.md#sign-in-risk-based-conditional-access-policy).

### Report suspicious activity and fraud alert 

**Report suspicious activity** and the legacy **Fraud Alert** implementation can operate in parallel. You can keep your tenant-wide **Fraud Alert** functionality in place while you start to use **Report suspicious activity** with a targeted test group. 

If **Fraud Alert** is enabled with Automatic Blocking, and **Report suspicious activity** is enabled, the user will be added to the blocklist and set as high-risk and in-scope for any other policies configured. These users will need to be removed from the blocklist and have their risk remediated to enable them to sign in with MFA. 

## Fraud alert

[Report suspicious activity](#report-suspicious-activity) replaces Fraud alert due to its integration with Identity Protection for risk-driven remediation, better reporting capabilities, and least-privileged administration. The Fraud alert feature will be removed on March 1, 2025. 

The Fraud alert feature lets users report fraudulent attempts to access their resources. When an unknown and suspicious MFA prompt is received, users can report the fraud attempt by using the Microsoft Authenticator app or through their phone. The following fraud alert configuration options are available:

* **Automatically block users who report fraud**. If a user reports fraud, the Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication attempts for the user  account are blocked for 90 days or until an administrator unblocks the account. An administrator can review sign-ins by using the sign-in report, and take appropriate action to prevent future fraud. An administrator can then [unblock](#unblock-a-user) the user's account.
* **Code to report fraud during initial greeting**. When users receive a phone call to perform multifactor authentication, they normally press **#** to confirm their sign-in. To report fraud, the user enters a code before pressing **#**. This code is **0** by default, but you can customize it. If automatic blocking is enabled, after the user presses **0#** to report fraud, they need to press **1** to confirm the account blocking.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The default voice greetings from Microsoft instruct users to press **0#** to submit a fraud alert. If you want to use a code other than **0**, record and upload your own custom voice greetings with appropriate instructions for your users.

To enable and configure fraud alerts, complete the following steps:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least an [Authentication Policy Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#authentication-policy-administrator).
1. Browse to **Protection** > **Multifactor authentication** > **Fraud alert**.
1. Set **Allow users to submit fraud alerts** to **On**.
1. Configure the **Automatically block users who report fraud** or **Code to report fraud during initial greeting** setting as needed.
1. Select **Save**.


## Block and unblock users

[Report suspicious activity](#report-suspicious-activity) replaces Fraud alert due to its integration with Identity Protection for risk-driven remediation, better reporting capabilities, and least-privileged administration. The Block/unblock users feature will be removed on March 1, 2025.

If a user's device is lost or stolen, you can block Microsoft Entra MFA attempts for the associated account. Any Microsoft Entra MFA attempts for blocked users are automatically denied. The user isn't challenged with MFA for 90 days from the time they're blocked.

### Block a user

To block a user, complete the following steps. 

1. Browse to **Protection** > **Multifactor authentication** > **Block/unblock users**.
1. Select **Add** to block a user.
1. Enter the user name for the blocked user in the format `username@domain.com`, and then provide a comment in the **Reason** box.
1. Select **OK** to block the user.

### Unblock a user

To unblock a user, complete the following steps:

1. Go to **Protection** > **Multifactor authentication** > **Block/unblock users**.
1. In the **Action** column next to the user, select **Unblock**.
1. Enter a comment in the **Reason for unblocking** box.
1. Select **OK** to unblock the user.

## Notifications

[Report suspicious activity](#report-suspicious-activity) replaces Notifications due to its integration with Identity Protection for risk-driven remediation, better reporting capabilities, and least-privileged administration. The Notifications feature will be removed on March 1, 2025. 

You can configure Microsoft Entra ID to send email notifications when users report fraud alerts. These notifications are typically sent to identity administrators, because the user's account credentials are likely compromised. The following example shows what a fraud alert notification email looks like:

![Screenshot that shows a fraud alert notification email.](./media/howto-mfa-mfasettings/multi-factor-authentication-fraud-alert-email.png)

To configure fraud alert notifications:

1. Go to **Protection** > **Multifactor authentication** > **Notifications**.
1. Enter the email address to send the notification to.
1. To remove an existing email address, select **...** next to the email address, and then select **Delete**.
1. Select **Save**.

## OATH tokens

Microsoft Entra ID supports the use of OATH TOTP SHA-1 tokens that refresh codes every 30 or 60 seconds. You can purchase these tokens from the vendor of your choice.

OATH TOTP hardware tokens typically come with a secret key, or seed, pre-programmed in the token. You need to input these keys into Microsoft Entra ID as described in the following steps. Secret keys are limited to 128 characters, which might not be compatible with all tokens. The secret key can contain only the characters *a-z* or *A-Z* and digits *1-7*. It must be encoded in Base32.

Programmable OATH TOTP hardware tokens that can be reseeded can also be set up with Microsoft Entra ID in the software token setup flow.

OATH hardware tokens are supported as part of a public preview. For more information about previews, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://aka.ms/EntraPreviewsTermsOfUse).

![Screenshot that shows the OATH tokens section.](media/concept-authentication-methods/oath-tokens.png)

After you acquire tokens, you need to upload them in a comma-separated values (CSV) file format. Include the UPN, serial number, secret key, time interval, manufacturer, and model, as shown in this example:

```csv
upn,serial number,secret key,time interval,manufacturer,model
Helga@contoso.com,1234567,1234567abcdef1234567abcdef,60,Contoso,HardwareKey
```

> [!NOTE]
> Be sure to include the header row in your CSV file.

Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as a Global Administrator, go to **Protection** > **Multifactor authentication** > **OATH tokens**, and upload the CSV file.

Depending on the size of the CSV file, it might take a few minutes to process. Select **Refresh** to get the status. If there are any errors in the file, you can download a CSV file that lists them. The field names in the downloaded CSV file are different from those in the uploaded version.

After any errors are addressed, the administrator can activate each key by selecting **Activate** for the token and entering the OTP displayed in the token.

Users can have a combination of up to five OATH hardware tokens or authenticator applications, such as the Microsoft Authenticator app, configured for use at any time. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Make sure to only assign each token to a single user.
>In the future, support for the assignment of a single token to multiple users will stop to prevent a security risk.

## Phone call settings

If users receive phone calls for MFA prompts, you can configure their experience, such as caller ID or the voice greeting they hear.

In the United States, if you haven't configured MFA caller ID, voice calls from Microsoft come from the following numbers. Users with spam filters should exclude these numbers.

Default number: *+1 (855) 330-8653*

The following table lists more numbers for different countries.

> [!NOTE]
> When Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication calls are placed through the public telephone network, sometimes the calls are routed through a carrier that doesn't support caller ID. Because of this, caller ID isn't guaranteed, even though Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication always sends it. This applies both to phone calls and text messages provided by Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication. If you need to validate that a text message is from Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication, see [What short codes are used for sending messages?](multi-factor-authentication-faq.yml#what-short-codes-are-used-for-sending-text-messages-to-my-users-).

To configure your own caller ID number, complete the following steps:

1. Go to **Protection** > **Multifactor authentication** > **Phone call settings**.
1. Set the **MFA caller ID number** to the number you want users to see on their phones. Only US-based numbers are allowed.
1. Select **Save**.

### Custom voice messages

You can use your own recordings or greetings for Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication. These messages can be used in addition to the default Microsoft recordings or to replace them.

Before you begin, be aware of the following restrictions:

* The supported file formats are .wav and .mp3.
* The file size limit is 1 MB.
* Authentication messages should be shorter than 20 seconds. Messages that are longer than 20 seconds can cause the verification to fail. If the user doesn't respond before the message finishes, the verification times out.

### Custom message language behavior

When a custom voice message is played to the user, the language of the message depends on the following factors:

* The language of the user.
  * The language detected by the user's browser.
  * Other authentication scenarios might behave differently.
* The language of any available custom messages.
  * This language is chosen by the administrator when a custom message is added.

For example, if there's only one custom message, and it's in German:

* A user who authenticates in the German language will hear the custom German message.
* A user who authenticates in English will hear the standard English message.

### Custom voice message defaults

You can use the following sample scripts to create your own custom messages. These phrases are the defaults if you don't configure your own custom messages.

| Message name | Script |
| --- | --- |
| Authentication successful | Your sign-in was successfully verified. Goodbye. |
| Extension prompt | Thank you for using Microsoft's sign-in verification system. Please press the pound key to continue. |
| Fraud confirmation | A fraud alert has been submitted. To unblock your account, please contact your company's IT help desk. |
| Fraud greeting (standard) | Thank you for using Microsoft's sign-in verification system. Please press the pound key to finish your verification. If you did not initiate this verification, someone may be trying to access your account. Please press zero pound to submit a fraud alert. This will notify your company's IT team and block further verification attempts. |
| Fraud reported  |  A fraud alert has been submitted. To unblock your account, please contact your company's IT help desk. |
| Activation | Thank you for using the Microsoft sign-in verification system. Please press the pound key to finish your verification. |
| Authentication denied retry | Verification denied. |
| Retry (standard) | Thank you for using the Microsoft sign-in verification system. Please press the pound key to finish your verification. |
| Greeting (standard) | Thank you for using the Microsoft sign-in verification system. Please press the pound key to finish your verification. |
| Greeting (PIN) | Thank you for using Microsoft's sign-in verification system. Please enter your PIN followed by the pound key to finish your verification. |
| Fraud greeting (PIN) | Thank you for using Microsoft's sign-in verification system.  Please enter your PIN followed by the pound key to finish your verification. If you did not initiate this verification, someone may be trying to access your account. Please press zero pound to submit a fraud alert. This will notify your company's IT team and block further verification attempts. |
| Retry (PIN) | Thank you for using Microsoft's sign-in verification system. Please enter your PIN followed by the pound key to finish your verification. |
| Extension prompt after digits | If already at this extension, press the pound key to continue. |
| Authentication denied | I'm sorry, we cannot sign you in at this time. Please try again later. |
| Activation greeting (standard) | Thank you for using the Microsoft sign-in verification system. Please press the pound key to finish your verification. |
| Activation retry (standard) | Thank you for using the Microsoft sign-in verification system. Please press the pound key to finish your verification. |
| Activation greeting (PIN) | Thank you for using Microsoft's sign-in verification system. Please enter your PIN followed by the pound key to finish your verification. |
| Extension prompt before digits | Thank you for using Microsoft's sign-in verification system. Please transfer this call to extension \<extension>. |

### Set up a custom message

To use your own custom messages, complete the following steps:

1. Go to **Protection** > **Multifactor authentication** > **Phone call settings**.
1. Select **Add greeting**.
1. Choose the **Type** of greeting, such as **Greeting (standard)** or  **Authentication successful**.
1. Select the **Language**. See the previous section on [custom message language behavior](#custom-message-language-behavior).
1. Browse for and select an .mp3 or .wav sound file to upload.
1. Select **Add** and then **Save**.

## MFA service settings

Settings for app passwords, trusted IPs, verification options, and remembering multifactor authentication on trusted devices are available in the service settings. This is a legacy portal.

You can access service settings from the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) by going to **Protection** > **Multifactor authentication** > **Getting started** > **Configure** > **Additional cloud-based MFA settings**. A window or tab opens with additional service settings options.

### Trusted IPs

Location conditions are the recommended way to configure MFA with Conditional Access because of IPv6 support and other improvements. For more information about location conditions, see [Using the location condition in a Conditional Access policy](/entra/identity/conditional-access/location-condition#location-condition-in-policy). For steps to define locations and create a Conditional Access policy, see [Conditional Access: Block access by location](/entra/identity/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-location).

The trusted IPs feature of Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication also bypasses MFA prompts for users who sign in from a defined IP address range. You can set trusted IP ranges for your on-premises environments. When users are in one of these locations, there's no Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication prompt. The trusted IPs feature requires Microsoft Entra ID P1 edition. 

> [!NOTE]
> The trusted IPs can include private IP ranges only when you use MFA Server. For cloud-based Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication, you can use only public IP address ranges.
>
> IPv6 ranges are supported in [named locations](../conditional-access/concept-assignment-network.md#ipv4-and-ipv6-address-ranges).

If your organization uses the NPS extension to provide MFA to on-premises applications, the source IP address will always appear to be the NPS server that the authentication attempt flows through.

| Microsoft Entra tenant type | Trusted IP feature options |
|:--- |:--- |
| Managed |**Specific range of IP addresses**: Administrators specify a range of IP addresses that can bypass multifactor authentications for users who sign in from the company intranet. A maximum of 50 trusted IP ranges can be configured.|
| Federated |**All Federated Users**: All federated users who sign in from inside the organization can bypass multifactor authentications. Users bypass verifications by using a claim that's issued by Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS).<br/>**Specific range of IP addresses**: Administrators specify a range of IP addresses that can bypass multifactor authentication for users who sign in from the company intranet. |

Trusted IP bypass works only from inside the company intranet. If you select the **All Federated Users** option and a user signs in from outside the company intranet, the user has to authenticate by using multifactor authentication. The process is the same even if the user presents an AD FS claim.

>[!NOTE]
>If both per-user MFA and Conditional Access policies are configured in the tenant, you need to add trusted IPs to the Conditional Access policy and update the MFA service settings.

#### User experience inside the corporate network

When the trusted IPs feature is disabled, multifactor authentication is required for browser flows. App passwords are required for older rich-client applications.

When trusted IPs are used, multifactor authentication isn't required for browser flows. App passwords aren't required for older rich-client applications if the user hasn't created an app password. After an app password is in use, the password is required.

#### User experience outside the corporate network

Regardless of whether trusted IPs are defined, multifactor authentication is required for browser flows. App passwords are required for older rich-client applications.

#### Enable named locations by using Conditional Access

You can use Conditional Access rules to define named locations by using the following steps:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Conditional Access Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#conditional-access-administrator).
1. Browse to **Protection** > **Conditional Access** > **Named locations**.
1. Select **New location**.
1. Enter a name for the location.
1. Select **Mark as trusted location**.
1. Enter the IP range for your environment in CIDR notation. For example, *40.77.182.32/27*.
1. Select **Create**.

#### Enable the trusted IPs feature by using Conditional Access

To enable trusted IPs by using Conditional Access policies, complete the following steps:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Conditional Access Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#conditional-access-administrator).
1. Browse to **Protection** >  **Conditional Access** > **Named locations**.
1. Select **Configure multifactor authentication trusted IPs**.
1. On the **Service Settings** page, under **Trusted IPs**, choose one of these options:

   * **For requests from federated users originating from my intranet**: To choose this option, select the checkbox. All federated users who sign in from the corporate network bypass multifactor authentications by using a claim that's issued by AD FS. Ensure that AD FS has a rule to add the intranet claim to the appropriate traffic. If the rule doesn't exist, create the following rule in AD FS:

      `c:[Type== "https://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2012/01/insidecorporatenetwork"] => issue(claim = c);`

     >[!NOTE]
     >The **Skip multifactor authentication for requests from federated users on my intranet** option will affect the Conditional Access evaluation for locations. Any request with the **insidecorporatenetwork** claim would be treated as coming from a Trusted location if that option is selected.

   * **For requests from a specific range of public IPs**: To choose this option, enter the IP addresses in the text box, in CIDR notation.
      * For IP addresses that are in the range *xxx.xxx.xxx*.1 through *xxx.xxx.xxx*.254, use notation like ***xxx.xxx.xxx*.0/24**.
      * For a single IP address, use notation like ***xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx*/32**.
      * Enter up to 50 IP address ranges. Users who sign in from these IP addresses bypass multifactor authentications.

1. Select **Save**.

#### Enable the trusted IPs feature by using service settings

If you don't want to use Conditional Access policies to enable trusted IPs, you can configure the service settings for Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication by using the following steps:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least an [Authentication Policy Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#authentication-policy-administrator).
1. Browse to **Protection** > **Multifactor authentication** > **Additional cloud-based MFA settings**. 
1. On the **Service settings** page, under **Trusted IPs**, choose one or both of the following options:

   * **For requests from federated users on my intranet**: To choose this option, select the checkbox. All federated users who sign in from the corporate network bypass multifactor authentication by using a claim that's issued by AD FS. Ensure that AD FS has a rule to add the intranet claim to the appropriate traffic. If the rule doesn't exist, create the following rule in AD FS:

      `c:[Type== "https://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2012/01/insidecorporatenetwork"] => issue(claim = c);` 

   * **For requests from a specified range of IP address subnets**: To choose this option, enter the IP addresses in the text box, in CIDR notation.
      * For IP addresses that are in the range *xxx.xxx.xxx*.1 through *xxx.xxx.xxx*.254, use notation like ***xxx.xxx.xxx*.0/24**.
      * For a single IP address, use notation like ***xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx*/32**.
      * Enter up to 50 IP address ranges. Users who sign in from these IP addresses bypass multifactor authentications.

1. Select **Save**.

### Verification methods

You can choose the verification methods that are available for your users in the service settings portal. When your users enroll their accounts for Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication, they choose their preferred verification method from the options that you've enabled. Guidance for the user enrollment process is provided in [Set up my account for multifactor authentication](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/how-to-use-the-microsoft-authenticator-app-9783c865-0308-42fb-a519-8cf666fe0acc).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>In March 2023, we announced the deprecation of managing authentication methods in the legacy multifactor authentication and self-service password reset (SSPR) policies. Beginning September 30, 2025, authentication methods can't be managed in these legacy MFA and SSPR policies. We recommend customers use the manual migration control to migrate to the Authentication methods policy by the deprecation date. For help with the migration control, see [How to migrate MFA and SSPR policy settings to the Authentication methods policy for Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/identity/authentication/how-to-authentication-methods-manage).

The following verification methods are available:

| Method | Description |
|:--- |:--- |
| Call to phone |Places an automated voice call. The user answers the call and presses # on the phone to authenticate. The phone number isn't synchronized to on-premises Active Directory. |
| Text message to phone |Sends a text message that contains a verification code. The user is prompted to enter the verification code into the sign-in interface. This process is called one-way SMS. Two-way SMS means that the user must text back a particular code. Two-way SMS is deprecated and not supported after November 14, 2018. Administrators should enable another method for users who previously used two-way SMS.|
| Notification through mobile app |Sends a push notification to the user's phone or registered device. The user views the notification and selects **Verify** to complete verification. The Microsoft Authenticator app is available for [Windows Phone](https://www.microsoft.com/p/microsoft-authenticator/9nblgggzmcj6), [Android](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=825072), and [iOS](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=825073). |
| Verification code from mobile app or hardware token |The Microsoft Authenticator app generates a new OATH verification code every 30 seconds. The user enters the verification code into the sign-in interface. The Microsoft Authenticator app is available for [Windows Phone](https://www.microsoft.com/p/microsoft-authenticator/9nblgggzmcj6), [Android](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=825072), and [iOS](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=825073). |

### Remember multifactor authentication

 The **remember multifactor authentication** feature lets users bypass subsequent verifications for a specified number of days, after they've successfully signed in to a device by using MFA. To enhance usability and minimize the number of times a user has to perform MFA on a given device, select a duration of 90 days or more.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If an account or device is compromised, remembering MFA for trusted devices can affect security. If a corporate account becomes compromised or a trusted device is lost or stolen, you should [Revoke MFA Sessions](howto-mfa-userdevicesettings.yml).
>
> The revoke action revokes the trusted status from all devices, and the user is required to perform multifactor authentication again. You can also instruct your users to restore the original MFA status on their own devices as noted in [Manage your settings for multifactor authentication](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/change-your-two-step-verification-method-and-settings-c801d5ad-e0fc-4711-94d5-33ad5d4630f7#turn-on-two-factor-verification-prompts-on-a-trusted-device).

#### How the feature works

The **remember multifactor authentication** feature sets a persistent cookie on the browser when a user selects the **Don't ask again for *X* days** option at sign-in. The user isn't prompted again for MFA from that browser until the cookie expires. If the user opens a different browser on the same device or clears the cookies, they're prompted again to verify.

The **Don't ask again for *X* days** option isn't shown on non-browser applications, regardless of whether the app supports modern authentication. These apps use *refresh tokens* that provide new access tokens every hour. When a refresh token is validated, Microsoft Entra ID checks that the last multifactor authentication occurred within the specified number of days.

The feature reduces the number of authentications on web apps, which normally prompt every time. The feature can increase the number of authentications for modern authentication clients that normally prompt every 180 days, if a lower duration is configured. It might also increase the number of authentications when combined with Conditional Access policies.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **remember multifactor authentication** feature isn't compatible with the **keep me signed in** feature of AD FS, when users perform multifactor authentication for AD FS through MFA Server or a third-party multifactor authentication solution.
>
> If your users select **keep me signed in** on AD FS and also mark their device as trusted for MFA, the user isn't automatically verified after the **remember multifactor authentication** number of days expires. Microsoft Entra ID requests a fresh multifactor authentication, but AD FS returns a token with the original MFA claim and date, rather than performing multifactor authentication again. *This reaction sets off a verification loop between Microsoft Entra ID and AD FS.*
>
> The **remember multifactor authentication** feature isn't compatible with B2B users and won't be visible for B2B users when they sign in to the invited tenants.
>
> The **remember multifactor authentication** feature isn't compatible with the Sign-in frequency Conditional Access control. For more information, see [Configure authentication session management with Conditional Access](~/identity/conditional-access/concept-session-lifetime.md#configuring-authentication-session-controls).

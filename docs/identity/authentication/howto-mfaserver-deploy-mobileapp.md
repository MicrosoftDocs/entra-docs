# Enable mobile app authentication with Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server

The Microsoft Authenticator app offers an extra out-of-band verification option. Instead of placing an automated phone call or SMS to the user during login, Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication pushes a notification to the Authenticator app on the user's smartphone or tablet. The user simply taps **Verify** (or enters a PIN and taps "Authenticate") in the app to complete their sign-in.

Using a mobile app for two-step verification is preferred when phone reception is unreliable. If you use the app as an OATH token generator, it doesn't require any network or internet connection.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In September 2022, Microsoft announced deprecation of Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server. Beginning September 30, 2024, Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server deployments will no longer service multifactor authentication requests, which could cause authentications to fail for your organization. To ensure uninterrupted authentication services and to remain in a supported state, organizations should [migrate their usersâ€™ authentication data](how-to-migrate-mfa-server-to-mfa-user-authentication.md) to the cloud-based Azure MFA service by using the latest Migration Utility included in the most recent [Azure MFA Server update](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=55849). For more information, see [Azure MFA Server Migration](how-to-migrate-mfa-server-to-azure-mfa.md).  

> To get started with cloud-based MFA, see [Tutorial: Secure user sign-in events with Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication](tutorial-enable-azure-mfa.md).


> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have installed Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server v8.x or higher, most of the steps below are not required. Mobile app authentication can be set up by following the steps under [Configure the mobile app](#configure-the-mobile-app-settings-in-mfa-server).

## Requirements

To use the Authenticator app, you must be running Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server v8.x or higher

## Configure the mobile app settings in MFA Server

1. In the MFA Server console, select the **User Portal** icon. If users are allowed to control their authentication methods, check **Mobile App** on the Settings tab, under **Allow users to select method**. Without this feature enabled, end users are required to contact your Help Desk to complete activation for the Mobile App.
2. Check the **Allow users to activate Mobile App** box.
3. Check the **Allow User Enrollment** box.
4. Click the **Mobile App** icon.
5. Populate the **Account name** field with the company or organization name to display in the mobile application for this account.

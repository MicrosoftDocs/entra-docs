      - question: |
          Can I use Authenticator as a passkey provider on devices earlier than Android 14 or iOS 17?
        answer: |
          Authenticator uses operating system APIs as a passkey provider. These APIs are available only on devices that run Android 14 and iOS 17 or later. As a result, passkeys in Authenticator are only available on devices that run Android 14 or iOS 17 and later.
      - question: |
          Do I need to enable bluetooth to perform cross-device authentication?
        answer: |
          To complete cross-device authentication using passkeys in Authenticator, you must enable bluetooth on both the laptop and the mobile device, and both devices must also be connected to the internet. 
      - question: |
          Can I have multiple passkeys in Authenticator?
        answer: |        
          You can only have one passkey for each account in Authenticator. At this time, Authenticator only supports passkeys for Microsoft Entra ID.
      - question: |
          Can I use Authenticator app camera to scan the WebAuthn QR code for registration and authentication?
        answer: |
          You can use the Authenticator camera on Android to register and authenticate with passkeys. This option is useful if your organization hasn't pushed the system camera app to Android Work Profile. This capability isn't supported in the Authenticator app on iOS at this time.  
      - question: |
          Can I use passkeys in Authenticator without an internet connection?
        answer: |
          You can't use passkeys without an internet connection. 
          For same-device scenarios, the mobile device that contains the passkey must be connected to the internet. 
          For cross-device scenarios, both the device with the passkey and the secondary device you are authenticating on must be connected to the internet.

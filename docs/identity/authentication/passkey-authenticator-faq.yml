    questions:
      - question: |
          Do I need to enable Bluetooth to perform cross-device authentication?
        answer: |
          To complete cross-device authentication by using passkeys in Authenticator, you must enable Bluetooth on both the laptop and the mobile device. Both devices need internet access. 
      - question: |
          Can I have multiple passkeys in Authenticator?
        answer: |        
          You can have only one passkey for each account in Authenticator. At this time, Authenticator only supports passkeys for Microsoft Entra ID.
      - question: |
          Can I use the Authenticator app camera to scan the WebAuthn QR code for registration and authentication?
        answer: |
          You can use the Authenticator camera to register and authenticate with passkeys. This option is useful if your organization doesn't push the system camera app to Android Work Profile. 
      - question: |
          Can I use passkeys in Authenticator without an internet connection?
        answer: |
          You can't use passkeys without an internet connection. 
          For same-device scenarios, the mobile device that contains the passkey needs internet access. 
          For cross-device scenarios, both the device with the passkey and the secondary device where you want to sign in need internet access.
      - question: |
          Why is cross-device registration failing with "Device couldn't connect"?
        answer: |
          Make sure that Bluetooth and an active internet connection are enabled on both devices. 
          Also, allow connectivity to these two endpoints in your organization to enable cross-device registration and authentication:

      - question: |
          I'm on an Android 14 device, and I followed all the steps. Why can't I register passkeys in the Authenticator app?
        answer: |
          The Authenticator app uses [Android APIs](https://developer.android.com/identity/sign-in/credential-provider) on Android 14 or higher to use passkeys. 
          Manufacturers choose whether or not to implement these APIs for each device they make. 
          If your device doesn't support these APIs, the Authenticator app might not work for your device on Android 14. 
          For the best experience, we recommend that you upgrade to Android 15.
      - question: |
          Can I sign in with a passkey in Authenticator in China?
        answer: |

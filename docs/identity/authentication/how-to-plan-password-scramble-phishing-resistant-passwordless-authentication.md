# Remove password usage from Entra

Passwords are one of the least secure authentication methods available. They are vulnerable to a wide range of threatsâ€”including phishing, credential stuffing, brute-force attacks, and social engineering. To realize the benefits of passwordless authentication in Microsoft Entra ID, you must ensure passwords are no longer available as a sign-in option in your tenant.

Password scrambling ensures that users can't authenticate using passwords. It forces them to use more secure phishing-resistant passwordless credentials, like Windows Hello for Business, FIDO2 security keys, or Passkey in Microsoft Authenticator. Since there is no known reference of the password after scrambling, it reduces the attack surface for bad actors.

This article provides guidance about how to scramble passwords for both hybrid users who are synced from on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and cloud-only users in Microsoft Entra ID.
 

## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Entra Connect sync [version 2.4.18.0 or later](~/identity/hybrid/connect/how-to-connect-password-hash-synchronization.md#password-hash-synchronization-and-smart-card-authentication)

## Scramble passwords for hybrid user accounts synced from on-premises AD DS

Organizations with users synced from on-premises AD DS to Microsoft Entra ID should scramble user passwords in the on-premises environment, as on-premises is the source of authority for synced user accounts and their passwords. If your organization uses [cloud authentication](~/identity/hybrid/connect/choose-ad-authn.md) and syncs password hashes to Microsoft Entra ID, then these scrambled passwords are also synced to the cloud. The sync process ensures that users aren't aware of their passwords in either on-premises or the cloud, preventing their use and driving users towards using more secure phishing-resistant passwordless credentials.


### Scramble on-premises user passwords with a scripted random value

In Active Directory, it is not possible to remove a password attribute from a user account. Therefore to prevent usage of the password you can scramble the password peridoically.

If you have legacy applications that still require a password for authentication, users can continue to use self-service password reset (SSPR) to set their password known state password to access these apps for a period of time, until their password is scrambled again.

You can use the following script to routinely scramble any passwords that users reset back to a known state.

 
The following sample PowerShell script allows you to scramble a users password on your AD DS domain. It will generate a random password of 64 characters and set it for the user specified in the variable name $samAccountName. You must modify the $samAccountName variable in the script to target the appropriate user. Use the credentials of an admin account with appropriate permissions in on-premises AD DS.

> [!CAUTION]
> Execute the script only from a secure and trusted environment, and ensure that the script isn't logged. Treat the host where the script is executed as a privileged host, with the same level of security as a domain controller.
```PowerShell
$samAccountName = <sAMAccountName of the user>

Import-Module ActiveDirectory

function Generate-RandomPassword{
    [CmdletBinding()]
    param (
      [int]$Length = 64
    )
  $chars = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#$%^&*()-_=+[]{};:,.<>/?\|`~"
  $random = New-Object System.Random
  $password = ""
  for ($i = 0; $i -lt $Length; $i++) {
    $index = $random.Next(0, $chars.Length)
    $password += $chars[$index]
  }
  return $password
}

Import-Module ActiveDirectory

$NewPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString -String (Generate-RandomPassword) -AsPlainText -Force

Set-ADAccountPassword -Identity $samAccountName -NewPassword $NewPassword -Reset
```

> [!Note]
> If your password scrambling script runs less frequently than your current password age policy, than you should consider increasing password age to be greater than this frequency, or setting password age to 0, which would disable password expiration.

## Randomize passwords for cloud user accounts in Microsoft Entra ID

Cloud-based passwordless users should have their password set to a random value. Randomizing the password prevents the user from knowing the password and using it to authenticate. Optionally, organizations can allow end users to reset their password if they encounter an application where they need the password. Run the script routinely to scramble any passwords that users have reset back to a known state.

The following sample PowerShell script generates a random password of 64 characters and sets it for the user specified in the variable name **$userId** against Microsoft Entra ID. Modify the **$userId** variable of the script to match your environment, and then run it in a PowerShell session. When prompted to authenticate to Microsoft Entra ID, use the credentials of an account with a role that can reset passwords.

```PowerShell
$userId = "<UPN of the user>"

function Generate-RandomPassword{
    [CmdletBinding()]
    param (
      [int]$Length = 64
    )
  $chars = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#$%^&*()-_=+[]{};:,.<>/?\|`~"
  $random = New-Object System.Random
  $password = ""
  for ($i = 0; $i -lt $Length; $i++) {
    $index = $random.Next(0, $chars.Length)
    $password += $chars[$index]
  }
  return $password
}

Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser -Force
Install-Module Microsoft.Graph -Scope CurrentUser
Import-Module Microsoft.Graph.Users.Actions
Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite.All" -NoWelcome

$passwordParams = @{
 UserId = $userId
 AuthenticationMethodId = "28c10230-6103-485e-b985-444c60001490"
 NewPassword = Generate-RandomPassword
}

Reset-MgUserAuthenticationMethodPassword @passwordParams
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Execute the script only from a secure and trusted environment, and ensure that the script isn't logged. Treat the host where the script is executed as a privileged host, with the same level of security as a domain controller.

## More considerations for organizations that completely enforce phishing-resistant authentication

If your organization no longer needs passwords whatsoever, because all applications and scenarios are compatible with passwordless credentials, then you may no longer need to provide users with self-service password recovery options. Consider disabling tools that let users override the scrambled passwords and gain access to their password again.

- Disable self-service password reset (SSPR) tools, including [Microsoft Entra self-service password reset](~/identity/authentication/tutorial-enable-sspr-writeback.md#clean-up-resources).
- Disable password writeback from [Microsoft Entra to on-premises Active Directory](~/identity/authentication/tutorial-enable-sspr-writeback.md#clean-up-resources).
- Set your Microsoft Entra password policy to have [no expiry](~/identity/authentication/concept-sspr-policy.md).

# Reporting options for Microsoft Entra password management

After deployment, many organizations want to know how or if self-service password reset (SSPR) is really being used. The reporting feature that Microsoft Entra ID provides helps you answer questions by using prebuilt reports. If you're appropriately licensed, you can also create custom queries.

![Reporting on SSPR using the audit logs in Microsoft Entra ID][Reporting]

The following questions can be answered by the reports that exist in the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com):

> [!NOTE]
> You must be [a Global Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md), and you must opt-in for this data to be gathered on behalf of your organization. To opt in, you must visit the **Reporting** tab or the audit logs at least once. Until then, data is not collected for your organization.
>

* How many people have registered for password reset?
* Who has registered for password reset?
* What data are people registering?
* How many people reset their passwords in the last seven days?
* What are the most common methods that  users or admins use to reset their passwords?
* What are common problems users or admins face when attempting to use password reset?
* What admins are resetting their own passwords frequently?
* Is there any suspicious activity going on with password reset?

## How to view password management reports

[!INCLUDE [portal updates](~/includes/portal-update.md)]

Use the following the steps to find the password reset and password reset registration events:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as a [Global Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#global-administrator).
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Users**.
5. Select **Audit Logs** from the **Users** blade. This shows you all of the audit events that occurred against all the users in your directory. You can filter this view to see all the password-related events.
6. From the **Filter** menu at the top of the pane, select the **Service** drop-down list, and change it to the **Self-service Password Management** service type.
7. Optionally, further filter the list by choosing the specific **Activity** you're interested in.

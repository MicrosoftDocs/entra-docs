# Web browser cookies used in Microsoft Entra authentication

During authentication against Microsoft Entra ID through a web browser, multiple cookies are involved in the process. Some of the cookies are common on all requests. Other cookies are used for specific authentication flows or specific client-side conditions.  

Persistent session tokens are stored as persistent cookies on the web browser's cookie jar. Non-persistent session tokens are stored as session cookies on the web browser, and are destroyed when the browser session is closed. 

<!--Cookie name "buid" in the table that follows is correct do not replace with "build"-->
 
|  Cookie Name | Type | Comments |
|--|--|--|
| ESTSAUTH | Common | Contains user's session information to facilitate SSO. Transient. |
| ESTSAUTHPERSISTENT | Common | Contains user's session information to facilitate SSO. Persistent. |
| ESTSAUTHLIGHT | Common  | Contains Session GUID Information. Lite session state cookie used exclusively by client-side JavaScript in order to facilitate OIDC sign-out. Security feature. |
| SignInStateCookie | Common | Contains list of services accessed to facilitate sign-out. No user information. Security feature. |
| CCState | Common | Contains session information state to be used between Microsoft Entra ID and the [Microsoft Entra Backup Authentication Service](~/identity/conditional-access/resilience-defaults.md). |

| ESTSSC | Common | Legacy cookie containing session count information no longer used. |
| ESTSSSOTILES | Common | Tracks session sign-out. When present and not expired, with value "ESTSSSOTILES=1", it interrupts SSO, for specific SSO authentication model, and presents tiles for user account selection. |
| AADSSOTILES | Common | Tracks session sign-out. Similar to ESTSSSOTILES but for other specific SSO authentication model. |
| ESTSUSERLIST | Common | Tracks Browser SSO user's list. |
| SSOCOOKIEPULLED | Common | Prevents looping on specific scenarios. No user information. |

| x-ms-refreshtokencredential | Specific | Available when [Primary Refresh Token (PRT)](~/identity/devices/concept-primary-refresh-token.md) is in use. |
| estsStateTransient | Specific | Applicable to new session information model only. Transient. |

| ESTSNCLOGIN | Specific | National Cloud Login related Cookie. | 
| UsGovTraffic | Specific | US Gov Cloud Traffic Cookie. | 
| ESTSWCTXFLOWTOKEN | Specific | Saves flowToken information when redirecting to ADFS. |
| CcsNtv | Specific | To control when Microsoft Entra Gateway sends requests to [Microsoft Entra Backup Authentication Service](~/identity/conditional-access/resilience-defaults.md). Native flows. | 
| CcsWeb | Specific | To control when Microsoft Entra Gateway sends requests to [Microsoft Entra Backup Authentication Service](~/identity/conditional-access/resilience-defaults.md). Web flows. | 
| Ccs* | Specific | Cookies with prefix Ccs*, have the same purpose as the ones without prefix, but only apply when [Microsoft Entra Backup Authentication Service](~/identity/conditional-access/resilience-defaults.md) is in use. | 
| threxp | Specific | Used for throttling control. | 
| rrc | Specific | Cookie used to identify a recent B2B invitation redemption. |

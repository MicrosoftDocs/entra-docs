# Get started with phishing-resistant passwordless authentication deployment in Microsoft Entra ID

Passwords are the primary attack vector for modern adversaries, and a source of friction for users and administrators. As part of an overall [Zero Trust security strategy](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/zero-trust), Microsoft recommends [moving to phishing-resistant passwordless](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/solutions/passwordless-authentication) in your authentication solution. This guide helps you select, prepare, and deploy the right phishing-resistant passwordless credentials for your organization. Use this guide to plan and execute your phishing-resistant passwordless project.

Features like multifactor authentication (MFA) are a great way to secure your organization. But users often get frustrated with the extra security layer on top of their need to remember passwords. Phishing-resistant passwordless authentication methods are more convenient. For example, an analysis of Microsoft consumer accounts shows that sign-in with a password can take up to 9 seconds on average, but passkeys only take around 3 seconds in most cases. The speed and ease of passkey sign-in is even greater when compared with traditional password and MFA sign in. Passkey users don’t need to remember their password, or wait around for SMS messages.

>This data is based on analysis of Microsoft consumer account sign-ins.

Phishing-resistant passwordless methods also have extra security baked in. They automatically count as MFA by using something that the user has (a physical device or security key) and something the user knows or is, like a biometric or PIN. And unlike traditional MFA, phishing-resistant passwordless methods deflect phishing attacks against your users by using hardware-backed credentials that can’t be easily compromised. 

Microsoft Entra ID offers the following phishing-resistant passwordless authentication options:

- Passkeys (FIDO2)
  - Windows Hello for Business
  - Platform credential for macOS (preview)
  - Microsoft Authenticator app passkeys
  - FIDO2 security keys
  - Other passkeys and providers, such as iCloud Keychain - [**_on roadmap_**](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/public-preview-expanding-passkey-support-in-microsoft-entra-id/ba-p/4062702)
- Certificate-based authentication/smart cards

## Prerequisites

Before you start your Microsoft Entra phishing-resistant passwordless deployment project, complete these prerequisites: 

- Review license requirements
- Review the roles needed to perform privileged actions
- Identify stakeholder teams that need to collaborate

### License requirements

Registration and passwordless sign in with Microsoft Entra doesn't require a license, but we recommend at least a Microsoft Entra ID P1 license for the full set of capabilities associated with a passwordless deployment. For example, a Microsoft Entra ID P1 license helps you enforce passwordless sign in through Conditional Access, and track deployment with an authentication method activity report. Refer to the licensing requirements guidance for features referenced in this guide for specific licensing requirements.

### Integrate apps with Microsoft Entra ID

Microsoft Entra ID is a cloud-based Identity and Access Management (IAM) service that integrates with many types of applications, including Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) apps, line-of-business (LOB) apps, on-premises apps, and more. You need to integrate your applications with Microsoft Entra ID to get the most benefit from your investment in passwordless and phishing-resistant authentication. As you integrate more apps with Microsoft Entra ID, you can protect more of your environment with Conditional Access policies that enforce the use of phishing-resistant authentication methods. To learn more about how to integrate apps with Microsoft Entra ID, see [Five steps to integrate your apps with Microsoft Entra ID](~/fundamentals/five-steps-to-full-application-integration.md).

When you develop your own applications, follow the developer guidance for supporting passwordless and phishing-resistant authentication. For more information, see [Support passwordless authentication with FIDO2 keys in apps you develop](~/identity-platform/support-fido2-authentication.md).
 
### Required roles

The following table lists least privileged role requirements for phishing-resistant passwordless deployment. We recommend that you enable phishing-resistant passwordless authentication for all privileged accounts.

Microsoft Entra role                | Description
------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------
[User Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#user-administrator) | To implement combined registration experience
[Authentication Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#authentication-administrator) | To implement and manage authentication methods
[Authentication Policy Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#authentication-policy-administrator) | To implement and manage the Authentication methods policy
User                                | To configure Authenticator app on device; to enroll security key device for web or Windows 10/11 sign-in

### Customer stakeholder teams

To ensure success, make sure that you engage with the right stakeholders, and that they understand their roles before you begin your planning and rollout. The following table lists commonly recommended stakeholder teams.

Stakeholder team                    | Description
------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------
Identity and Access Management (IAM) | Manages day-to-day operations of the IAM system
Information Security Architecture	   | Plans and designs the organization’s information security practices
Information Security Operations	     | Runs and monitors information security practices for Information Security Architecture
Security Assurance and Audit         | Helps ensure IT processes are secure and compliant. They conduct regular audits, assess risks, and recommend security measures to mitigate identified vulnerabilities and enhance the overall security posture.
Help Desk and Support	               | Assists end users who encounter issues during deployments of new technologies and policies, or when issues occur 
End-User Communications	             | Messages changes to end users in preparation to aid in driving user-facing technology rollouts

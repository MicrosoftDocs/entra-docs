## [**iOS**](#tab/iOS)

To sign in with a passkey in Microsoft Authenticator, your iOS device needs to run iOS 17 or later.

### Same-device authentication in a browser (iOS)

Follow these steps to sign in to Microsoft Entra ID with a passkey in Authenticator on your iOS device. 

1. On your iOS device, open your browser and navigate to the resource you're trying to access such as [Office](https://www.office.com).

1. You can enter your username to sign in:

   If you most recently used a passkey to sign in, you're automatically prompted to sign in with a passkey. Otherwise, select **Other ways to sign in**, and then select **Face**, **fingerprint**, **PIN**, or **security key**.

   Alternatively, click **Sign-in options** to sign in more conveniently without having to enter a username.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you attempt to sign in without a username and multiple passkeys are saved to your device, you're prompted to choose which passkey to use for sign-in. 

1. To select your passkey, follow the steps in the iOS operating system dialog. Verify that it's you by using Face ID, Touch ID, or entering your device PIN.

1. You're now signed into Microsoft Entra ID.

### Cross-device authentication (iOS)

   > [!NOTE]
   > Bluetooth and an internet connection are required for this step and must both be enabled on your mobile and remote device.

1. To select your passkey, follow the steps in the iOS operating system dialog. Verify that it's you by using Face ID, Touch ID, or enter your device PIN.

1. You're now signed into Microsoft Entra ID on your other device.

### Same-device authentication in native Microsoft applications (iOS)

You can use Authenticator on your iOS device to seamlessly sign in with a passkey to other Microsoft apps, such as Microsoft OneDrive, SharePoint, and Outlook. 


## [**Android**](#tab/Android)

To sign in with a passkey in Microsoft Authenticator, your Android device needs to run Android 14 or later.

1. You're now signed into Microsoft Entra ID.


### Cross-device authentication (Android)

Follow these steps to sign in to Microsoft Entra ID on another device with a passkey in Microsoft Authenticator on your Android device.

This sign-in option requires Bluetooth and an internet connection for both devices. If your organization restricts Bluetooth usage, an administrator can allow cross-device sign-in for passkeys by permitting Bluetooth pairing exclusively with passkey-enabled FIDO2 authenticators. For more information about how to configure Bluetooth usage only for passkeys, see [Passkeys in Bluetooth-restricted environments](/windows/security/identity-protection/passkeys/?tabs=windows%2Cintune#passkeys-in-bluetooth-restricted-environments).

1. On the other device where you're looking to sign in to Microsoft Entra ID, navigate to the resource you're trying to access such as [Office](https://www.office.com).

1. You can enter your username to sign in: 

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="media/howto-authenticate-passwordless-passkey-direct-android/sign-in-user-name.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the sign-in with username in Microsoft Authenticator for iOS devices.":::

   If you last used a passkey to authenticate, you're automatically prompted to authenticate with a passkey. Otherwise, you may click on **Other ways to sign in** and then select **Face, fingerprint, PIN, or security key**.

   Alternatively, click **Sign-in options** to sign in more conveniently without having to enter a username. 

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="media/howto-authenticate-passwordless-passkey-direct-android/sign-in-microsoft.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the sign-in Microsoft in Microsoft Authenticator for Android devices.":::

   If you chose **Sign-in options**, select **Face, fingerprint, PIN or security key**. Otherwise, skip to next step.

1. To begin cross-device authentication, follow the steps in the operating system or browser prompt. On Windows 11 23H2 or later, select **iPhone, iPad, or Android device**.

1. A QR code should appear on screen. Now, on your Android device, open the system camera app and scan the QR code. Alternatively, you can also use the camera in Authenticator. Navigate to the passkey account tile and tap on it. Under **Passkey details**, you can see a button in the bottom-right corner to scan the QR code. 
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > Bluetooth and an internet connection are required for this step and both must be enabled on your mobile and remote device.
   > 
   > For quicker sign-in, Android allows you to remember some browsers and Windows devices after scanning the WebAuthn QR code. In such cases, instead of having to scan a QR code each time, you can select the device and receive a notification to continue the passkey authentication.

1. To select your passkey, follow the steps in the Android operating system dialog. Verify that it's you by scanning your face, fingerprint, or enter your device PIN or unlock gesture.

1. On your other device, you're signed into Microsoft Entra ID.

# How to enable the QR code authentication method in Microsoft Entra ID (Preview)

This topic covers how to enable the QR code authentication method in the Authentication methods policy in Microsoft Entra ID. It also covers how to manage the QR code authentication method for users, and how they can sign in with a QR code and PIN. 

## Prerequisites to enable the QR code authentication method

- Microsoft Entra ID tenant with at least an F1, F3, or P1 license. 
- Android, iOS, or iPadOS (iOS/iPadOS version 15.0 or later) shared devices. 
- Shared device mode enabled on the shared devices (optional but highly recommended). 
- A printer to print 2" x 2" QR codes. 
- Teams app installed on the shared device (Android version 1.0.0.2024143204 or later, and iOS version 1.0.0.77.2024132501 or later).
- [Enable and setup My Staff portal](~/identity/role-based-access-control/my-staff-configure.md#how-to-enable-my-staff) if you plan for frontline managers to use My Staff to provision, manage, and reset QR code and PINs. 

## Enable QR code authentication method

You can enable the QR code authentication method by using the Microsoft Entra admin center or Microsoft Graph API. 

### Enable QR code authentication method in the Microsoft Entra admin center

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least an [Authentication Policy Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#authentication-policy-administrator).
1. Go to **Protection** > **Authentication methods** > **Policies**.
1. Click **QR code** > **Enable and target** > **Add target** > select a group of users who need to sign in with a QR code. 

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="media/how-to-authentication-qr-code/enable-qr-code.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to enable QR code for an organization.":::

1. Update default QR code settings as needed:
   - By default, the PIN length is 8 digits. The PIN length can be 8 to 20 digits. If you increase the PIN length, the new value becomes the minimum number of digits required for the PIN. For example, if you increase the PIN length to 10, a user needs to provide a 10-digit PIN during next sign-in.
   - The default lifetime of a standard QR code (provided to the users for long term use) is 365 days. The range is between 1-395 days. You can change the lifetime of a standard QR code for specific user when you add the QR code authentication method for them.

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="media/concept-authentication-qr-code/qr-code-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to updates QR code settings.":::

1. When you're done, click **Save**.

### Enable QR code authentication method in Microsoft Graph API

This example enables QR code authentication for a group, with a PIN length of 10 digits, and a Standard QR code lifetime of 395 days:

- **Request**

  ```https
  PATCH https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/policies/authenticationMethodsPolicy/authenticationMethodConfigurations/qrCodePin
  {
    "@odata.type" : "microsoft.graph.qrCodePinAuthenticationMethodConfiguration", 
    "id": "qrCodePin", 
    "state": "enabled", 
    "includeTargets": [{ 
      "targetType": "group", 
      "id": "b185b746-e7db-4fa2-bafc-69ecf18850dd", 
      }], 
    "excludeTargets": [], 
    "standardQRCodeLifetimeInDays":395,
    "pinLength": 10
  }
  ```

- **Response**

  ```https
  204 No Response
  ```

## Add QR code authentication method for a user

You can add a QR code authentication method for a user by using the Microsoft Entra admin center, My Staff, or Microsoft Graph API. 

### Add QR code authentication method for a user in the Microsoft Entra admin center

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least an [Authentication Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#authentication-administrator).

1. Go to **Users**, select a user, and click **Authentication methods**.

1. Click **Add authentication method** and choose **QR code**.

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="media/how-to-authentication-qr-code/choose-qr-code.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to choose QR code for a user.":::

1. Modify the expiration date for the user if needed. Set **Activation time** to now or later. Provide or generate a temporary PIN. The custom PIN can be specified only when you add the QR code authentication method. A PIN is autogenerated during reset events. When ready, click **Add** to add the QR code authentication method for the user.

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="media/how-to-authentication-qr-code/add-qr-code.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to add QR code for a user.":::

1. Save the PIN, and click **Download image** to download and print the QR code. The QR code image download has the smallest optimal print size. If you reduce the size of the QR code, it may impact QR code scan performance.

   You can't regenerate the same QR code because it has a unique secret. If the QR code can't work for some reason, delete it. Create a new QR code for the user.

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="media/how-to-authentication-qr-code/download-qr-code.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to download the QR code image for a user.":::

1. After you add the QR code authentication method, it appears as a usable authentication method for the user.

## Edit the QR code authentication method for a user

You can edit QR code authentication method for a user by using the Microsoft Entra admin center, My Staff, or Microsoft Graph API. 

### Edit the QR code authentication method for a user in the Microsoft Entra admin center

- Navigate to the usable authentication methods for a user, and click **Edit** to edit the properties of the QR code authentication method.

  :::image type="content" border="true" source="media/how-to-authentication-qr-code/edit-usable-authentication-method.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to edit the usable authentication method for a user.":::

- Change the expiration time for the standard QR code, and click **Save**. After you make edits, click **Done**.

  :::image type="content" border="true" source="media/how-to-authentication-qr-code/change-expiration.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to change the expiration date.":::

- Delete a standard QR code. You might want to delete the standard QR code if it's reported as expired, compromised, or stolen. 
  
  :::image type="content" border="true" source="media/how-to-authentication-qr-code/delete-qr-code.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to delete a QR code.":::

  After you delete the standard QR code, click the add symbol (**+**) to add a new standard QR code for the user. 
  The deleted QR code is no longer valid for login. 
  
  You need to print and distribute the new QR code to the user. 
  The user can continue to use their existing PIN. 

  :::image type="content" border="true" source="media/how-to-authentication-qr-code/replace-qr-code.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to replace a lost or stolen QR code.":::

- Reset a PIN. If you need to reset a user PIN, generate a temporary one and distribute it to the user. The user will be required to change the temporary PIN at the next sign-in. Click the pencil icon after the masked PIN. Click **Generate new PIN** to create a new temporary PIN. Click **OK** to confirm that the user is forced to change the temporary PIN when they next sign in. Copy the temporary PIN and share it with the user. 

  :::image type="content" border="true" source="media/how-to-authentication-qr-code/reset-pin.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to reset a PIN.":::

- Add or delete a temporary QR code. A temporary QR code reduces admin overhead of provisioning and deprovisioning the QR code on a badge if a user didn't bring their badge to work. It also reduces the stress of retaining the QR code after their shift. A temporary QR code has a lifetime of 1-12 hours and can be activated instantly or later. 
To deprovision the QR code, you can delete the temporary QR code or let it expire as it's unusable after expiry.

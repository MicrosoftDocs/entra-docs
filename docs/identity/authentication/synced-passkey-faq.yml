    questions:
      - question: |
          What are the benefits of synced passkeys? 
        answer: |
          Synced passkeys stored in native and third-party passkey providers that already exist on users' devices solve many of the hard issuance and management problems associated with a separate authentication device. 
          The fact that the passkey can sync between the user's client devices and the cloud massively reduces the recoverability and reissuance costs associated with device-bound passkeys. 
          We expect this combination of benefits will make synced passkeys the best option for most users and organizations.
      - question: |
          Can someone other than an employee use the passkeys on their device? 
        answer: |
          Yes, anyone with knowledge of the device PIN can access the passkeys stored on the device. 
          The risk that an employee may share their device with a passkey with a family member is the same, whether the passkey is device-bound or synced. 
          In fact, this risk applies to other MFA methods like SMS and Microsoft Authenticator push notification as well. 
          Organizations will need to teach their users to treat passkeys carefully, like users should with any organization credentials. 
      - question: |
          How can I do a staged rollout of synced passkeys?
        answer: |
          You can leverage passkey profiles to scope the rollout of synced passkeys to select user groups. 
          Microsoft recommends the use of device-bound passkeys for admins and highly privileged users, and the use of synced passkeys for all other users in your organization. 
      - question: |
          As an admin, can I revoke the use of a passkey?  
        answer: |
          Yes. Admins can leverage the per-user authentication methods UX or API to delete the passkey from a user's Microsoft Entra ID account. 
          If an employee reports that their passkey provider account (such as Apple ID, or Google account) was compromised, then this capability can be used to protect the user's Microsoft Entra ID account.

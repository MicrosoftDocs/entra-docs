      - question: |
          What are the benefits of synced passkeys? 
        answer: |
          Synced passkeys stored in native and third-party passkey providers that already exist on users' devices solve many of the hard issuance and management problems associated with a separate authentication device. 
          The fact that the passkey can sync between the user's client devices and the cloud massively reduces the recoverability and reissuance costs associated with device-bound passkeys. 
          We expect this combination of benefits will make synced passkeys the best option for most users and organizations.
      - question: |
          How can I do a staged rollout of synced passkeys?
        answer: |
          You can leverage passkey profiles to scope the rollout of synced passkeys to select user groups. 
          Microsoft recommends the use of device-bound passkeys for admins and highly privileged users, and the use of synced passkeys for all users with non-admin permissions in your organization. 
      - question: |
          As an admin, can I revoke the use of a passkey?  
        answer: |
          Yes. Admins can leverage the per-user authentication methods UX or API to delete the passkey from a user's Microsoft Entra ID account.

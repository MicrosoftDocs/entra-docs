# How to use additional context in Microsoft Authenticator notifications - Authentication methods policy

This topic covers how to improve the security of user sign-in by adding the application name and geographic location of the sign-in to Microsoft Authenticator passwordless and push notifications.  

## Prerequisites

- Your organization needs to enable Microsoft Authenticator passwordless and push notifications for some users or groups by using the new Authentication methods policy. You can edit the Authentication methods policy by using the Microsoft Entra admin center or Microsoft Graph API. 

  >[!NOTE]
  >The policy schema for Microsoft Graph APIs has been improved. The older policy schema is now deprecated. Make sure you use the new schema to help prevent errors.

- Additional context can be targeted to only a single group, which can be dynamic or nested. On-premises synchronized security groups and cloud-only security groups are supported for the Authentication method policy.

## Passwordless phone sign-in and multifactor authentication 

When a user receives a passwordless phone sign-in or MFA push notification in Microsoft Authenticator, they'll see the name of the application that requests the approval and the location based on the IP address where the sign-in originated from.

The additional context can be combined with [number matching](how-to-mfa-number-match.md) to further improve sign-in security.

### Policy schema changes 

You can enable and disable application name and geographic location separately. Under featureSettings, you can use the following name mapping for each feature:

- Application name: displayAppInformationRequiredState
- Geographic location: displayLocationInformationRequiredState

>[!NOTE]
>Make sure you use the new policy schema for Microsoft Graph APIs. In Graph Explorer, you'll need to consent to the **Policy.Read.All** and **Policy.ReadWrite.AuthenticationMethod** permissions. 

Identify your single target group for each of the features. Then use the following API endpoint to change the displayAppInformationRequiredState or displayLocationInformationRequiredState properties under featureSettings to **enabled** and include or exclude the groups you want:

```http
https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/authenticationMethodsPolicy/authenticationMethodConfigurations/MicrosoftAuthenticator
```

#### Example of how to enable additional context for all users

In **featureSettings**, change **displayAppInformationRequiredState** and **displayLocationInformationRequiredState** from **default** to **enabled**. 

The value of Authentication Mode can be either **any** or **push**, depending on whether or not you also want to enable passwordless phone sign-in. In these examples, we'll use **any**, but if you don't want to allow passwordless, use **push**.

You might need to PATCH the entire schema to prevent overwriting any previous configuration. In that case, do a GET first, update only the relevant fields, and then PATCH. The following example shows how to update **displayAppInformationRequiredState** and **displayLocationInformationRequiredState** under **featureSettings**. 

Only users who are enabled for Microsoft Authenticator under Microsoft Authenticator’s **includeTargets** will see the application name or geographic location. Users who aren't enabled for Microsoft Authenticator won't see these features.

```json
//Retrieve your existing policy via a GET. 
//Leverage the Response body to create the Request body section. Then update the Request body similar to the Request body as shown below.
//Change the Query to PATCH and Run query

#### Example of how to enable application name and geographic location for separate groups
 
In **featureSettings**, change **displayAppInformationRequiredState** and **displayLocationInformationRequiredState** from **default** to **enabled.** 
Inside the **includeTarget** for each featureSetting, change the **id** from **all_users** to the ObjectID of the group from the Microsoft Entra admin center.

You need to PATCH the entire schema to prevent overwriting any previous configuration. We recommend that you do a GET first, and then update only the relevant fields and then PATCH. The following example shows an update to **displayAppInformationRequiredState** and **displayLocationInformationRequiredState** under **featureSettings**. 

Only users who are enabled for Microsoft Authenticator under Microsoft Authenticator’s **includeTargets** will see the application name or geographic location. Users who aren't enabled for Microsoft Authenticator won't see these features.

            "includeTarget": {
                "targetType": "group",
                "id": "44561710-f0cb-4ac9-ab9c-e6c394370823"
            },

            },
            "excludeTarget": {
                "targetType": "group",
                "id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
            }
        }
    },

    "includeTargets": [
        {
            "targetType": "group",
            "id": "all_users",
            "isRegistrationRequired": false,
            "authenticationMode": "any",
        }
    ]
}
```
 
To verify, run GET again and verify the ObjectID:

```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/authenticationMethodsPolicy/authenticationMethodConfigurations/MicrosoftAuthenticator
```

#### Example of how to disable application name and only enable geographic location 
 
In **featureSettings**, change the state of **displayAppInformationRequiredState** to **default** or **disabled** and **displayLocationInformationRequiredState** to **enabled.** 
Inside the **includeTarget** for each featureSetting, change the **id** from **all_users** to the ObjectID of the group from the Microsoft Entra admin center.

You need to PATCH the entire schema to prevent overwriting any previous configuration. We recommend that you do a GET first, and then update only the relevant fields and then PATCH. The following example shows an update to **displayAppInformationRequiredState** and **displayLocationInformationRequiredState** under **featureSettings**. 

Only users who are enabled for Microsoft Authenticator under Microsoft Authenticator’s **includeTargets** will see the application name or geographic location. Users who aren't enabled for Microsoft Authenticator won't see these features.

            "authenticationMode": "any",
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Example of how to exclude a group from application name and geographic location 
 
In **featureSettings**, change the states of **displayAppInformationRequiredState** and **displayLocationInformationRequiredState** from **default** to **enabled.** 
Inside the **includeTarget** for each featureSetting, change the **id** from **all_users** to the ObjectID of the group from the Microsoft Entra admin center.

In addition, for each of the features, you'll change the id of the excludeTarget to the ObjectID of the group from the Microsoft Entra admin center. This change excludes that group from seeing application name or geographic location.

You need to PATCH the entire schema to prevent overwriting any previous configuration. We recommend that you do a GET first, and then update only the relevant fields and then PATCH. The following example shows an update to **displayAppInformationRequiredState** and **displayLocationInformationRequiredState** under **featureSettings**. 

Only users who are enabled for Microsoft Authenticator under Microsoft Authenticator’s **includeTargets** will see the application name or geographic location. Users who aren't enabled for Microsoft Authenticator won't see these features.

                "targetType": "group",
                "id": "44561710-f0cb-4ac9-ab9c-e6c394370823"
            },
            "excludeTarget": {
                "targetType": "group",

                "id": "b6bab067-5f28-4dac-ab30-7169311d69e8"
            }
        }
    },

            "isRegistrationRequired": false,
            "authenticationMode": "any",
        }
    ]
}
```
#### Example of removing the excluded group 
 
In **featureSettings**, change the states of **displayAppInformationRequiredState** from **default** to **enabled.** 
You need to change the **id** of the **excludeTarget** to `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`.

You need to PATCH the entire schema to prevent overwriting any previous configuration. We recommend that you do a GET first, and then update only the relevant fields and then PATCH. The following example shows an update to **displayAppInformationRequiredState** and **displayLocationInformationRequiredState** under **featureSettings**. 

Only users who are enabled for Microsoft Authenticator under Microsoft Authenticator’s **includeTargets** will see the application name or geographic location. Users who aren't enabled for Microsoft Authenticator won't see these features.

```json

    "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata#authenticationMethodConfigurations/$entity",
    "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.microsoftAuthenticatorAuthenticationMethodConfiguration",
    "id": "MicrosoftAuthenticator",
    "state": "enabled",
    "featureSettings": {
        " displayAppInformationRequiredState ": {
            "state": "enabled",
            "includeTarget": {
                "targetType": "group",
                "id": "1ca44590-e896-4dbe-98ed-b140b1e7a53a"
            },
            "excludeTarget": {
                "targetType": "group",
                "id": " 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
            }
        }
    },
    "includeTargets@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata#authenticationMethodsPolicy/authenticationMethodConfigurations('MicrosoftAuthenticator')/microsoft.graph.microsoftAuthenticatorAuthenticationMethodConfiguration/includeTargets",
    "includeTargets": [
        {
            "targetType": "group",

            "isRegistrationRequired": false,
            "authenticationMode": "any"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Turn off additional context

To turn off additional context, you'll need to PATCH **displayAppInformationRequiredState** and **displayLocationInformationRequiredState** from **enabled** to **disabled**/**default**. You can also turn off just one of the features.

```json
{
    "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata#authenticationMethodConfigurations/$entity",
    "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.microsoftAuthenticatorAuthenticationMethodConfiguration",
    "id": "MicrosoftAuthenticator",
    "state": "enabled",
    "featureSettings": {
        "displayAppInformationRequiredState": {
            "state": "disabled",
            "includeTarget": {
                "targetType": "group",
                "id": "44561710-f0cb-4ac9-ab9c-e6c394370823"
            },
            "excludeTarget": {
                "targetType": "group",
                "id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
            }
        },
        "displayLocationInformationRequiredState": {
            "state": "disabled",
            "includeTarget": {
                "targetType": "group",

            },
            "excludeTarget": {
                "targetType": "group",
                "id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
            }
        }
    },
    "includeTargets@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata#authenticationMethodsPolicy/authenticationMethodConfigurations('MicrosoftAuthenticator')/microsoft.graph.microsoftAuthenticatorAuthenticationMethodConfiguration/includeTargets",
    "includeTargets": [
        {
            "targetType": "group",
            "id": "all_users",
            "isRegistrationRequired": false,
            "authenticationMode": "any",
        }
    ]
}
```

## Enable additional context in the Microsoft Entra admin center

To enable application name or geographic location in the Microsoft Entra admin center, complete the following steps:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least an [Authentication Policy Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#authentication-policy-administrator).
1. Browse to **Protection** > **Authentication methods** > **Microsoft Authenticator**.
1. On the **Basics** tab, click **Yes** and **All users** to enable the policy for everyone, and change **Authentication mode** to **Any**. 
   
   Only users who are enabled for Microsoft Authenticator here can be included in the policy to show the application name or geographic location of the sign-in, or excluded from it. Users who aren't enabled for Microsoft Authenticator can't see application name or geographic location.

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/how-to-mfa-additional-context/enable-settings-additional-context.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to enable Microsoft Authenticator settings for Any authentication mode.":::

1. On the **Configure** tab, for **Show application name in push and passwordless notifications**, change **Status** to **Enabled**, choose who to include or exclude from the policy, and click **Save**. 

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/how-to-mfa-additional-context/enable-app-name.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to enable application name.":::

   Then do the same for **Show geographic location in push and passwordless notifications**.

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/how-to-mfa-additional-context/enable-geolocation.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to enable geographic location.":::

   You can configure application name and geographic location separately. For example, the following policy enables application name and geographic location for all users but excludes the Operations group from seeing geographic location.

## Known issues

- Additional context isn't supported for Network Policy Server (NPS) or Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS). 
- Users can modify the location reported by iOS and Android devices. As a result, Microsoft Authenticator is updating its security baseline for Location Based Access Control (LBAC) Conditional Access policies. Authenticator will deny authentications where the user may be using a different location than the actual GPS location of the mobile device where Authenticator installed.  

  In the November 2023 release of Authenticator, users who modify the location of their device will see a denial message in Authenticator when doing an LBAC authentication. Beginning January 2024, any users that run older Authenticator versions will be blocked from LBAC authentication with a modified location:
  
  - Authenticator version 6.2309.6329 or earlier on Android
  - Authenticator version 6.7.16 or earlier on iOS
  
  To find which users run older versions of Authenticator, use [Microsoft Graph APIs](/graph/api/resources/microsoftauthenticatorauthenticationmethod#properties).

# Data residency and customer data for Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication

Microsoft Entra ID stores customer data in a geographical location based on the address an organization provides when subscribing to a Microsoft online service such as Microsoft 365 or Azure. For information on where your customer data is stored, see [Where your data is located](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center/privacy/data-location) in the Microsoft Trust Center.

Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication processes and stores personal data and organizational data. This article outlines what and where data is stored.

The Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication service has datacenters in the United States, Europe, and Asia Pacific. The following activities originate from the regional datacenters except where noted:

* Multifactor authentication SMS and phone calls originate from datacenters in the customer's region and are routed by global providers. **These providers may route the SMS or phone call outside of the user and company location.** Phone calls using custom greetings always originate from data centers in the United States.
* General purpose user authentication requests from other regions are currently processed based on the user's location.
* Push notifications that use the Microsoft Authenticator app are currently processed in regional datacenters based on the user's location. Vendor-specific device services, such as Apple Push Notification Service or Google Firebase Cloud Messaging, might be outside the user's location.

# Sign in with a passkey (FIDO2) (preview)

Passkeys are a replacement for your password. With passkeys, you can sign into your Microsoft personal, work or school account using your face, fingerprint, or PIN. Signing in with a passkey is simple, fast, and helps protect you against phishing attacks. For information about FIDO2 support, see [Support for FIDO2 authentication with Microsoft Entra ID](~/identity/authentication/concept-fido2-compatibility.md).

## Sign in to your work or school account

To sign into your work or school account with a passkey, follow these steps when you get a sign-in prompt.

1. Choose **Sign-in Options**.
1. Choose **Face, Fingerprint, PIN, or security key**.
1. Your device opens a security window where you can use your face, fingerprint, PIN, or security key.

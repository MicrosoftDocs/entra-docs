# Register passkeys in Authenticator on Android or iOS devices (preview)

This article shows how to register a passkey using Microsoft Authenticator on your iOS or Android device by directly signing into the Authenticator app or by using [My Security info](https://aka.ms/mysecurityinfo). For more information on the availability of Microsoft Entra ID passkey (FIDO2) authentication across native apps, web browsers, and operating systems, see [Support for FIDO2 authentication with Microsoft Entra ID](concept-fido2-compatibility.md).

**Note that the *easiest and fastest way* to add a passkey is to add it directly in the Authenticator app.**

Alternatively, you can add a passkey from your mobile device browser, or through cross-device registration using another device, such as a laptop. Your mobile device needs to run iOS version 17, or Android version 14, or later.

### Same device registration using direct sign in to Authenticator (iOS)

You can sign in to Authenticator to create a passkey in the app and get seamless Single Sign-on across Microsoft native apps. This is the recommended and preferred flow to setup a passkey in Authenticator. If you're signed in or already have an account in Authenticator, you still need to complete these steps to add a passkey in the app.

1. Open Authenticator.
1. Tap the **Add Account** or **+** button.
   > [!NOTE]
   > If you already have an account in Authenticator, you still need to tap on the **+** button to sign in and register a passkey for that same account.

For example, the passkey provider might not be permitted, or the connection might time out. If you see an error that the passkey already exists, you need to first delete the passkey that was created locally in the Authenticator app before you can retry registration.

# Register passkeys in Authenticator on Android or iOS devices

This article shows how to register a passkey by using Authenticator on your iOS or Android device by directly signing in to the Authenticator app or by using [Security info](https://aka.ms/mysecurityinfo). For more information about the availability of Microsoft Entra ID passkey (FIDO2) authentication across native apps, web browsers, and operating systems, see [Support for FIDO2 authentication with Microsoft Entra ID](concept-fido2-compatibility.md).

*The easiest and fastest way to add a passkey is to add it directly in the Authenticator app.*

Alternatively, you can add a passkey from your mobile device browser or through cross-device registration by using another device, such as a laptop. Your mobile device needs to run iOS version 17 or Android version 14, or later.

## [**iOS**](#tab/iOS)

### Registration by signing in to Authenticator (iOS)

You can sign in to Authenticator to create a passkey in the app and get seamless single sign-on across Microsoft native apps. **We recommend this preferred flow to set up a passkey in Authenticator.** If you're signed in or already have an account in Authenticator, you still need to complete these steps to add a passkey in Authenticator.

1. Download Authenticator from the App Store, and go through the privacy screens.

   - If you installed Authenticator for the first time on your device, on the **Secure Your Digital Life** screen, tap **Add work or school account**.

   - If you installed Authenticator on your device but you didn't add an account, tap **Add account** or the **+** button, and select **Work or school account**. Then tap **Sign in**.

### Passkey registration from Security info (iOS)

By default, **Security info** prompts users to sign in to the Authenticator app to register their passkey.

1. On the same iOS device as the Authenticator or by using another device, such as a laptop, open a web browser and sign in with MFA to [Security info](https://mysignins.microsoft.com/security-info).

### Alternate registration flow from Security info if you have trouble (iOS)

If you can't sign in to Authenticator to register a passkey, you can register directly from **Security info** with WebAuthn. 

> [!NOTE]
> You can't register a passkey in Authenticator this way if attestation is enabled by you administrator. 

If you sign in to **Security info** on a different device, you need Bluetooth and an internet connection. Connectivity to the following two endpoints must be allowed in your organization:

- `https://cable.ua5v.com`
- `https://cable.auth.com`

If your organization restricts Bluetooth usage, you can permit Bluetooth pairing exclusively with passkey-enabled FIDO2 authenticators to allow cross-device registration of passkeys. For more information, see [Passkeys in Bluetooth-restricted environments](/windows/security/identity-protection/passkeys/?tabs=windows%2Cintune#passkeys-in-bluetooth-restricted-environments).

1. On **Security info**, when you add a passkey in Authenticator, tap **Having trouble**.

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="media/howto-register-passwordless-passkey-direct-android/having-trouble-complete.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to register another way if you have trouble.":::

1. Now, tap **create your passkey a different way**.

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="media/howto-register-passwordless-passkey-direct-android/having-trouble.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to register a passkey another way.":::

1. Select **iPhone or iPad**, and go through the rest of the flow to register a passkey on the device.

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="media/howto-register-passwordless-passkey-direct-android/choose-ios-device.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to choose another way on iOS if you have trouble.":::

If a user wants to revert to the original instructions and register a passkey in Authenticator through sign-in:

1. On **Security info**, when you add a passkey in Authenticator, tap **Having trouble**.
1. Now, tap **create your passkey a different way** by signing in to Authenticator.
1. Go through the rest of the flow to register a passkey on your device.

> [!NOTE]
> If you register your passkey with the Chrome browser on macOS, allow `login.microsoft.com` to access your security key or device when prompted.

## Delete your passkey in Authenticator for iOS

To remove the passkey from Authenticator, tap the account name, and then tap **Settings** > **Delete passkey**. You also need to delete your passkey from [Security info](https://mysignins.microsoft.com/security-info).

### Troubleshooting

In some cases when you try to register a passkey, it gets stored locally in the Authenticator app but isn't registered on the authentication server. For example, the passkey provider might not be permitted or the connection might time out. If you try to register a passkey and see an error that the passkey already exists, [delete the passkey](#delete-your-passkey-in-authenticator-for-ios) that was created locally in Authenticator and retry registration.

|AD DS Connector account|Used to read and write information to Windows Server AD by using Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS).|
|ADSync service account|Used to run the sync service and access the SQL Server database.|
|Microsoft Entra Connector account|Used to write information to Microsoft Entra ID.|
|Local Administrator account|The administrator who is installing Microsoft Entra Connect and who has local Administrator permissions on the computer.|
|AD DS Enterprise Administrator account|Optionally used to create the required AD DS Connector account.|
|Microsoft Entra Global Administrator account|Used to create the Microsoft Entra Connector account and to configure Microsoft Entra ID. You can view Global Administrator and Hybrid Identity Administrator accounts in the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com). See [List Microsoft Entra role assignments](~/identity/role-based-access-control/view-assignments.md).|
|SQL SA account (optional)|Used to create the ADSync database when you use the full version of SQL Server. The instance of SQL Server can be local or remote to the Microsoft Entra Connect installation. This account can be the same account as the Enterprise Administrator account.|

# Tutorial: Integrate a single forest with a single Microsoft Entra tenant

This tutorial walks you through creating a hybrid identity environment using Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync.

You can use the environment you create in this tutorial for testing or for getting more familiar with cloud sync.

## Prerequisites

<a name='in-the-entra-portal'></a>

### In the Microsoft Entra admin center

1. Create a cloud-only Global Administrator account on your Microsoft Entra tenant. This way, you can manage the configuration of your tenant should your on-premises services fail or become unavailable. Learn about [adding a cloud-only Global Administrator account](~/fundamentals/add-users.md). Completing this step is critical to ensure that you don't get locked out of your tenant.
2. Add one or more [custom domain names](~/fundamentals/add-custom-domain.yml) to your Microsoft Entra tenant. Your users can sign in with one of these domain names.

### In your on-premises environment

1. Identify a domain-joined host server running Windows Server 2016 or greater with minimum of 4-GB RAM and .NET 4.7.1+ runtime 

2. If there's a firewall between your servers and Microsoft Entra ID, configure the following items:
   - Ensure that agents can make *outbound* requests to Microsoft Entra ID over the following ports:

     | Port number | How it's used |
     | --- | --- |
     | **80** | Downloads the certificate revocation lists (CRLs) while validating the TLS/SSL certificate |
     | **443** | Handles all outbound communication with the service |
     | **8080** (optional) | Agents report their status every 10 minutes over port 8080, if port 443 is unavailable. This status is displayed on the portal. |
     
     If your firewall enforces rules according to the originating users, open these ports for traffic from Windows services that run as a network service.
   - If your firewall or proxy allows you to specify safe suffixes, then add  connections t to **\*.msappproxy.net** and **\*.servicebus.windows.net**. If not, allow access to the [Azure datacenter IP ranges](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=41653), which are updated weekly.
   - Your agents need access to **login.windows.net** and **login.microsoftonline.com** for initial registration. Open your firewall for those URLs as well.
   - For certificate validation, unblock the following URLs: **mscrl.microsoft.com:80**, **crl.microsoft.com:80**, **ocsp.msocsp.com:80**, and **www\.microsoft.com:80**. Since these URLs are used for certificate validation with other Microsoft products, you may already have these URLs unblocked.

## Install the Microsoft Entra Provisioning Agent

If you're using the  [Basic AD and Azure environment](tutorial-basic-ad-azure.md) tutorial, it would be DC1. To install the agent, follow these steps: 

[!INCLUDE [active-directory-cloud-sync-how-to-install](~/includes/entra-cloud-sync-how-to-install.md)]

## Verify agent installation

[!INCLUDE [active-directory-cloud-sync-how-to-verify-installation](~/includes/entra-cloud-sync-how-to-verify-installation.md)]

<a name='configure-azure-ad-connect-cloud-sync'></a>

## Configure Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync

[!INCLUDE [portal updates](~/includes/portal-update.md)]

Use the following steps to configure and start the provisioning:

[!INCLUDE [sign in](~/includes/cloud-sync-sign-in.md)]
 3. Select **New Configuration**
 4. On the configuration screen, enter a **Notification email**, move the selector to **Enable** and select **Save**.
 5. The configuration status should now be **Healthy**.

## Verify users are created and synchronization is occurring

You'll now verify that the users that you had in your on-premises directory that are in scope of synchronization have been synchronized and now exist in your Microsoft Entra tenant. The sync operation may take a few hours to complete. To verify users are synchronized, follow these steps:


 1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Hybrid Identity Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#hybrid-identity-administrator).
 2. Browse to **Identity** > **Users**.
 3. Verify that you see the new users in our tenant

## Test signing in with one of your users

 1. Browse to [https://myapps.microsoft.com](https://myapps.microsoft.com)

 2. Sign in with a user account that was created in your tenant.  You'll need to sign in using the following format: (user@domain.onmicrosoft.com). Use the same password that the user uses to sign in on-premises.

You've now successfully configured a hybrid identity environment using Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync.

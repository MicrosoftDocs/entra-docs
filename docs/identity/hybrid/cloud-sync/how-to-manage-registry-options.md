# Manage agent registry options

This section describes registry options that you can set to control the runtime processing behavior of the Microsoft Entra provisioning agent. 

## Configure LDAP connection timeout
When performing LDAP operations on configured Active Directory domain controllers, by default, the provisioning agent uses the default connection timeout value of 30 seconds. If your domain controller takes more time to respond, then you may see the following error message in the agent log file: 

`
System.DirectoryServices.Protocols.LdapException: The operation was aborted because the client side timeout limit was exceeded.
`

LDAP search operations can take longer if the search attribute is not indexed. As a first step, if you get the above error, first check if the search/lookup attribute is [indexed](/windows/win32/ad/indexed-attributes). If the search attributes are indexed and the error persists, you can increase the LDAP connection timeout using the following steps: 

1. Log on as Administrator on the Windows server running the Microsoft Entra provisioning agent.
1. Use the *Run* menu item to open the registry editor (regedit.exe) 
1. Locate the key folder **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Azure AD Connect Agents\Azure AD Connect Provisioning Agent**
1. Right-click and select "New -> String Value"
1. Provide the name: 
  `LdapConnectionTimeoutInMilliseconds`
1. Double-click on the **Value Name** and enter the value data as `60000` milliseconds.

1. Restart the Microsoft Entra Connect Provisioning Service from the *Services* console.
1. If you have deployed multiple provisioning agents, apply this registry change to all agents for consistency. 

## Configure referral chasing
By default, the Microsoft Entra provisioning agent does not chase [referrals](/windows/win32/ad/referrals). 
You may want to enable referral chasing, to support certain HR inbound provisioning scenarios such as: 
* Checking uniqueness of UPN across multiple domains
* Resolving cross-domain manager references

Use the following steps to turn on referral chasing:

1. Log on as Administrator on the Windows server running the Microsoft Entra provisioning agent.
1. Use the *Run* menu item to open the registry editor (regedit.exe) 
1. Locate the key folder **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Azure AD Connect Agents\Azure AD Connect Provisioning Agent**
1. Right-click and select "New -> String Value"
1. Provide the name: 
  `ReferralChasingOptions`
1. Double-click on the **Value Name** and enter the value data as `96`. This value corresponds to the constant value for `ReferralChasingOptions.All` and specifies that both subtree and base-level referrals will be followed by the agent.

1. Restart the Microsoft Entra Connect Provisioning Service from the *Services* console.
1. If you have deployed multiple provisioning agents, apply this registry change to all agents for consistency.



> [!NOTE]
> You can confirm the registry options have been set by enabling [verbose logging](how-to-troubleshoot.md#log-files). The logs emitted during agent startup will display the config values picked from the registry.

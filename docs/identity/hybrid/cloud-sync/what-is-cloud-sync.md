# What is Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync?

> [!VIDEO https://www.youtube.com/embed/9T6lKEloq0Q]

Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync is a new offering from Microsoft designed to meet and accomplish your hybrid identity goals for synchronization of users, groups, and contacts to Microsoft Entra ID.  It accomplishes this by using the Microsoft Entra cloud provisioning agent instead of the Microsoft Entra Connect application.  However, it can be used alongside Microsoft Entra Connect Sync and it provides the following benefits:
    
- Support for synchronizing to a Microsoft Entra tenant from a multi-forest disconnected Active Directory forest environment: The common scenarios include merger & acquisition (where the acquired company's AD forests are isolated from the parent company's AD forests), and companies that have historically had multiple AD forests.
- Simplified installation with light-weight provisioning agents: The agents act as a bridge from AD to Microsoft Entra ID, with all the sync configuration managed in the cloud. 
- Multiple provisioning agents can be used to simplify high availability deployments, particularly critical for organizations relying upon password hash synchronization from AD to Microsoft Entra ID.
- Support for large groups with up to 50,000 members. It's recommended to use only the OU scoping filter when synchronizing large groups.

## How is Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync different from Microsoft Entra Connect Sync?
With Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync, provisioning from AD to Microsoft Entra ID is orchestrated in Microsoft Online Services. An organization only needs to deploy, in their on-premises or IaaS-hosted environment, a light-weight agent that acts as a bridge between Microsoft Entra ID and AD. The provisioning configuration is stored in Microsoft Entra ID and managed as part of the service.

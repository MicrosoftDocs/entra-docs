# Tutorial: Basic Active Directory environment

This tutorial walks you through creating a basic Active Directory environment. 

![Diagram that shows a basic Microsoft Entra environment.](~/includes/governance/media/tutorial-single-forest/diagram-2.png)

You can use the environment you create in the tutorial to test various aspects of hybrid identity scenarios and will be a prerequisite for some of the tutorials. If you already have an existing Active Directory environment you can use that as a substitute. This information is provided for individuals who may be starting from nothing.

## Prerequisites
The following are prerequisites required for completing this tutorial
- A computer with [Hyper-V](/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/hyper-v-technology-overview) installed. It's suggested to do this on either a [Windows 10](/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/about/supported-guest-os) or a [Windows Server 2016](/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/supported-windows-guest-operating-systems-for-hyper-v-on-windows) computer.
- An [external network adapter](/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/connect-to-network) to allow the virtual machine to communicate with the internet.
- An [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free)
- A copy of Windows Server 2016
- [Microsoft .NET framework 4.7.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net471)

> [!NOTE]
> This tutorial uses PowerShell scripts so that you can create the tutorial environment in the quickest amount of time. Each of the scripts uses variables that are declared at the beginning of the scripts. You can and should change the variables to reflect your environment.
>
>The scripts used create a general Active Directory environment prior to installing the Microsoft Entra Connect cloud provisioning agent. They are relevant for all of the tutorials.
>
> Copies of the PowerShell scripts that are used in this tutorial are available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/billmath/tutorial-phs).

## Create a virtual machine
The first thing that you need to do, in order to get our hybrid identity environment up and running is to create a virtual machine that will be used as our on-premises Active Directory server. Do the following:

1. Open up the PowerShell ISE as Administrator.
2. Run the following script.

  ```powershell
  #Declare variables
  $VMName = 'DC1'
  $Switch = 'External'
  $InstallMedia = 'D:\ISO\en_windows_server_2016_updated_feb_2018_x64_dvd_11636692.iso'
  $Path = 'D:\VM'
  $VHDPath = 'D:\VM\DC1\DC1.vhdx'
  $VHDSize = '64424509440'

  #Create New Virtual Machine
  New-VM -Name $VMName -MemoryStartupBytes 16GB -BootDevice VHD -Path $Path -NewVHDPath $VHDPath -NewVHDSizeBytes $VHDSize -Generation 2 -Switch $Switch 

  #Set the memory to be non-dynamic
  Set-VMMemory $VMName -DynamicMemoryEnabled $false

  #Add DVD Drive to Virtual Machine
  Add-VMDvdDrive -VMName $VMName -ControllerNumber 0 -ControllerLocation 1 -Path $InstallMedia

  #Mount Installation Media
  $DVDDrive = Get-VMDvdDrive -VMName $VMName

  #Configure Virtual Machine to Boot from DVD
  Set-VMFirmware -VMName $VMName -FirstBootDevice $DVDDrive 
  ```

## Complete the operating system deployment
In order to finish building the virtual machine, you need to finish the operating system installation.

1. Hyper-V Manager, double-click on the virtual machine
2. Click on the Start button.
3. You'll be prompted to ‘Press any key to boot from CD or DVD’. Go ahead and do so.
4. On the Windows Server start up screen select your language and click **Next**.
5. Click **Install Now**.
6. Enter your license key and click **Next**.
7. Check **I accept the license terms and click **Next**.
8. Select **Custom: Install Windows Only (Advanced)**
9. Click **Next**
10. Once the installation has completed, restart the virtual machine, sign-in, and run Windows updates to ensure the VM is the most up-to-date. Install the latest updates.

## Install Active Directory prerequisites
Now that you have a virtual machine up, you need to do a few things prior to installing Active Directory. That is, you need to rename the virtual machine, set a static IP address and DNS information, and install the Remote Server Administration tools.  Do the following:

1. Open up the PowerShell ISE as Administrator.
2. Run the following script.

  ```powershell
  #Declare variables
  $ipaddress = "10.0.1.117" 
  $ipprefix = "24" 
  $ipgw = "10.0.1.1" 
  $ipdns = "10.0.1.117"
  $ipdns2 = "8.8.8.8" 
  $ipif = (Get-NetAdapter).ifIndex 
  $featureLogPath = "c:\poshlog\featurelog.txt" 
  $newname = "DC1"
  $addsTools = "RSAT-AD-Tools" 

  #Set static IP address
  New-NetIPAddress -IPAddress $ipaddress -PrefixLength $ipprefix -InterfaceIndex $ipif -DefaultGateway $ipgw 

  # Set the DNS servers
  Set-DnsClientServerAddress -InterfaceIndex $ipif -ServerAddresses ($ipdns, $ipdns2)

  #Rename the computer 
  Rename-Computer -NewName $newname -force 

  #Install features 
  New-Item $featureLogPath -ItemType file -Force 
  Add-WindowsFeature $addsTools 
  Get-WindowsFeature | Where installed >>$featureLogPath 

  #Restart the computer 
  Restart-Computer
  ```

## Create a Windows Server AD environment
Now that you have the VM created and it has been renamed and has a static IP address, you can go ahead and install and configure Active Directory Domain Services. Do the following:

1. Open up the PowerShell ISE as Administrator.
2. Run the following script.

  ```powershell
  #Declare variables
  $DatabasePath = "c:\windows\NTDS"
  $DomainMode = "WinThreshold"
  $DomainName = "contoso.com"
  $DomaninNetBIOSName = "CONTOSO"
  $ForestMode = "WinThreshold"
  $LogPath = "c:\windows\NTDS"
  $SysVolPath = "c:\windows\SYSVOL"
  $featureLogPath = "c:\poshlog\featurelog.txt" 
  $Password = "Pass1w0rd"
  $SecureString = ConvertTo-SecureString $Password -AsPlainText -Force

  #Install AD DS, DNS and GPMC 
  start-job -Name addFeature -ScriptBlock { 
  Add-WindowsFeature -Name "ad-domain-services" -IncludeAllSubFeature -IncludeManagementTools 
  Add-WindowsFeature -Name "dns" -IncludeAllSubFeature -IncludeManagementTools 
  Add-WindowsFeature -Name "gpmc" -IncludeAllSubFeature -IncludeManagementTools } 
  Wait-Job -Name addFeature 
  Get-WindowsFeature | Where installed >>$featureLogPath

  #Create New AD Forest
  Install-ADDSForest -CreateDnsDelegation:$false -DatabasePath $DatabasePath -DomainMode $DomainMode -DomainName $DomainName -SafeModeAdministratorPassword $SecureString -DomainNetbiosName $DomainNetBIOSName -ForestMode $ForestMode -InstallDns:$true -LogPath $LogPath -NoRebootOnCompletion:$false -SysvolPath $SysVolPath -Force:$true
  ```

## Create a Windows Server AD user
Now that you have our Active Directory environment, you need to a test account. This account will be created in our on-premises AD environment and then synchronized to Microsoft Entra ID. Do the following:

1. Open up the PowerShell ISE as Administrator.
2. Run the following script.

  ```powershell
  # Filename:  4_CreateUser.ps1
  # Description: Creates a user in Active Directory. This is part of
  #       the Azure AD Connect password hash sync tutorial.

  #
  #
  #
  #
  #Declare variables
  $Givenname = "Allie"
  $Surname = "McCray"
  $Displayname = "Allie McCray"
  $Name = "amccray"
  $Password = "Pass1w0rd"
  $Identity = "CN=ammccray,CN=Users,DC=contoso,DC=com"
  $SecureString = ConvertTo-SecureString $Password -AsPlainText -Force


  #Create the user
  New-ADUser -Name $Name -GivenName $Givenname -Surname $Surname -DisplayName $Displayname -AccountPassword $SecureString

  #Set the password to never expire
  Set-ADUser -Identity $Identity -PasswordNeverExpires $true -ChangePasswordAtLogon $false -Enabled $true
  ```

## Create a Microsoft Entra tenant

[!INCLUDE [portal updates](~/includes/portal-update.md)]

Now you need to create a Microsoft Entra tenant so that you can synchronize our users to the cloud. To create a new Microsoft Entra tenant, do the following.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) and sign in with an account that has your Microsoft Entra subscription.
2. Click **Overview**.
3. Click **Manage tenants**.
4. Select **Create**.</br>
5. Provide a **name for the organization** along with the **initial domain name**. Then select **Create**. This will create your directory.
6. Once this has completed, click the **here** link, to manage the directory.



## Create a Hybrid Identity Administrator in Microsoft Entra ID
Now that you have a Microsoft Entra tenant, you'll create a Hybrid Identity Administrator account. To create the Hybrid Identity Administrator account do the following.

1. Under **Manage**, select **Users**.</br>
![Screenshot that shows the "Overview" menu with "Users" selected.](~/includes/governance/media/tutorial-single-forest/administrator-1.png)</br>
2. Select **All users** and then select **+ New user**.
3. Provide a name and username for this user. This will be your Hybrid Identity Administrator for the tenant. You'll also want to change the **Directory role** to **Hybrid Identity Administrator.** You can also show the temporary password. When you're done, select **Create**.</br>
4. Once this has completed, open a new web browser and sign-in to myapps.microsoft.com using the new Hybrid Identity Administrator account and the temporary password.
5. Change the password for the Hybrid Identity Administrator to something that you'll remember.

## Optional: Another server and forest
The following is an optional section that provides steps to creating another server and or forest. This can be used in some of the more advanced tutorials such as [Pilot for Microsoft Entra Connect to cloud sync](tutorial-pilot-aadc-aadccp.md).

If you only need another server, you can stop after the - **Create the virtual machine** step and join the server to the existing domain that was created above. 

### Create a virtual machine

1. Open up the PowerShell ISE as Administrator.
2. Run the following script.

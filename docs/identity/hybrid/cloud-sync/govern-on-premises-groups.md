# Govern on-premises Active Directory Domain Services based apps (Kerberos) using Microsoft Entra ID Governance

[!INCLUDE [deprecation](~/includes/gwb-v2-deprecation.md)]

This article outlines the scenarios to use Microsoft Entra ID Governance for on-premises applications that are integrated with Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS).

**Scenario(s) covered:** Manage on-premises applications with Active
Directory groups that are provisioned from and managed in the cloud.
Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync allows you to fully govern application
assignments in AD DS while taking advantage of Microsoft Entra ID
Governance features to control and remediate any access related
requests.

For more information about how to govern applications that aren't integrated with AD DS, see [Govern access for applications in your environment](/entra/id-governance/identity-governance-applications-prepare).

## Supported scenarios

If you want to control whether a user can connect to an Active
Directory application that uses Windows authentication, you can use the
application proxy and a Microsoft Entra security group. If an
application checks a user's AD DS group memberships by using Kerberos or Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP),
then you can use Cloud Sync group provisioning to ensure the user has
those group memberships before they access the application.

The following sections discuss three options that are supported with
Cloud Sync group provisioning. The scenario options are meant to ensure
users assigned to the application have group memberships when they
authenticate to the application.

- Convert the Source of Authority (SOA) of groups in AD DS that are synchronized to Microsoft Entra ID by using Microsoft Entra Connect Sync or Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync.

- Create a new group and update the application, if it already exists,
  to check for the new group

- Create a new group and update the existing groups, the application was
  checked for, to include the new group as a member

Before you begin, ensure that you're a domain administrator in the
domain where the application is installed. Ensure you can sign into a
domain controller, or have the [Remote Server Administration tools](/troubleshoot/windows-server/system-management-components/remote-server-administration-tools) for AD DS administration installed on your Windows PC.

Microsoft Entra ID has an application proxy service that enables users
to access on-premises applications by signing in with their Microsoft
Entra account. For more information about how to configure app proxy, see [Add an on-premises application for remote access through application proxy in Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/identity/app-proxy/application-proxy-add-on-premises-application).

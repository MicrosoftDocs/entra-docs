# Govern on-premises Active Directory based apps (Kerberos) using Microsoft Entra ID Governance

[!INCLUDE [deprecation](~/includes/gwb-v2-deprecation.md)]

**Scenario:** Manage on-premises applications with Active Directory groups that are provisioned from and managed in the cloud. Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync allows you to fully govern application assignments in AD while taking advantage of Microsoft Entra ID Governance features to control and remediate any access related requests.

With the release of provisioning agent [1.1.1370.0](reference-version-history.md#1113700), cloud sync now has the ability to provision groups directly to your on-premises Active Directory environment. You can use identity governance features to govern access to AD-based applications, such as by including a [group in an entitlement management access package](../../../id-governance/entitlement-management-group-writeback.md).

# Accidental delete prevention

The following document describes the accidental deletion feature for Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync. The accidental delete feature is designed to protect you from accidental configuration changes and changes to your on-premises directory that would affect many users and groups. This feature allows you to:

- Configure the ability to prevent accidental deletes automatically. 
- Set the # of objects (threshold) beyond which the configuration takes effect.
- Set up a notification email address so they can get an email notification once the sync job in question is put in quarantine for this scenario.

>[!NOTE]
>If you have specified accidental delete prevention four group provisioning to Microsoft Entra ID, be aware this only prevents the group from being deleted. This does not prevent members from being deleted. To prevent members from being deleted, you should configure accidental delete prevention on synchronized users.

To use this feature, you set the threshold for the number of objects that, if deleted, synchronization should stop. So if this number is reached, the synchronization stops and a notification is sent to the email that is specified. This notification allows you to investigate what is going on.

For more information and an example, see the following video.

 3. Under **Configuration**, select your configuration.

## Recovering from an accidental delete instance
If you encounter an accidental delete you see this message on the status of your provisioning agent configuration. It says **Delete threshold exceeded**.

### Rejecting deletions

If you don't want to allow the deletions, you need to do the following actions:
- Investigate the source of the deletions.
- Fix the issue (example, OU was moved out of scope accidentally and you've now readded it back to the scope).
- Run **Restart sync** on the agent configuration.

# Device Authentication for Users Converted Using Source of Authority (SOA) 

Device authentication is a critical component for organizations managing hybrid and cloud environments. This article provides an overview of supported authentication methods for users in Microsoft Entra joined and hybrid joined devices who have converted their Source of Authority (SOA). It outlines the compatibility of password-based and passwordless sign-in methods, such as Windows Hello for Business and FIDO2 keys, across various trust configurations. If you have requirements to access on-premises resources tied to Active Directory, we recommend that you switch to cloud authentication first (PTA, PHS, native cloud authentication like certificates, passkeys, or password hashes) or go passwordless.

# Authenticate to Microsoft Entra ID by using application identity

Microsoft Entra Connect uses the [Microsoft Entra Connector account](reference-connect-accounts-permissions.md#accounts-used-for-microsoft-entra-connect) to authenticate and sync identities from Active Directory to Microsoft Entra Connect. This account uses a username and password to authenticate requests.

To enhance the security of the service, we're rolling out an application identity that uses Oauth 2.0 client credential flow with certificate credentials. In this new method, Microsoft Entra or an administrator creates a single tenant non-Microsoft application in Microsoft Entra ID and uses one of the following relevant certificate management options for the credentials.

Microsoft Entra Connect provides three options for application and certificate management:

- [Managed by Microsoft Entra Connect (default)](#managed-by-microsoft-entra-connect-default)
- [Bring Your Own Application (BYOA)](#bring-your-own-application)
- [Bring Your Own Certificate (BYOC)](#bring-your-own-certificate)

> [!NOTE]
> The [Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#application-administrator) role grants the ability to consent for application permissions, with the exception of application permissions for Azure AD Graph and Microsoft Graph. This means that the application administrator can still consent to application permissions for other apps, notably the AWS first-party app and SSPR first-party app.
>
> This role also grants the ability to manage application credentials. User assigned to this role can add credentials to an application (notably the Connect Sync) and use those credentials to impersonate the application's identity. This might be an elevation of privilege over what the user can do via their role assignments.

## Managed by Microsoft Entra Connect (default)

Microsoft Entra Connect manages the application and certificate, which includes creation, rotation, and deletion of the certificate. The certificate is stored in the `CURRENT_USER` store. For optimal protection of the certificate's private key, we recommend that the machine should use a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) solution to establish a hardware-based security boundary.

When a TPM is available, key service operations are performed within a dedicated hardware environment. In contrast, if a TPM can't be used, Microsoft Entra Connect defaults to storing the certificate in the default Microsoft Software Key Storage Provider and marks the private key as nonexportable for extra protection. Without the hardware isolation provided by a TPM, only software safeguards secure the private key, which doesn't achieve the same level of protection.

For more information on TPM technology, see [Trusted Platform Module technology overview](/windows/security/hardware-security/tpm/trusted-platform-module-overview).

We recommend the Microsoft Entra Connect certificate management (default) option  because we manage the keys and automatically rotate the certificate on expiry.

Microsoft Entra Connect Sync uses the scheduler to check if the certificate is due for rotation and then automatically rotate the certificate. If the scheduler is suspended, automatic certificate rotation can't happen even though Microsoft Entra Connect Sync manages the certificate.

## Bring Your Own Application

In the Bring Your Own Application (BYOA) setup, administrator manages the application that Microsoft Entra Connect Sync uses to authenticate to Microsoft Entra ID, the application permissions, and the certificate credential that the application uses.

The administrator [registers a Microsoft Entra app and creates a service principal](/graph/tutorial-applications-basics). The application needs the required permissions configured. To configure the required permissions on the application, you can use Microsoft Graph API or PowerShell. In this section, we'll use Microsoft Graph API.

 - `ConnectSyncAppId` refers to the application (client) ID of the application for which we want to configure permissions.
 - `SynchronizationServiceAppId` refers to the application (client) ID for **Microsoft Entra AD Synchronization Service**. The value is `6bf85cfa-ac8a-4be5-b5de-425a0d0dc016` for all clouds.
 - `PasswordResetServiceAppId` refers to the application (client) ID for **Microsoft password reset service**. The value is `93625bc8-bfe2-437a-97e0-3d0060024faa` for all clouds except Arlington where it's `2e5ecfc8-ea79-48bd-8140-c19324acb278`.

1. Open Graph explorer and sign in using Application Administrator or Global Administrator credentials.

1. Get the service principal ID for Microsoft Entra AD Synchronization Service. We'll refer to this as `SynchronizationServiceSPId`

   ```http
   GET /servicePrincipals/(appId=’{SynchronizationServiceAppId}’)?$select=id
   ```

1. Get the app role ID for `ADSynchronization.ReadWrite.All permission`. We'll refer to this as `SynchronizationServiceAppRoleId`

   ```http
   GET /servicePrincipals/(appId=’{SynchronizationServiceAppId}’)?$select=appRoles
   ```

   `SynchronizationServiceAppRoleId` is the id property of the app role in the response where value=`ADSynchronization.ReadWrite.All`

1. Get the service principal ID for Microsoft password reset service. We'll refer to this as `PasswordResetServiceSPId`. Note that the service principal might not exist in the tenant.

   ```http
   GET /servicePrincipals/(appId=’{PasswordResetServiceAppId}’)?$select=id
   ```

1. Get the app role IDs for `PasswordWriteback.OffboardClient.All`, `PasswordWriteback.RegisterClientVersion.All` and `PasswordWriteback.RefreshClient.All` permissions. This step is relevant only if password reset service principal exists in the tenant. We'll refer to these as `PasswordResetServiceServiceOffboardClientAppRoleId`, `PasswordResetServiceServiceRegisterClientAppRoleId`, `PasswordResetServiceServiceRefreshClientAppRoleId` respectively.

   - `PasswordResetServiceServiceOffboardClientAppRoleId` is the id of the app role in the response where value=`PasswordWriteback.OffboardClient.All`
   - `PasswordResetServiceServiceRegisterClientAppRoleId` is the id of the app role in the response where value=`PasswordWriteback.RegisterClientVersion.All`
   - `PasswordResetServiceServiceRefreshClientAppRoleId` is the id of the app role in the response where value=`PasswordWriteback.RefreshClient.All`

1. Update application `requiredResourceAccess` to configure required permissions for Microsoft Entra AD Synchronization Service and Microsoft password reset service.

     ```http 
          PATCH /applications(appId='{ConnectSyncAppId}')
          {
               "requiredResourceAccess": [
                    {
                         "resourceAppId": "{PasswordResetServiceAppId}",
                         "resourceAccess": [
                              {
                                   "id": “{PasswordResetServiceServiceOffboardClientAppRoleId}",
                                   "type": "Role"
                              },
                              {
                                   "id": “{PasswordResetServiceServiceRegisterClientAppRoleId}",
                                   "type": "Role"
                              },
                              {
                                   "id": “{PasswordResetServiceServiceRefreshClientAppRoleId}",
                                   "type": "Role"
                              }
                         ]
                    },
                    {
                         "resourceAppId": "{SynchronizationServiceAppId}",
                         "resourceAccess": [
                              {
                                   "id": "{SynchronizationServiceAppRoleId}",
                                   "type": "Role"
                              }
                         ]
                    }
               ]
          }
     ```

1. Assign app roles to the Connect Sync application service principal:

   1. Add an app role assignment for `ADSynchronization.ReadWrite.All`
     
      ```http
      POST /servicePrincipals(appId='{ConnectSyncAppId}')/appRoleAssignments
      {
      "principalId": “{ConnectSyncSPId}”,
      "resourceId": “{SynchronizationServiceSPId}”,
      "appRoleId": "{SynchronizationServiceAppRoleId}"
      }
      ```

 1. If password writeback is enabled on the Connect Sync server, add the three app role assignments for password reset service.

    1. Add app role assignment for `PasswordWriteback.OffboardClient.All`

       ```http   
       POST /servicePrincipals(appId='{ConnectSyncAppId}')/appRoleAssignments
       {
       "principalId": “{ConnectSyncSPId}”,
       "resourceId": “{PasswordResetServiceSPId}”,
       "appRoleId": "{PasswordResetServiceServiceOffboardClientAppRoleId}"
       }
       ```

   1. Add app role assignment for `PasswordWriteback.RegisterClientVersion.All`

      ```http
      POST /servicePrincipals(appId='{ConnectSyncAppId}')/appRoleAssignments
      {
      "principalId": “{ConnectSyncSPId}”,
      "resourceId": “{PasswordResetServiceSPId}”,
      "appRoleId": "{PasswordResetServiceServiceRegisterClientAppRoleId}"
      }
      ```
     
   1. Add app role assignment for value=`PasswordWriteback.RefreshClient.All`

      ```http
      POST /servicePrincipals(appId='{ConnectSyncAppId}')/appRoleAssignments
      {
      "principalId": “{ConnectSyncSPId}”,
      "resourceId": “{PasswordResetServiceSPId}”,
      "appRoleId": “{PasswordResetServiceServiceRefreshClientAppRoleId}”
      }
      ```

The administrator is responsible for creating the certificate, rotation, and deletion of unused or expired certificates. The certificate must be stored in the `LOCAL_MACHINE` store.

The administrator is responsible for securing the private key of the certificate and ensuring that only Microsoft Entra Connect Sync can access the private key for signing.

We recommend that you use a TPM or a Hardware Security Module (HSM) to provide a hardware-based security boundary, as opposed to the default. To check the status of the TPM, use the [Get-TPM](/powershell/module/trustedplatformmodule/get-tpm) PowerShell cmdlet.

If you use Hyper-V virtual machines (VMs), you can enable the TPM by selecting **Security** > **Enable Trusted Platform Module**. You can do this step only on generation 2 VMs. Generation 1 VMs can't be converted to generation 2 VMs. For more information, see [Generation 2 VM security settings for Hyper-V](/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/learn-more/generation-2-virtual-machine-security-settings-for-hyper-v) and [Enable trusted launch on existing Azure Gen2 VMs](/azure/virtual-machines/trusted-launch-existing-vm).


## Bring Your Own Certificate

In the Bring Your Own Certificate (BYOC) setup, the administrator manages the certificate credential that the application uses. The administrator is responsible for creating the certificate, rotation, and deletion of unused or expired certificates. The certificate must be stored in the `LOCAL_MACHINE` store.

The administrator is responsible for securing the private key of the certificate and ensuring that only Microsoft Entra Connect Sync can access the private key for signing.

We recommend that you use a TPM or a Hardware Security Module (HSM) to provide a hardware-based security boundary, as opposed to the default. To check the status of the TPM, use the [Get-TPM](/powershell/module/trustedplatformmodule/get-tpm) PowerShell cmdlet.

You can do this step only on generation 2 VMs. Generation 1 VMs can't be converted to generation 2 VMs. For more information, see [Generation 2 VM security settings for Hyper-V](/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/learn-more/generation-2-virtual-machine-security-settings-for-hyper-v) and [Enable trusted launch on existing Azure Gen2 VMs](/azure/virtual-machines/trusted-launch-existing-vm).

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are required to implement authentication by using application identity.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> New Microsoft Entra Connect Sync versions are available only via the Microsoft Entra admin center.
>
> Following up on the [What's New](../../../fundamentals/whats-new.md#general-availability---download-microsoft-entra-connect-sync-on-the-microsoft-entra-admin-center) communication, new versions of Microsoft Entra Connect Sync are available only on the [Microsoft Entra Connect pane](https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_Connect_Provisioning/AADConnectMenuBlade/%7E/GetStarted) within the Microsoft Entra admin center and will no longer be released to the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=47594).

- [Microsoft Entra Connect](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=47594) version [2.5.3.0](reference-connect-version-history.md#2530) or greater for manual onboarding.
- Microsoft Entra Connect version [2.5.76.0](reference-connect-version-history.md#25760) or greater for automatic onboarding
- Microsoft Entra account with at least a [Hybrid Identity Administrator](../../role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#hybrid-identity-administrator) role.
- Optional: TPM 2.0 present and ready to use (highly recommended for security).

The following extra requirements are needed for the BYOC certificate management option:

- A certificate is created in an HSM or TPM by using a Cryptography API: Next Generation provider. The private key is marked as nonexportable. A warning event 1014 is emitted if TPM isn't used. The following certificate configurations are supported:
   - `KeyLength`: 2048
   - `KeyAlgorithm`: RSA
   - `KeyHashAlgorithm`: SHA256
- The created certificate is stored in the `LOCAL_MACHINE` store.
- Grant the Microsoft Entra Connect Sync account permission to perform signing by using the private key.

The following extra requirements are needed for the BYOA application management option:

- The customer creates a certificate as instructed in the preceding BYOC prerequisites.
- The customer registers an application in Microsoft Entra ID and creates a service principal. The necessary permissions are granted to the application.
- The customer registers the certificate with the application.

## View the current authentication configuration

## Installation and upgrade (managed by Microsoft Entra Connect)

The Microsoft Entra Connect Sync managed application and credential is automatically set up during initial installation or manual interactive upgrades. To confirm that Microsoft Entra Connect is using the application identity, you can view the [current authentication configuration](#view-the-current-authentication-configuration).

## Onboard to application-based authentication

### Automatic

Starting with version 2.5.76.0 or higher, the service will automatically configure application authentication within a six-hour window if the service is using username and password to authenticate to Microsoft Entra ID.

### Manual

If application authentication wasn't automatically configured, you can switch to application-based authentication manually.

If you want to configure application-based authentication using the default option (Managed by Microsoft Entra Connect), you can use the wizard. However, if you want to configure application-based authentication using BYOC or BYOA, you must use PowerShell.

# [Default](#tab/default)

1.	Start the Microsoft Entra Connect wizard
2.	Go to **Additional tasks** > **Configure application-based authentication to Microsoft Entra ID** and then follow the prompts.

## Certificate rotation

Microsoft Entra Connect warns if the certificate rotation is due. That is, if expiration is less than or equal to 150 days. It emits an error if the certificate is already expired. You can find these warnings (Event ID 1011) and errors (Event ID 1012) in the Application event log.

This message is emitted at the scheduler frequency if the scheduler isn't suspended. Run `Get-ADSyncSchedulerSettings` to see if the scheduler is suspended.

### Automatic

If Microsoft Entra Connect manages the certificate, *no action* is required from you unless the scheduler is suspended, Microsoft Entra Connect Sync adds the new certificate credential to the application, and tries to remove the old certificate credential. 

If it fails to remove the old certificate credential, an error event appears in the Application logs in the Event Viewer.

If you see this error, run the following cmdlet in PowerShell to clean up the old certificate credential from Microsoft Entra. The cmdlet takes the `CertificateId` value of the certificate that must be removed, which you can obtain from the log or the Microsoft Entra admin center.

 ``` powershell
Remove-EntraApplicationKey -CertificateId <certificateId>
 ```

### Manual

If your configuration isn't eligible for automatic certificate rotation, you can rotate the certificate at any point in time, even if the current certificate is still not due for rotation or the current certificate expired.

# [Default](#tab/default)

1. Start the Microsoft Entra Connect wizard
1. Go to **Additional tasks** > **Rotate application certificate** and then follow the prompts.


 :::image type="content" source="media/authenticate-application-id/auth-6.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Rotate application certificate option on the Additional tasks pane." lightbox="media/authenticate-application-id/auth-6.png":::

# [BYOC](#tab/byoc)

When you get a warning from Microsoft Entra Connect Sync, we *highly recommend that you generate a new key and certificate and rotate the certificate* that Microsoft Entra Connect Sync uses.

1. Disable the scheduler to ensure that no sync cycles run until this change is completed.

     ``` powershell
     Set-ADSyncScheduler -SyncCycleEnabled $false
     ```

1. Invoke certificate credential rotation

   > [!NOTE]
   > The `certificate SHA256Hash` must be provided when you rotate the certificate. Use the [generation script](#script-to-generate-the-sha256-hash-of-the-certificate) to generate the hash.
  
     ``` powershell
     Invoke-ADSyncApplicationCredentialRotation -CertificateSHA256Hash <CertificateSHA256Hash>
     ```    
    Replace `<CertificateSHA256Hash>` with the `CertificateSHA256Hash`.
    
1. Reenable the scheduler to begin the synchronization service:
    
     ``` powershell
     Set-ADSyncScheduler -SyncCycleEnabled $true
     ```

1. Verify that the sync cycle is successful.
1. Remove the old certificate from the `LOCAL_MACHINE` store.

# [BYOA](#tab/byoa)

When you get a warning from Microsoft Entra Connect Sync, we *highly recommend that you generate a new key and certificate and rotate the certificate* that Microsoft Entra Connect Sync uses.

1. Disable the scheduler to ensure that no sync cycles run until this change is completed. Use the following PowerShell cmdlet to disable the scheduler:

     ``` powershell
     Set-ADSyncScheduler -SyncCycleEnabled $false
     ```

1. Invoke certificate credential rotation

   > [!NOTE]
   > The `certificate SHA256Hash` must be provided when you rotate the certificate. Use the [generation script](#script-to-generate-the-sha256-hash-of-the-certificate) to generate the hash.
   
     ``` powershell
     Invoke-ADSyncApplicationCredentialRotation -CertificateSHA256Hash <CertificateSHA256Hash>
     ```
    
        
    Replace `<CertificateSHA256Hash>` with the `CertificateSHA256Hash`.    
1. Reenable the scheduler to begin the synchronization service:
    
     ``` powershell
     Set-ADSyncScheduler -SyncCycleEnabled $true
     ```

1. Verify that the sync cycle is successful.
1. Remove the old certificate from the `LOCAL_MACHINE` store.

---

## Script to generate the SHA256 hash of the certificate

``` powershell
# Get raw data from X509Certificate cert
$certRawDataString = $cert.GetRawCertData()

# Compute SHA256Hash of certificate 
$sha256 = [System.Security.Cryptography.SHA256]::Create()
$hashBytes = $sha256.ComputeHash($certRawDataString)

# Convert hash to bytes for PowerShell (Core) 7.1+:
$certHash = [System.Convert]::ToHexString($hashBytes)

# Convert hash to bytes for older PowerShell:
$certHash = ($hashBytes|ForEach-Object ToString X2) -join ''
```

## Certificate revocation process

For self-signed certificates, either Microsoft Entra Managed or BYOC, an administrator must perform manual revocation by removing the `keyCredential` value from Microsoft Entra ID. An on-demand rotation of the certificate is also an option.

For BYOC certificates issued by a Certificate Authority registered with Microsoft Entra, the administrator can follow the [certificate revocation process](../../authentication/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive.md#certificate-revocation-process).

## Remove a legacy service account

After you transition to application-based authentication and Microsoft Entra Connect Sync is working as expected, we strongly recommend that you remove the legacy DSA username and password service account by using PowerShell. If you use a custom account that can't be removed, deprivilege it and remove the DSA role from it.

Follow these steps to remove the legacy service account.

1. Add the service account username and password.

     ``` powershell 
     $HACredential
     ```

 1. You're prompted to enter the Microsoft Entra administrator `UserPrincipalName` value and the password. Enter the username and password.

 1. Next, remove the service account.

     ``` powershell
     Remove-ADSyncAADServiceAccount -AADCredential $HACredential -Name <$serviceAccountName>
     ```

    The `ServiceAccountName` value is the first part of the `UserPrincipalName` value of the service account used in Microsoft Entra ID. You can find this user in the list of users in the Microsoft Entra admin center. If the UPN is `aringdahl@fabrikam.com`, use `aringdahl` as the `ServiceAccountName` value.

## Roll back to a legacy service account by using PowerShell

If you want to go back to the legacy service account, you can use PowerShell to revert to using the service account to promptly mitigate the issue. Use the following steps to roll back to the service account.

As part of the rollback, we'll be re-creating the DSA account. This new account might take up to 15 minutes to take effect, so you might get an "Access Denied" error when you reenable the sync cycle.

1. Disable the scheduler to ensure that no sync cycles run until this change is completed.

     ``` powershell
     Set-ADSyncScheduler -SyncCycleEnabled $false
     ```

1. Add the service account. You're prompted to enter the Microsoft Entra administrator `UserPrincipalName` value and the password. Enter the credentials.

     ``` powershell
    Add-ADSyncAADServiceAccount
     ```

1. Get the current authentication mechanism and confirm that the `ConnectorIdentityType` value is back to `ServiceAccount`.

     ``` powershell
    Get-ADSyncEntraConnectorCredential
     ```

1. Reenable the scheduler to begin the synchronization service.

     ``` powershell
     Set-ADSyncScheduler -SyncCycleEnabled $true
     ```

# Authenticate to Microsoft Entra ID by using application identity

Microsoft Entra Connect uses the [Microsoft Entra Connector account](reference-connect-accounts-permissions.md#accounts-used-for-microsoft-entra-connect) to authenticate and sync identities from Active Directory to Microsoft Entra Connect. This account uses a username and password to authenticate requests.

To enhance the security of thGet-e service, we're rolling out an application identity that uses Oauth 2.0 client credential flow with certificate credentials. In this new method, Microsoft Entra or an administrator creates a single tenant non-Microsoft application in Microsoft Entra ID and uses one of the following relevant certificate management options for the credentials.

Microsoft Entra Connect provides three options for application and certificate management:

- [Managed by Microsoft Entra Connect (default)](#managed-by-microsoft-entra-connect-default)
- [Bring Your Own Certificate (BYOC)](#bring-your-own-certificate)
- [Bring Your Own Application (BYOA)](#bring-your-own-application)

> [!NOTE]
> The [Application Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#application-administrator) role grants the ability to consent for application permissions, with the exception of application permissions for Azure AD Graph and Microsoft Graph. This means that the application administrator can still consent to application permissions for other apps, notably the AWS first-party app and SSPR first-party app.
>
> This role also grants the ability to manage application credentials. User assigned to this role can add credentials to an application (notably the Connect Sync) and use those credentials to impersonate the application's identity. This might be an elevation of privilege over what the user can do via their role assignments.

## Managed by Microsoft Entra Connect (default)

Microsoft Entra Connect manages the application and certificate, which includes creation, rotation, and deletion of the certificate. The certificate is stored in the `CURRENT_USER` store. For optimal protection of the certificate's private key, we recommend that the machine should use a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) solution to establish a hardware-based security boundary.

When a TPM is available, key service operations are performed within a dedicated hardware environment. In contrast, if a TPM can't be used, Microsoft Entra Connect defaults to storing the certificate in the default Microsoft Software Key Storage Provider and marks the private key as nonexportable for extra protection. Without the hardware isolation provided by a TPM, only software safeguards secure the private key, which doesn't achieve the same level of protection.

For more information on TPM technology, see [Trusted Platform Module technology overview](/windows/security/hardware-security/tpm/trusted-platform-module-overview).

We recommend the Microsoft Entra Connect certificate management (default) option  because we manage the keys and automatically rotate the certificate on expiry.

Microsoft Entra Connect Sync uses the scheduler to check if the certificate is due for rotation and then automatically rotate the certificate. If the scheduler is suspended, automatic certificate rotation can't happen even though Microsoft Entra Connect Sync manages the certificate.

## Bring Your Own Certificate

In the Bring Your Own Certificate (BYOC) setup, the administrator manages the certificate credential that the application uses. The administrator is responsible for creating the certificate, rotation, and deletion of unused or expired certificates. The certificate must be stored in the `LOCAL_MACHINE` store.

The administrator is responsible for securing the private key of the certificate and ensuring that only Microsoft Entra Connect Sync can access the private key for signing.

We recommend that you use a TPM or a Hardware Security Module (HSM) to provide a hardware-based security boundary, as opposed to the default. To check the status of the TPM, use the [Get-TPM](/powershell/module/trustedplatformmodule/get-tpm) PowerShell cmdlet.

If you use Hyper-V virtual machines (VMs), you can enable the TPM by selecting **Security** > **Enable Trusted Platform Module**. You can do this step only on generation 2 VMs. Generation 1 VMs can't be converted to generation 2 VMs. For more information, see [Generation 2 VM security settings for Hyper-V](/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/learn-more/generation-2-virtual-machine-security-settings-for-hyper-v) and [Enable trusted launch on existing Azure Gen2 VMs](/azure/virtual-machines/trusted-launch-existing-vm).

## Bring Your Own Application

In the Bring Your Own Application (BYOA) setup, administrator manages the application that Microsoft Entra Connect Sync uses to authenticate to Microsoft Entra ID, the application permissions, and the certificate credential that the application uses.

The administrator [registers a Microsoft Entra app and creates a service principal](/graph/tutorial-applications-basics). The application needs the required permissions configured. To configure the required permissions on the application, you can use Microsoft Graph API or PowerShell. In this section, we'll use PowerShell MgGraph commands.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Entra Connect Sync version 2.5.76.0 or later is required to proceed with the following steps to authenticate to Microsoft Entra ID by using application identity.

> [!NOTE]
> Using Bring Your Own Application requires having Your Own Certificate.

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are required to implement authentication by using application identity.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> New Microsoft Entra Connect Sync versions are available only via the Microsoft Entra admin center.
>
> Following up on the [What's New](../../../fundamentals/whats-new-archive.md#general-availability---download-microsoft-entra-connect-sync-on-the-microsoft-entra-admin-center) communication, new versions of Microsoft Entra Connect Sync are available only on the [Microsoft Entra Connect pane](https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_Connect_Provisioning/AADConnectMenuBlade/%7E/GetStarted) within the Microsoft Entra admin center and will no longer be released to the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=47594).

- [Microsoft Entra Connect](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=47594) version [2.5.3.0](reference-connect-version-history.md#2530) or greater for manual onboarding.
- Microsoft Entra Connect version [2.5.76.0](reference-connect-version-history.md#25760) or greater for automatic onboarding
- Microsoft Entra account with at least a [Hybrid Identity Administrator](../../role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#hybrid-identity-administrator) role.
- Optional: TPM 2.0 present and ready to use (highly recommended for security).

The following extra requirements are needed for BYOA and BYOC certificate management option:

- A certificate is created in an HSM or TPM by using a Cryptography API: Next Generation provider. The private key is marked as NonExportable. A warning event 1014 is emitted if TPM isn't used. The following certificate configurations are supported:
   - `KeyUsage`: DigitalSignature
   - `KeyLength`: 2048
   - `KeyAlgorithm`: RSA
   - `KeyHashAlgorithm`: SHA256
- The created certificate is stored in the `LOCAL_MACHINE` store.
- Grant the Microsoft Entra Connect Sync account permission to perform signing by using the private key.

The following extra requirements are needed for the BYOA application management option:

- The customer creates a certificate as instructed in the preceding BYOC prerequisites.
- The customer registers an application in Microsoft Entra ID and creates a service principal. The necessary permissions are granted to the application.
- The customer registers the certificate with the application.

- `ConnectSyncAppId` refers to the application (client) ID of the application for which we want to configure permissions.
 - `SynchronizationServiceAppId` refers to the application (client) ID for **Microsoft Entra AD Synchronization Service**. The value is `6bf85cfa-ac8a-4be5-b5de-425a0d0dc016` for all clouds.
 - `PasswordResetServiceAppId` refers to the application (client) ID for **Microsoft password reset service**. The value is `93625bc8-bfe2-437a-97e0-3d0060024faa` for all clouds except Arlington where it's `2e5ecfc8-ea79-48bd-8140-c19324acb278`.

1. Open Graph explorer and sign in using Application Administrator or Global Administrator credentials.

1. Get the service principal ID for Microsoft Entra AD Synchronization Service. We'll refer to this as `SynchronizationServiceSPId`

   ```http
   GET /servicePrincipals/(appId=’{SynchronizationServiceAppId}’)?$select=id
   ```

1. Get the app role ID for `ADSynchronization.ReadWrite.All permission`. We'll refer to this as `SynchronizationServiceAppRoleId`

   ```http
   GET /servicePrincipals/(appId=’{SynchronizationServiceAppId}’)?$select=appRoles
   ```

   `SynchronizationServiceAppRoleId` is the id property of the app role in the response where value=`ADSynchronization.ReadWrite.All`

1. Get the service principal ID for Microsoft password reset service. We'll refer to this as `PasswordResetServiceSPId`. Note that the service principal might not exist in the tenant.

   ```http
   GET /servicePrincipals/(appId=’{PasswordResetServiceAppId}’)?$select=id
   ```

1. Get the app role IDs for `PasswordWriteback.OffboardClient.All`, `PasswordWriteback.RegisterClientVersion.All` and `PasswordWriteback.RefreshClient.All` permissions. This step is relevant only if password reset service principal exists in the tenant. We'll refer to these as `PasswordResetServiceServiceOffboardClientAppRoleId`, `PasswordResetServiceServiceRegisterClientAppRoleId`, `PasswordResetServiceServiceRefreshClientAppRoleId` respectively.

   - `PasswordResetServiceServiceOffboardClientAppRoleId` is the id of the app role in the response where value=`PasswordWriteback.OffboardClient.All`
   - `PasswordResetServiceServiceRegisterClientAppRoleId` is the id of the app role in the response where value=`PasswordWriteback.RegisterClientVersion.All`
   - `PasswordResetServiceServiceRefreshClientAppRoleId` is the id of the app role in the response where value=`PasswordWriteback.RefreshClient.All`

1. Update application `requiredResourceAccess` to configure required permissions for Microsoft Entra AD Synchronization Service and Microsoft password reset service.

     ```http 
          PATCH /applications(appId='{ConnectSyncAppId}')
          {
               "requiredResourceAccess": [
                    {
                         "resourceAppId": "{PasswordResetServiceAppId}",
                         "resourceAccess": [
                              {
                                   "id": “{PasswordResetServiceServiceOffboardClientAppRoleId}",
                                   "type": "Role"
                              },
                              {
                                   "id": “{PasswordResetServiceServiceRegisterClientAppRoleId}",
                                   "type": "Role"
                              },
                              {
                                   "id": “{PasswordResetServiceServiceRefreshClientAppRoleId}",
                                   "type": "Role"
                              }
                         ]
                    },
                    {
                         "resourceAppId": "{SynchronizationServiceAppId}",
                         "resourceAccess": [
                              {
                                   "id": "{SynchronizationServiceAppRoleId}",
                                   "type": "Role"
                              }
                         ]
                    }
               ]
          }
     ```

1. Assign app roles to the Connect Sync application service principal:

   1. Add an app role assignment for `ADSynchronization.ReadWrite.All`
     
      ```http
      POST /servicePrincipals(appId='{ConnectSyncAppId}')/appRoleAssignments
      {
      "principalId": “{ConnectSyncSPId}”,
      "resourceId": “{SynchronizationServiceSPId}”,
      "appRoleId": "{SynchronizationServiceAppRoleId}"
      }
      ```

 1. If password writeback is enabled on the Connect Sync server, add the three app role assignments for password reset service.

    1. Add app role assignment for `PasswordWriteback.OffboardClient.All`

       ```http   
       POST /servicePrincipals(appId='{ConnectSyncAppId}')/appRoleAssignments
       {
       "principalId": “{ConnectSyncSPId}”,
       "resourceId": “{PasswordResetServiceSPId}”,
       "appRoleId": "{PasswordResetServiceServiceOffboardClientAppRoleId}"
       }
       ```

   1. Add app role assignment for `PasswordWriteback.RegisterClientVersion.All`

      ```http
      POST /servicePrincipals(appId='{ConnectSyncAppId}')/appRoleAssignments
      {
      "principalId": “{ConnectSyncSPId}”,
      "resourceId": “{PasswordResetServiceSPId}”,
      "appRoleId": "{PasswordResetServiceServiceRegisterClientAppRoleId}"
      }
      ```
     
   1. Add app role assignment for value=`PasswordWriteback.RefreshClient.All`

      ```http
      POST /servicePrincipals(appId='{ConnectSyncAppId}')/appRoleAssignments
      {
      "principalId": “{ConnectSyncSPId}”,
      "resourceId": “{PasswordResetServiceSPId}”,
      "appRoleId": “{PasswordResetServiceServiceRefreshClientAppRoleId}”
      }
      ```

The administrator is responsible for creating the certificate, rotation, and deletion of unused or expired certificates. The certificate must be stored in the `LOCAL_MACHINE` store.

The administrator is responsible for securing the private key of the certificate and ensuring that only Microsoft Entra Connect Sync can access the private key for signing.

We recommend that you use a TPM or a Hardware Security Module (HSM) to provide a hardware-based security boundary, as opposed to the default. To check the status of the TPM, use the [Get-TPM](/powershell/module/trustedplatformmodule/get-tpm) PowerShell cmdlet.

If you use Hyper-V virtual machines (VMs), you can enable the TPM by selecting **Security** > **Enable Trusted Platform Module**. You can do this step only on generation 2 VMs. Generation 1 VMs can't be converted to generation 2 VMs. For more information, see [Generation 2 VM security settings for Hyper-V](/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/learn-more/generation-2-virtual-machine-security-settings-for-hyper-v) and [Enable trusted launch on existing Azure Gen2 VMs](/azure/virtual-machines/trusted-launch-existing-vm).





## Installation and upgrade (managed by Microsoft Entra Connect)

The Microsoft Entra Connect Sync managed application and credential is automatically set up during initial installation or manual interactive upgrades. To confirm that Microsoft Entra Connect is using the application identity, you can view the [current authentication configuration](#view-the-current-authentication-configuration).

## Onboard to application-based authentication

### Automatic

Starting with version 2.5.76.0 or higher, the service will automatically configure application authentication within a six-hour window if the service is using username and password to authenticate to Microsoft Entra ID.

### Manual

If application authentication wasn't automatically configured, you can switch to application-based authentication manually.

If you want to configure application-based authentication using the default option (Managed by Microsoft Entra Connect), you can use the wizard. However, if you want to configure application-based authentication using BYOC or BYOA, you must use PowerShell.

# [Default](#tab/default)

1.	Start the Microsoft Entra Connect wizard
2.	Go to **Additional tasks** > **Configure application-based authentication to Microsoft Entra ID** and then follow the prompts.

 :::image type="content" source="media/authenticate-application-id/auth-4.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows configuring application-based authentication on the Additional tasks pane." lightbox="media/authenticate-application-id/auth-4.png":::

# [BYOC with Default Application](#tab/BYOC)

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure that you're on the Microsoft Entra Connect server and that the Microsoft Entra Connect Sync (ADSync) PowerShell module is installed.

Use the wizard view the [current authentication configuration](#view-the-current-authentication-configuration) to confirm that Microsoft Entra Connect is using the application identity, or use PowerShell command to verify the current authentication method.

     ``` powershell
     Get-ADSyncEntraConnectorCredential
     ```

This command returns the `ConnectorIdentityType` value currently in use. The value can be `ServiceAccount` or `Application`. If the authentication is using `ServiceAccount` then proceed with following steps to switch from `ServiceAccount` to `Application`. If the authentication is using `Application`, then skip to "Change Application certificate to your own certificate" steps.

#### Switch from ServiceAccount to Application

1. Start the Microsoft Entra Connect wizard.
2.	Go to **Additional tasks** > **Configure application-based authentication to Microsoft Entra ID** and then follow the prompts.

 :::image type="content" source="media/authenticate-application-id/auth-4.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows configuring application-based authentication on the Additional tasks pane." lightbox="media/authenticate-application-id/auth-4.png":::

#### Change Application certificate to your own certificate

**Step 1:** Export the certificate (.cer) file to upload it Entra ID App registration using one of the following options:
**Option 1**: Using mmc console to export a certificate from the Windows certificate stores:
1.	Open the certificate management console for the local computer by running the following command. Some methods of running this command are from the Start menu, the Windows Run prompt, PowerShell prompt, or command prompt.

     ``` powershell
     certlm.msc
     ```
2.	In the console tree, navigate to the certificate you want to export.
3.	Right-click the certificate, select **All Tasks**, and then select **Export**.
4.	On the screen **Welcome to the Certificate Export Wizard**, select **Next**.
5.	If prompted to export the private key, select **No, do not export the private key**, then select **Next**.
6.	For the file format, select **DER encoded binary X.509 (.CER)**, then select **Next**.
7.	Enter or browse to the file path, then select **Next**.
8.	Review the summary, then select **Finish**.

**Option 2:** Use PowerShell to export the certificate:

``` powershell
$cerFile  = "C:\Temp\MyBYOC.cer"
$cert = Get-ChildItem Cert:\LocalMachine\My | Where-Object {$_.Subject -eq 'CN=YOUR_CERTIFICATE_SUBJECT'}  
Export-Certificate -Cert $cert -FilePath $cerFile
```

**Step 2:** In Entra Admin Center https://entra.microsoft.com/ navigate to **App Registration**, and select the application that was created during the installation, configuration or the upgrade of Connect Sync. To confirm which application used by Connect Sync you can run the `Get-ADSyncEntraConnectorCredential` command to retrieve the application (client) ID. The username format is `{AppID}@tenantName.onmicrosoft.com`. Under **Certificate & secrets** click on **Upload certificate** and upload the exported .cer file and click on **Add**:

 :::image type="content" source="media/authenticate-application-id/app-registration-cert.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows uploading certificate to App Registration." lightbox="media/authenticate-application-id/app-registration-cert.png":::

**Step 3:** Get the certificate Hash using following PowerShell commands

``` powershell
$cert = Get-ChildItem Cert:\LocalMachine\My | Where-Object {$_.Subject -eq 'CN=YOUR_CERTIFICATE_SUBJECT'}  

# Get raw data from X509Certificate cert
$certRawDataString = $cert.GetRawCertData()
 
# Compute SHA256Hash of certificate 
$sha256 = [System.Security.Cryptography.SHA256]::Create()
$hashBytes = $sha256.ComputeHash($certRawDataString)
```

If you are using **PowerShell version 7**, use following command:

``` powershell
$certHash = [System.Convert]::ToHexString($hashBytes)
```

If you are using **older PowerShell versions** or **PowerShell ISE**, use following command:

``` powershell
$certHash = ($hashBytes|ForEach-Object ToString X2) -join ''
```
**Step 4:** Grant Connect Sync (ADSync) service account permissions to retrieve the certificate private key:
``` powershell
$rsaCert = [System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.RSACertificateExtensions]::GetRSAPrivateKey($cert)
```

If the certificate was **issued by a Certificate Authority (CA)** use following `$path` variable:
```powershell
$path = "$env:ALLUSERSPROFILE\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\MachineKeys\$($rsaCert.key.UniqueName)"
```

If you are using a **self-signed** certificate, use the following `$path` variable:
``` powershell
$path = "$env:ALLUSERSPROFILE\Microsoft\Crypto\Keys\$($rsaCert.key.UniqueName)"
```

Then proceed to run the following commands to grant the permission:

``` powershell
$permissions = Get-Acl -Path $path
$serviceAccount = (Get-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\ADSync -Name ObjectName).ObjectName
$rule = New-Object Security.Accesscontrol.FileSystemAccessRule "$serviceAccount", "read", allow
$permissions.AddAccessRule($rule)
Set-Acl -Path $path -AclObject $permissions
 
# Verify permissions
$permissions = Get-Acl -Path $path
$permissions.Access
```

**Step 5:** Disable the sync scheduler 
```powershell
Set-ADSyncScheduler -SyncCycleEnabled $false
```

**Step 6:** Import ADSync module:
If you are using **PowerShell version 7**, use following command to import ADSync module:
``` powershell
Import-Module -Name "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Azure AD Sync\Bin\ADSync" -UseWindowsPowerShell
```

If you are using **older PowerShell versions** or **PowerShell ISE**, use following command to import ADSync module:
``` powershell
Import-Module -Name "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Azure AD Sync\Bin\ADSync"
```

**Step 7:** Update the application certificate using the certificate rotation command
``` powershell
Invoke-ADSyncApplicationCredentialRotation -CertificateSHA256Hash $certHash 
```

**Step 8:** Use the wizard view the [current authentication configuration](#view-the-current-authentication-configuration) to confirm that Microsoft Entra Connect is using your new certificate.

**Step 9:** Enable the sync scheduler
``` powershell
Set-ADSyncScheduler -SyncCycleEnabled $true
```

**Step 10:** [Remove the Directory Synchronization Account (DSA) from Microsoft Entra ID (recommended)](#remove-a-legacy-service-account).

# [BYOA with BYOC](#tab/byoa)
#### Create the application using PowerShell:

**Step 1:** Connect to your tenant
``` powershell
Connect-MgGraph -scopes "Application.ReadWrite.All", "AppRoleAssignment.ReadWrite.All"
```

**Step 2:** Create and initialize BYOA application
``` powershell
$BYOApp = New-MgApplication -DisplayName "My BYOA For Connect Sync serverName"
```

**Step 3:** Create and initialize BYOA service principal name
``` powershell
$BYOA_ServicePrincipal = New-MgServicePrincipal -AppId $BYOApp.AppId
```

**Step 4:** Initialize `ConnectSyncAppId` and `ConnectSyncSPId` variables:
``` powershell
$ConnectSyncAppId = $BYOApp.AppId
$ConnectSyncSPId = $BYOA_ServicePrincipal.Id
```

**Step 5:** Initialize `SynchronizationServiceAppId` variable that represents the application (client) ID for **Microsoft Entra AD Synchronization Service**. The value is `6bf85cfa-ac8a-4be5-b5de-425a0d0dc016` for **all clouds**:

``` powershell
$SynchronizationServiceAppId = "6bf85cfa-ac8a-4be5-b5de-425a0d0dc016"
```

**Step 6:** Initialize `SynchronizationServiceSPId` variable:
```powershell
$SynchronizationServiceSPId = (Get-MgServicePrincipal -Filter "appId eq '$SynchronizationServiceAppId'").Id
```

**Step 7:** Initialize `SynchronizationServiceAppRoleId` variable:
```powershell
$SynchronizationServiceAppRoleId =  (Get-MgServicePrincipal -Filter "appId eq '$SynchronizationServiceAppId'").AppRoles | Where-Object {$_.Value -eq "ADSynchronization.ReadWrite.All"} | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Id
```
> [!NOTE]
> If you are using **Password Writeback** feature then proceed with following steps, otherwise you can skip to step 11.

**Step 8:** Initialize `PasswordResetServiceAppId` variable:
For **all clouds** except Arlington use:
```powershell
$PasswordResetServiceAppId = "93625bc8-bfe2-437a-97e0-3d0060024faa"
```

For **Arlington** cloud use:
```powershell
$PasswordResetServiceAppId = "2e5ecfc8-ea79-48bd-8140-c19324acb278"
```

**Step 9:** Initialize `PasswordResetServiceSPId` variable:
```powershell
$PasswordResetServiceSPId = (Get-MgServicePrincipal -Filter "appId eq '$PasswordResetServiceAppId'").Id
```

**Step 10:** Initialize Password Reset AppRoles variables:
```powershell
$PasswordResetServiceServiceOffboardClientAppRoleId = (Get-MgServicePrincipal -Filter "appId eq '$PasswordResetServiceAppId'").AppRoles | Where-Object {$_.Value -eq "PasswordWriteback.OffboardClient.All"} | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Id
$PasswordResetServiceServiceRegisterClientAppRoleId = (Get-MgServicePrincipal -Filter "appId eq '$PasswordResetServiceAppId'").AppRoles | Where-Object {$_.Value -eq "PasswordWriteback.RegisterClientVersion.All"} | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Id
$PasswordResetServiceServiceRefreshClientAppRoleId = (Get-MgServicePrincipal -Filter "appId eq '$PasswordResetServiceAppId'").AppRoles | Where-Object {$_.Value -eq "PasswordWriteback.RefreshClient.All"} | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Id
```

**Step 11:** Initialize `RequiredResourceAccess` variable to configure required permissions for Microsoft Entra AD Synchronization Service and Microsoft password reset service:
If you **don’t use Password writeback**, then use:
```powershell
$RequiredResourceAccess = @(
    @{
        ResourceAppId = $SynchronizationServiceAppId
        ResourceAccess = @(
            @{
                Id = $SynchronizationServiceAppRoleId
                Type = "Role"
            }
        )
    }
)
```
If you **use Password writeback**, then use:
```powershell
$RequiredResourceAccess = @(
    @{
        ResourceAppId = $SynchronizationServiceAppId
        ResourceAccess = @(
            @{
                Id = $SynchronizationServiceAppRoleId
                Type = "Role"
            }
        )
    },
    @{
        ResourceAppId = $PasswordResetServiceAppId
        ResourceAccess = @(
            @{
                Id = $PasswordResetServiceServiceOffboardClientAppRoleId
                Type = "Role"
            },
            @{

                Type = "Role"
            }
        )
    }
)
```

**Step 12:** Update the application with the required permissions:
``` powershell
Update-MgApplication -ApplicationId $BYOApp.Id -RequiredResourceAccess $RequiredResourceAccess
```

**Step 13:** Create app role assignment for Synchronization Service:
``` powershell
$SyncAppRoleAssignment = New-MgServicePrincipalAppRoleAssignment -ServicePrincipalId $BYOA_ServicePrincipal.Id -PrincipalId $BYOA_ServicePrincipal.Id -ResourceId $SynchronizationServiceSPId -AppRoleId $SynchronizationServiceAppRoleId
```
> [!NOTE]
>If you are using **Password Writeback** feature then proceed with following steps, otherwise you can skip to step #15.

**Step 14:** Create app role assignment for Password Writeback feature:
``` powershell
$OffboardAppRoleAssignment = New-MgServicePrincipalAppRoleAssignment -ServicePrincipalId $BYOA_ServicePrincipal.Id -PrincipalId $BYOA_ServicePrincipal.Id -ResourceId $PasswordResetServiceSPId -AppRoleId $PasswordResetServiceServiceOffboardClientAppRoleId
 
$RegisterAppRoleAssignment = New-MgServicePrincipalAppRoleAssignment -ServicePrincipalId $BYOA_ServicePrincipal.Id -PrincipalId $BYOA_ServicePrincipal.Id -ResourceId $PasswordResetServiceSPId -AppRoleId $PasswordResetServiceServiceRegisterClientAppRoleId
 
$RefreshAppRoleAssignment = New-MgServicePrincipalAppRoleAssignment -ServicePrincipalId $BYOA_ServicePrincipal.Id -PrincipalId $BYOA_ServicePrincipal.Id -ResourceId $PasswordResetServiceSPId -AppRoleId $PasswordResetServiceServiceRefreshClientAppRoleId
```

**Step 15:** Export the certificate (.cer) file to upload it Entra ID App registration using one of the following options:

**Option 1**: Using mmc console to export a certificate from the Windows certificate stores:
1.	Open the certificate management console for the local computer by running the following command. Some methods of running this command are from the Start menu, the Windows Run prompt, PowerShell prompt, or command prompt.

     ``` powershell
     certlm.msc
     ```
2.	In the console tree, navigate to the certificate you want to export.
3.	Right-click the certificate, select **All Tasks**, and then select **Export**.
4.	On the screen **Welcome to the Certificate Export Wizard**, select **Next**.
5.	If prompted to export the private key, select **No, do not export the private key**, then select **Next**.
6.	For the file format, select **DER encoded binary X.509 (.CER)**, then select **Next**.
7.	Enter or browse to the file path, then select **Next**.
8.	Review the summary, then select **Finish**.

**Option 2:** Use PowerShell to export the certificate:

``` powershell
$cerFile  = "C:\Temp\MyBYOC.cer"
$cert = Get-ChildItem Cert:\LocalMachine\My | Where-Object {$_.Subject -eq 'CN=YOUR_CERTIFICATE_SUBJECT'}  
Export-Certificate -Cert $cert -FilePath $cerFile
```

**Step 16:** In Entra Admin Center https://entra.microsoft.com/ navigate to **App Registration**, and select the application that was created in step 2. Under **Certificate & secrets** click on **Upload certificate** and upload the exported .cer file and click on **Add**:

 :::image type="content" source="media/authenticate-application-id/app-registration-cert-byoa.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows uploading certificate to App Registration." lightbox="media/authenticate-application-id/app-registration-cert-byoa.png":::

**Step 17:** Get the certificate Hash using following PowerShell commands

``` powershell
$cert = Get-ChildItem Cert:\LocalMachine\My | Where-Object {$_.Subject -eq 'CN=YOUR_CERTIFICATE_SUBJECT'}  

# Get raw data from X509Certificate cert
$certRawDataString = $cert.GetRawCertData()
 
# Compute SHA256Hash of certificate 
$sha256 = [System.Security.Cryptography.SHA256]::Create()
$hashBytes = $sha256.ComputeHash($certRawDataString)
```

If you are using **PowerShell version 7**, use following command:

``` powershell
$certHash = [System.Convert]::ToHexString($hashBytes)
```

If you are using **older PowerShell versions** or **PowerShell ISE**, use following command:

``` powershell
$certHash = ($hashBytes|ForEach-Object ToString X2) -join ''
```
**Step 18:** Grant Connect Sync (ADSync) service account permissions to retrieve the certificate private key:
``` powershell
$rsaCert = [System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.RSACertificateExtensions]::GetRSAPrivateKey($cert)
```

If the certificate was **issued by a Certificate Authority (CA)** use following `$path` variable:
```powershell
$path = "$env:ALLUSERSPROFILE\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\MachineKeys\$($rsaCert.key.UniqueName)"
```

If you are using a **self-signed** certificate, use the following `$path` variable:
``` powershell
$path = "$env:ALLUSERSPROFILE\Microsoft\Crypto\Keys\$($rsaCert.key.UniqueName)"
```

Then proceed to run the following commands to grant the permission:

``` powershell
$permissions = Get-Acl -Path $path
$serviceAccount = (Get-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\ADSync -Name ObjectName).ObjectName
$rule = New-Object Security.Accesscontrol.FileSystemAccessRule "$serviceAccount", "read", allow
$permissions.AddAccessRule($rule)
Set-Acl -Path $path -AclObject $permissions
 
# Verify permissions
$permissions = Get-Acl -Path $path
$permissions.Access
```

**Step 19:** Disable the sync scheduler 
```powershell
Set-ADSyncScheduler -SyncCycleEnabled $false
```

**Step 20:** Import ADSync module:
If you are using **PowerShell version 7**, use following command to import ADSync module:
``` powershell
Import-Module -Name "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Azure AD Sync\Bin\ADSync" -UseWindowsPowerShell
```

**Step 21:** Switch to using your new application for authentication
``` powershell
Add-ADSyncApplicationRegistration -CertificateSHA256Hash $certHash –ApplicationAppId $ConnectSyncAppId 
```

**Step 22:** Use the wizard view the [current authentication configuration](#view-the-current-authentication-configuration) to confirm that Microsoft Entra Connect is using the application identity, or use PowerShell command to verify the current authentication method.

``` powershell
Get-ADSyncEntraConnectorCredential
```


**Step 23:** Enable the sync scheduler
``` powershell
Set-ADSyncScheduler -SyncCycleEnabled $true
```

**Step 24:** [Remove the Directory Synchronization Account (DSA) from Microsoft Entra ID (recommended)](#remove-a-legacy-service-account).


## Remove a legacy service account

After you transition to application-based authentication and Microsoft Entra Connect Sync is working as expected, we strongly recommend that you remove the legacy DSA username and password service account by using PowerShell. If you use a custom account that can't be removed, deprivilege it and remove the DSA role from it.

Follow these steps to remove the legacy service account.

1. Add the service account username and password.

     ``` powershell 
     $HACredential = Get-Credential
     ```

 2. You're prompted to enter the Microsoft Entra administrator `UserPrincipalName` value and the password. Enter the username and password.

 3. Next, remove the service account.

     ``` powershell
     Remove-ADSyncAADServiceAccount -AADCredential $HACredential -Name <$serviceAccountName>
     ```

    The `ServiceAccountName` value is the first part of the `UserPrincipalName` value of the service account used in Microsoft Entra ID. You can find this user in the list of users in the Microsoft Entra admin center. If the UPN is `Sync_Server_id@tenant.onmicrosoft.com`, use `Sync_Server_id` as the `ServiceAccountName` value.

## Roll back to a legacy service account by using PowerShell

If you want to go back to the legacy service account, you can use PowerShell to revert to using the service account to promptly mitigate the issue. Use the following steps to roll back to the service account.

As part of the rollback, we'll be re-creating the DSA account. This new account might take up to 15 minutes to take effect, so you might get an "Access Denied" error when you reenable the sync cycle.

1. Disable the scheduler to ensure that no sync cycles run until this change is completed.

     ``` powershell
     Set-ADSyncScheduler -SyncCycleEnabled $false
     ```

1. Add the service account. You're prompted to enter the Microsoft Entra administrator `UserPrincipalName` value and the password. Enter the credentials.

     ``` powershell
    Add-ADSyncAADServiceAccount
     ```

1. Get the current authentication mechanism and confirm that the `ConnectorIdentityType` value is back to `ServiceAccount`.

     ``` powershell
    Get-ADSyncEntraConnectorCredential
     ```

1. Reenable the scheduler to begin the synchronization service.

     ``` powershell
     Set-ADSyncScheduler -SyncCycleEnabled $true
     ```

## Certificate rotation

Microsoft Entra Connect warns if the certificate rotation is due. That is, if expiration is less than or equal to 150 days. It emits an error if the certificate is already expired. You can find these warnings (Event ID 1011) and errors (Event ID 1012) in the Application event log.

This message is emitted at the scheduler frequency if the scheduler isn't suspended. Run `Get-ADSyncScheduler` to see if the scheduler is suspended.

### Automatic

If Microsoft Entra Connect manages the certificate, *no action* is required from you unless the scheduler is suspended, Microsoft Entra Connect Sync adds the new certificate credential to the application, and tries to remove the old certificate credential. 

If it fails to remove the old certificate credential, an error event appears in the Application logs in the Event Viewer.

If you see this error, run the following cmdlet in PowerShell to clean up the old certificate credential from Microsoft Entra. The cmdlet takes the `CertificateId` value of the certificate that must be removed, which you can obtain from the log or the Microsoft Entra admin center.

 ``` powershell
Remove-EntraApplicationKey -CertificateId <certificateId>
 ```

### Manual

If your configuration isn't eligible for automatic certificate rotation, you can rotate the certificate at any point in time, even if the current certificate is still not due for rotation or the current certificate expired.

# [Default Application](#tab/default)

1. Start the **Microsoft Entra Connect wizard**
1. Go to **Additional tasks** > **Rotate application certificate** and then follow the prompts.

## Certificate revocation process

For self-signed certificates, either Microsoft Entra Managed or BYOC, an administrator must perform manual revocation by removing the `keyCredential` value from Microsoft Entra ID. An on-demand rotation of the certificate is also an option.

For BYOC certificates issued by a Certificate Authority registered with Microsoft Entra, the administrator can follow the [certificate revocation process](../../authentication/concept-certificate-based-authentication-certificate-revocation-list.md#enforce-crl-validation-for-cas).

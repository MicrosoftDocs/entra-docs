# Next steps and how to manage Microsoft Entra Connect
Use the operational procedures in this article to customize Microsoft Entra Connect to meet your organization's needs and requirements.  

## Add additional sync admins
By default, only the user who did the installation and local admins are able to manage the installed sync engine. For additional people to be able to access and manage the sync engine, locate the group named ADSyncAdmins on the local server and add them to this group.

## Assign licenses to Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 and Enterprise Mobility Suite users
Now that your users have been synchronized to the cloud, you need to assign them a license so they can get going with cloud apps such as Microsoft 365.

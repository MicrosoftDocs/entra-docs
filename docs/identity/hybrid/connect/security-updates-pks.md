# Security improvements to Microsoft Entra Connect Sync autoupgrade and Microsoft Entra Connect Health alerts 

Since September 2023, we've been autoupgrading Microsoft Entra Connect Sync and Microsoft Entra Connect Health customers to an updated build as part of a precautionary security-related service change. Customers who were autoupgraded won't be impacted by the service change, but if you opted out of autoupgrade or autoupgrade failed, we **strongly recommend** that you upgrade to the [latest versions](reference-connect-version-history.md) by **September 23, 2024**. 


## Expected impacts
The following table provides information on the features and impact to services, you may encounter, if you aren't on the minimum recommended versions.

|Service|Impact|

## Consider moving to Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync

If you're eligible, we recommend migrating from Microsoft Entra Connect Sync to Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync. Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync is the new sync client that works from the cloud and allows customers to set up and manage their sync preferences online. We recommend that you use Cloud Sync because we're introducing new features that improve the sync experiences through Cloud Sync. You can avoid future migrations by choosing Cloud Sync if that's the right option for you. Use the https://aka.ms/EvaluateSyncOptions to see if Cloud Sync is the right sync client for you. 

See the video below to understand how Cloud sync provides value to your business.

# Change the Microsoft Entra Connector account password
The Microsoft Entra Connector account is supposed to be service free. If you need to reset its credentials, then this topic is for you. For example, if a Global Administrator has by mistake reset the password on the account using PowerShell.

## Reset the credentials
If the Microsoft Entra Connector account cannot contact Microsoft Entra ID due to authentication problems, the password can be reset.

1. Sign in to the Microsoft Entra Connect Sync server and open PowerShell.
2. To provide the Microsoft Entra Global Administrator credentials, run `$credential = Get-Credential`.
3. Run the cmdlet `Add-ADSyncAADServiceAccount -AADCredential $credential`.

   If the cmdlet is successful, the PowerShell command prompt appears. 
   
The cmdlet resets the password for the service account and updates it both in Microsoft Entra ID and the sync engine.

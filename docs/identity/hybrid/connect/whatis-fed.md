# What is federation with Microsoft Entra ID?

Federation is a collection of domains that have established trust. The level of trust may vary, but typically includes authentication and almost always includes authorization. A typical federation might include a number of organizations that have established trust for shared access to a set of resources.

You can federate your on-premises environment with Microsoft Entra ID and use this federation for authentication and authorization.  This sign-in method ensures that all user authentication occurs on-premises.  This method allows administrators to implement more rigorous levels of access control. Federation with AD FS and PingFederate is available.

> [!TIP]
> If you decide to use Federation with Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), you can optionally set up password hash synchronization as a backup in case your AD FS infrastructure fails.

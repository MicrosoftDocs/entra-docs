# Auditing administrator events in Microsoft Entra Connect Sync (Public Preview)

In January 2025, we released a new version [(2.4.129.0)](reference-connect-version-history.md#241290) of Microsoft Entra Connect Sync. This version contains an update to auditing which is enabled by default. With this update, you can now monitor administrator events and activity. The following article describes how to disable the auditing feature. 


## How to manually disable auditing of administrator events
To disable auditing of administrator events, use the following steps:

1. Open the Registry Editor - Press Win + R to open the run dialog. 
2. Type **regedit** and press Enter to launch the Registry Editor. Confirm any security prompts to proceed. 
3. Navigate to the following path: **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Azure AD Connect**. 
4. Modify or Create the **AuditEventLogging** Value by right-click on the Azure AD Connect key, select New -> **DWORD (32-bit)** Value if the AuditEventLogging value doesn't already exist. 
5. Name the new DWORD as **AuditEventLogging**. 
6. Double-clicking on the **AuditEventLogging** entry and enter **0** to disable the audit event logging. Enter 1 to re-enable it.

## How to use PowerShell to disable auditing of administrator events
You can also use PowerShell to disable audit logging of administrator events. Use the following script.

 ```powershell
 #Declare variables
 $registryPath = 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Azure AD Connect'
 $valueName = 'AuditEventLogging'
 $newValue = '0'

 #Create the AuditEventLogging key if it doesn't exist
 if (!(Test-Path $registryPath)) {New-Item -Path $registryPath -Force}

 #Set the value of the new AuditEventLogging key
 Set-ItemProperty -Path $registryPath -Name $valueName -Value $newValue
 ```

## List of logged events
The following table is a list of events that are logged with the new auditing feature. To view the events, use Event Viewer and look in the Application log.

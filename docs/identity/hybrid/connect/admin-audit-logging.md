# Audit administrator events in Microsoft Entra Connect Sync

Starting from version [(2.4.129.0)](reference-connect-version-history.md#241290) of Microsoft Entra Connect Sync, a new admin audit logging feature is available and enabled by default. This feature allows organizations to monitor changes made to Microsoft Entra Connect Sync configurations by Global Administrators, Hybrid Administrators and local server administrators.

Admin actions performed through the Microsoft Entra Connect Sync Wizard, PowerShell, or the Synchronization Rules Editor—such as updates to synchronization rules, authentication settings, and federation settings are captured and logged in Windows Event Viewer Application's event log under a dedicated event source called **Entra Connect Admin Actions**. This provides improved visibility into identity infrastructure changes and supports troubleshooting, operational accountability, and regulatory compliance.

This article outlines the list of events logged by this feature and explains how to disable it, if needed.

## List of logged events

The following table is a list of events that are logged with the new auditing feature. To view the events, use the Event Viewer and view the Application log.

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend that you increase the application events log size, as the Windows default size of 20MB is relatively small and can be quickly overwritten. A minimum size of 250MB-500MB is suggested.

1. Open the Registry Editor. Select **Win+R** to open the **run** dialog.
1. Enter **regedit** and select **Enter** to open the Registry Editor. Confirm any security prompts to proceed.
1. Go to **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Azure AD Connect**.
1. Right-click the **Azure AD Connect** key to modify or create the **AuditEventLogging** value. Select **New** and select the **DWORD (32-bit)** value if the **AuditEventLogging** value doesn't already exist.
1. Name the new **DWORD** as **AuditEventLogging**.
1. Double-click the **AuditEventLogging** entry and enter **0** to disable the audit event logging. Enter **1** to reenable it.

### Use PowerShell

You can also use PowerShell to disable audit logging of administrator events. Use the following script:

 ```powershell
 #Declare variables
 $registryPath = 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Azure AD Connect'
 $valueName = 'AuditEventLogging'
 $newValue = '0'

 #Create the AuditEventLogging key if it doesn't exist
 if (!(Test-Path $registryPath)) {New-Item -Path $registryPath -Force}

 #Set the value of the new AuditEventLogging key
 Set-ItemProperty -Path $registryPath -Name $valueName -Value $newValue
 ```

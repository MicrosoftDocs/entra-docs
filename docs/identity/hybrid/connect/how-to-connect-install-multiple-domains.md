# Multiple Domain Support for Federating with Microsoft Entra ID
The following documentation provides guidance on how to use multiple top-level domains and subdomains when federating with Microsoft 365 or Microsoft Entra domains.

## Multiple top-level domain support
Federating multiple, top-level domains with Microsoft Entra ID requires some extra configuration that isn't required when federating with one top-level domain.

When a domain is federated with Microsoft Entra ID, several properties are set on the domain in Azure.  One important one is IssuerUri.  This property is a URI that is used by Microsoft Entra ID to identify the domain that the token is associated with.  The URI doesn’t need to resolve to anything but it must be a valid URI.  By default, Microsoft Entra ID sets the URI to the value of the federation service identifier in your on-premises AD FS configuration.

> [!NOTE]
> The federation service identifier is a URI that uniquely identifies a federation service.  The federation service is an instance of AD FS that functions as the security token service.
>
>

You can view the IssuerUri by using the PowerShell command `Get-MsolDomainFederationSettings -DomainName <your domain>`.

[!INCLUDE [Azure AD PowerShell deprecation note](~/../docs/reusable-content/msgraph-powershell/includes/aad-powershell-deprecation-note.md)]

A problem arises when you add more than one top-level domain.  For example, let's say you have set up federation between Microsoft Entra ID and your on-premises environment.  For this document, the domain, bmcontoso.com is being used.  Now a second, top-level domain, bmfabrikam.com has been added.

![A screenshot showing multiple top-level domains](./media/how-to-connect-install-multiple-domains/domains.png)

When you attempt to convert the bmfabrikam.com domain to be federated, an error occurs.  The reason is, Microsoft Entra ID has a constraint that doesn't allow the IssuerUri property to have the same value for more than one domain.  

![Screenshot that shows a federation error in PowerShell.](./media/how-to-connect-install-multiple-domains/error.png)

### SupportMultipleDomain Parameter
To work around this constraint, you need to add a different IssuerUri, which can be done by using the `-SupportMultipleDomain` parameter.  This parameter is used with the following cmdlets:

* `New-MsolFederatedDomain`
* `Convert-MsolDomaintoFederated`
* `Update-MsolFederatedDomain`

This parameter makes Microsoft Entra ID configure the IssuerUri so that it's based on the name of the domain.  The IssuerUri will be unique across directories in Microsoft Entra ID.  Using the parameter allows the PowerShell command to complete successfully.

![Screenshot that shows a successful completion of the PowerShell command.](./media/how-to-connect-install-multiple-domains/convert.png)

Looking at the screenshot for the bmfabrikam.com domain you can see the following settings:

![Screenshot that shows the settings for the "bmfabrikam.com" domain.](./media/how-to-connect-install-multiple-domains/settings.png)

`-SupportMultipleDomain` doesn't change the other endpoints, which are still configured to point to the federation service on adfs.bmcontoso.com.

`-SupportMultipleDomain` also ensures that the AD FS system includes the proper Issuer value in tokens issued for Microsoft Entra ID. This value is set by taking the domain portion of the user's UPN and using it as the domain in the IssuerUri, that is, `https://{upn suffix}/adfs/services/trust`.

Thus during authentication to Microsoft Entra ID or Microsoft 365, the IssuerUri element in the user’s token is used to locate the domain in Microsoft Entra ID. If, a match can't be found, the authentication will fail.

For example, if a user’s UPN is bsimon@bmcontoso.com, the IssuerUri element in the token, AD FS issuer, will be set to `http://bmcontoso.com/adfs/services/trust`. This element will match the Microsoft Entra configuration, and authentication will succeed.

The following customized claim rule implements this logic:

```
c:[Type == "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/claims/UPN"] => issue(Type = "http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/issuerid", Value = regexreplace(c.Value, ".+@(?<domain>.+)", "http://${domain}/adfs/services/trust/"));
```


> [!IMPORTANT]
> In order to use the -SupportMultipleDomain switch when attempting to add new or convert already existing domains, your federated trust needs to have already been set up to support them.

## How to update the trust between AD FS and Microsoft Entra ID
If you didn't set up the federated trust between AD FS and your instance of Microsoft Entra ID, you may need to re-create this trust.  The reason is, when it's originally set up without the `-SupportMultipleDomain` parameter, the IssuerUri is set with the default value.  In the screenshot below, you can see the IssuerUri is set to `https://adfs.bmcontoso.com/adfs/services/trust`.

If you have successfully added a new domain in the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) and then attempt to convert it using `Convert-MsolDomaintoFederated -DomainName <your domain>`, you'll get the following error.

![Screenshot that shows a federation error in PowerShell after attempting to convert a new domain with the "Convert-MsolDomaintoFederated" command.](./media/how-to-connect-install-multiple-domains/trust1.png)

If you try to add the `-SupportMultipleDomain` switch, you'll receive the following error:

![Screenshot that shows a federation error after adding the "-SupportMultipleDomain" switch.](./media/how-to-connect-install-multiple-domains/trust2.png)

Simply trying to run `Update-MsolFederatedDomain -DomainName <your domain> -SupportMultipleDomain` on the original domain will also result in an error.

Use the steps below to add an additional top-level domain.  If you have already added a domain, and didn't use the `-SupportMultipleDomain` parameter, start with the steps for removing and updating your original domain.  If you haven't added a top-level domain yet, you can start with the steps for adding a domain using PowerShell of Microsoft Entra Connect.

Use the following steps to remove the Microsoft Online trust and update your original domain.

1. On your AD FS federation server open **AD FS Management**.
2. On the left, expand **Trust Relationships** and **Relying Party Trusts**.
3. On the right, delete the **Microsoft Office 365 Identity Platform** entry.
   ![Remove Microsoft Online](./media/how-to-connect-install-multiple-domains/trust4.png)
4. On a machine that has [Azure AD PowerShell module](/previous-versions/azure/jj151815(v=azure.100)) installed on it run the following PowerShell: `$cred=Get-Credential`.
5. Enter the username and password of a Hybrid Identity Administrator for the Microsoft Entra domain you are federating with.
6. In PowerShell, enter `Connect-MsolService -Credential $cred`.
7. In PowerShell, enter `Update-MSOLFederatedDomain -DomainName <Federated Domain Name> -SupportMultipleDomain`. This update is for the original domain. So using the above domains it would be: `Update-MsolFederatedDomain -DomainName bmcontoso.com -SupportMultipleDomain`

Use the following steps to add the new top-level domain using PowerShell

1. On a machine that has [Azure AD PowerShell module](/previous-versions/azure/jj151815(v=azure.100)) installed on it run the following PowerShell: `$cred=Get-Credential`.
2. Enter the username and password of a Hybrid Identity Administrator for the Microsoft Entra domain you are federating with
3. In PowerShell, enter `Connect-MsolService -Credential $cred`
4. In PowerShell, enter `New-MsolFederatedDomain –SupportMultipleDomain –DomainName`

Use the following steps to add the new top-level domain using Microsoft Entra Connect.

1. Launch Microsoft Entra Connect from the desktop or start menu
2. Choose “Add an additional Microsoft Entra Domain”
   ![Screenshot that shows the "Additional tasks" page with "Add an additional Microsoft Entra domain" selected.](./media/how-to-connect-install-multiple-domains/add1.png)
3. Enter your Microsoft Entra ID and Active Directory credentials
4. Select the second domain you wish to configure for federation.
   ![Add an additional Microsoft Entra domain](./media/how-to-connect-install-multiple-domains/add2.png)
5. Click Install

### Verify the new top-level domain
By using the PowerShell command `Get-MsolDomainFederationSettings -DomainName <your domain>`you can view the updated IssuerUri.  The screenshot below shows the federation settings were updated on the original domain `http://bmcontoso.com/adfs/services/trust`

![Screenshot that shows the federation settings updated on the original domain.](./media/how-to-connect-install-multiple-domains/MsolDomainFederationSettings.png)

And the IssuerUri on the new domain has been set to `https://bmcontoso.com/adfs/services/trust`

## Support for subdomains
When you add a subdomain, because of the way Microsoft Entra ID handled domains, it will inherit the settings of the parent.  So, the IssuerUri, needs to match the parents.

So lets say, for example, that I have bmcontoso.com and then add corp.bmcontoso.com.  The IssuerUri for a user from corp.bmcontoso.com will need to be **`http://bmcontoso.com/adfs/services/trust`**.  However the standard rule implemented above for Microsoft Entra ID, will generate a token with an issuer as **`http://corp.bmcontoso.com/adfs/services/trust`**. which won't match the domain's required value and authentication will fail.

### How To enable support for subdomains
In order to work around this behavior, the AD FS relying party trust for Microsoft Online needs to be updated.  To do this, you must configure a custom claim rule so that it strips off any subdomains from the user’s UPN suffix when constructing the custom Issuer value.

Use the following claim:

```    
c:[Type == "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/claims/UPN"] => issue(Type = "http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/issuerid", Value = regexreplace(c.Value, "^.*@([^.]+\.)*?(?<domain>([^.]+\.?){2})$", "http://${domain}/adfs/services/trust/"));
```

[!NOTE]
The last number in the regular expression set is how many parent domains there are in your root domain. Here bmcontoso.com is used, so two parent domains are necessary. If three parent domains were to be kept (that is, corp.bmcontoso.com), then the number would have been three. Eventually a range can be indicated, the match will always be made to match the maximum of domains. "{2,3}" will match two to three domains (that is, bmfabrikam.com and corp.bmcontoso.com).

Use the following steps to add a custom claim to support subdomains.

1. Open AD FS Management
2. Right-click the Microsoft Online RP trust and choose Edit Claim rules
3. Select the third claim rule, and replace
   ![Edit claim](./media/how-to-connect-install-multiple-domains/sub1.png)
4. Replace the current claim:

   ```
   c:[Type == "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/claims/UPN"] => issue(Type = "http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/issuerid", Value = regexreplace(c.Value, ".+@(?<domain>.+)","http://${domain}/adfs/services/trust/"));
   ```
    with

   ```
   c:[Type == "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/claims/UPN"] => issue(Type = "http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/issuerid", Value = regexreplace(c.Value, "^.*@([^.]+\.)*?(?<domain>([^.]+\.?){2})$", "http://${domain}/adfs/services/trust/"));
   ```

    ![Replace claim](./media/how-to-connect-install-multiple-domains/sub2.png)

5. Click Ok.  Click Apply.  Click Ok.  Close AD FS Management.

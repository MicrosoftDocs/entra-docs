# Microsoft Entra Connect and federation
Microsoft Entra Connect lets you configure federation with on-premises Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) and Microsoft Entra ID. With federation sign-in, you can enable users to sign in to Microsoft Entra ID-based services with their on-premises passwords--and, while on the corporate network, without having to enter their passwords again. By using the federation option with AD FS, you can deploy a new installation of AD FS, or you can specify an existing installation in a Windows Server 2012 R2 farm.

This topic is the home for information on federation-related functionalities for Microsoft Entra Connect. It lists links to all related topics. For links to Microsoft Entra Connect, see [Integrating your on-premises identities with Microsoft Entra ID](../whatis-hybrid-identity.md).

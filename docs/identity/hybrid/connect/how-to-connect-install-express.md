# Get started with Microsoft Entra Connect Sync by using express settings

It's only a few short steps to extend your on-premises directory to the cloud.

 6. In **Connect to AD DS**, enter the username and password for an Enterprise Admin account. You can enter the domain part in either NetBIOS or FQDN format, like `FABRIKAM\administrator` or `fabrikam.com\administrator`. Select **Next**.

  :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-connect-install-express/install-6.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Connect to AD DS page in the installation wizard." lightbox="media/how-to-connect-install-express/install-6.png":::

 7. The [Microsoft Entra ID sign-in configuration](plan-connect-user-signin.md#azure-ad-sign-in-configuration) page appears only if you didn't complete the step to [verify your domains](~/fundamentals/add-custom-domain.yml) in the [prerequisites](how-to-connect-install-prerequisites.md).

  :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-connect-install-express/install-7.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows examples of unverified domains in the installation wizard." lightbox="media/how-to-connect-install-express/install-7.png":::

 If you see this page, review each domain that's marked **Not Added** or **Not Verified**. Make sure that those domains have been verified in Microsoft Entra ID. When you've verified your domains, select the **Refresh** icon.

 8. In **Ready to configure**, select **Install**.

   - Optionally in **Ready to configure**, you can clear the **Start the synchronization process as soon as configuration completes** checkbox. You should clear this checkbox if you want to do more configurations, such as to add [filtering](how-to-connect-sync-configure-filtering.md). If you clear this option, the wizard configures sync but leaves the scheduler disabled. The scheduler doesn't run until you enable it manually by [rerunning the installation wizard](how-to-connect-installation-wizard.md).
   - If you leave the **Start the synchronization process when configuration completes** checkbox selected, a full sync of all users, groups, and contacts to Microsoft Entra ID begins immediately.
   - If you have Exchange in your instance of Windows Server Active Directory, you also have the option to enable [Exchange Hybrid deployment](/exchange/exchange-hybrid). Enable this option if you plan to have Exchange mailboxes both in the cloud and on-premises at the same time.

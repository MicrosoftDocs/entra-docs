# Microsoft Entra pass-through authentication: Current limitations

## Supported scenarios

The following scenarios are supported:

- User sign-ins to web browser-based applications.
- User sign-ins to legacy Office client applications and Office applications that support [modern authentication](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2015/11/19/updated-office-365-modern-authentication-public-preview): Office 2013 and 2016 versions.
- User sign-ins to legacy protocol applications such as PowerShell version 1.0 and others.
- Microsoft Entra joins for Windows 10 and later devices.
- Hybrid Microsoft Entra joins for Windows 10 and later devices. 

## Unsupported scenarios

The following scenarios are _not_ supported:

- Detection of users with [leaked credentials](~/id-protection/overview-identity-protection.md).
- Microsoft Entra Domain Services needs Password Hash Synchronization to be enabled on the tenant. Therefore tenants that use Pass-through Authentication _only_ don't work for scenarios that need Microsoft Entra Domain Services.
- Pass-through Authentication is not integrated with [Microsoft Entra Connect Health](./whatis-azure-ad-connect.md).
- Signing in to Microsoft Entra joined (AADJ) devices with a temporary or expired password is not supported for Pass-through authentication users. The error "the sign-in method you're trying to use isn't allowed" will appear.  These users must sign in to a browser to update their temporary password.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As a workaround for unsupported scenarios _only_ (except Microsoft Entra Connect Health integration), enable Password Hash Synchronization on the [Optional features](how-to-connect-install-custom.md#optional-features) page in the Microsoft Entra Connect wizard.
> 
> [!NOTE]
> Enabling Password Hash Synchronization gives you the option to failover authentication if your on-premises infrastructure is disrupted. This failover from Pass-through Authentication to Password Hash Synchronization is not automatic. You'll need to switch the sign-in method manually using Microsoft Entra Connect. If the server running Microsoft Entra Connect goes down, you'll require help from Microsoft Support to turn off Pass-through Authentication.

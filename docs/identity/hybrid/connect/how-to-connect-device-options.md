# Microsoft Entra Connect: Device options

The following documentation provides information about the various device options available in Microsoft Entra Connect. You can use Microsoft Entra Connect to configure the following two operations: 
* **Microsoft Entra hybrid join**: If your environment has an on-premises AD footprint and you want the benefits of Microsoft Entra ID, you can implement Microsoft Entra hybrid joined devices. These devices are joined  both to your on-premises Active Directory, and your Microsoft Entra ID.
* **Device writeback**: Device writeback is used to enable Conditional Access based on devices to AD FS (2012 R2 or higher) protected devices

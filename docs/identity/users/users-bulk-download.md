# Download a list of users in Azure portal

Microsoft Entra ID, part of Microsoft Entra, supports bulk user list download operations.

## Required permissions

Both admin and standard users can download user lists.

## To download a list of users


1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com).
1. Select Microsoft Entra ID.
1. Select **Users** > **All users** > **Download users**. By default, all user profiles are exported.
1. On the **Download users** page, select **Start** to receive a CSV file listing user profile properties. If there are errors, you can download and view the results file on the **Bulk operation results** page. The file contains the reason for each error.

## Improved Bulk user download in Entra admin center (Preview)

The enhanced bulk user download experience includes: 

**Customizable Columns for Export**: Previously, user exports included only a fixed set of predefined attributes. With this update, admins can customize their User List View columns, and the export will mirror those selected columns. This gives IT admins greater control and relevance in the data they download.

**Expanded Attribute Coverage**: 27 new user attributes are now added to the exportable list, enabling deeper insights and more tailored exports. See full list of these newly exportable attributes:

1. Assigned licenses
2. Authorization info
3. Employee ID
4. Employee hire date
5. Employee org data
6. Employee type
7. Extension attributes
8. External user state change date time
9. Fax number
10. IM addresses
11. Last password change date time
12. Last interactive sign-in date
13. Last non-interactive sign-in date
14. On-premises SAM account name
15. On-premises distinguished name
16. On-premises domain name
17. On-premises immutable ID
18. On-premises last sync date time
19. On-premises provisioning errors
20. On-premises security identifier
21. On-premises user principal name
22. Password policies
23. Password profile
24. Preferred data location
25. Preferred language
26. Proxy addresses
27. Sign in sessions valid from date time

>[!NOTE]
> Columns derived from complex properties are exported as the entire complex property. For example, downloading the **Last interactive sign-in date** column results in the entire signInActivity property, along with all its related data fields, to be included in the csv file.  

 ### Performance improvements

The bulk download process is now up to 12 to 15 times faster, improving experience and efficiency for large user lists. This improvement also gets rid of the service limitation that exists today which creates issues if the bulk operation doesnâ€™t complete within 1 hour.  

### User experience

1. Click on **Download users (Preview)** button from command bar on **All users** page

# Bulk remove group members in Microsoft Entra ID

You can remove a large number of members from a group by using a comma-separated values (CSV) file to remove group members in bulk using the portal for Microsoft Entra ID.

## Understand the CSV template

Download and fill in the bulk upload CSV template to successfully add Microsoft Entra group members in bulk. Your CSV template might look like this example:

:::image type="content" source="./media/groups-bulk-remove-members/template-example.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the spreadsheet for upload and call-outs explaining the purpose and values for each row and column.":::

### CSV template structure

The rows in a downloaded CSV template are:

- **Version number**: The first row that contains the version number must be included in the upload CSV.
- **Column headings**: The format of the column headings is &lt;*Item name*&gt; [PropertyName] &lt;*Required or blank*&gt;. An example is `Member object ID or user principal name [memberObjectIdOrUpn] Required`. Some older versions of the template might have slight variations. For group membership changes, you can choose the member object ID or the user principal name.
- **Examples row**: The template includes a row of examples of acceptable values for each column. You must remove the examples row and replace it with your own entries.

### More guidance

- The first two rows of the upload template must not be removed or modified or the upload can't be processed.
- The required columns are listed first.
- We don't recommend adding new columns to the template. Any other columns you add are ignored and not processed.
- We recommend that you download the latest version of the CSV template as often as possible.

If you experience errors, you can download and view the results file on the **Bulk operation results** page. The file contains the reason for each error. The file submission must match the provided template and include the exact column names.

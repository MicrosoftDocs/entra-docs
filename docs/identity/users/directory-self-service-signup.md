# What is self-service sign-up for Microsoft Entra ID?

This article explains how to use self-service sign-up to populate an organization in Microsoft Entra ID, part of Microsoft Entra. If you want to take over a domain name from an unmanaged Microsoft Entra organization, see [Take over an unmanaged tenant as administrator](domains-admin-takeover.md).

## Why use self-service sign-up?

* Get customers to services they want faster
* Create email-based offers for a service
* Create email-based sign-up flows that quickly allow users to create identities using their easy-to-remember work email aliases
* A self-service-created Microsoft Entra tenant can be turned into a managed tenant that can be used for other services

## Terms and definitions

* **Self-service sign-up** is the method by which a user signs up for a cloud service and has an identity automatically created for them in Microsoft Entra ID based on their email domain.
* An **unmanaged Microsoft Entra tenant** is the tenant where that identity is created. An unmanaged tenant is a tenant that has no Global Administrator.
* An **email-verified user** is a type of user account in Microsoft Entra ID. A user who has an identity created automatically after signing up for a self-service offer is known as an email-verified user. An email-verified user is a regular member of a tenant tagged with creationmethod=EmailVerified.


## How do I control self-service settings?

Admins have two self-service controls today. They can control whether:

* Users can join the tenant via email
* Users can license themselves for applications and services

### How can I control these capabilities?

An admin can configure these capabilities using the following Microsoft Entra cmdlet Update-MgPolicyAuthorizationPolicy parameters:

* **allowEmailVerifiedUsersToJoinOrganization** controls whether users can join the tenant by email validation. To join, the user must have an email address in a domain that matches one of the verified domains in the tenant. This setting is applied company-wide for all domains in the tenant. If you set that parameter to $false, no email-verified user can join the tenant.
* **allowedToSignUpEmailBasedSubscriptions** controls the ability for users to perform self-service sign-up. If you set that parameter to $false, no user can perform self-service sign-up.
  
allowEmailVerifiedUsersToJoinOrganization and allowedToSignUpEmailBasedSubscriptions are tenant-wide settings that can be applied to a managed or unmanaged tenant. Here's an example where:

* You administer a tenant with a verified domain such as contoso.com
* You use B2B collaboration from a different tenant to invite a user that doesn't already exist (userdoesnotexist@contoso.com) in the home tenant of contoso.com
* The home tenant has the allowedToSignUpEmailBasedSubscriptions turned on

If the preceding conditions are true, then a member user is created in the home tenant, and a B2B guest user is created in the inviting tenant.

>[!NOTE]
> Office 365 for Education users, are currently the only ones who are added to existing managed tenants even when this toggle is enabled

* [Flow in your organization Q&A](/power-automate/organization-q-and-a)

### How do the controls work together?
These two parameters can be used in conjunction to define more precise control over self-service sign-up. For example, the following command allows users to perform self-service sign-up, but only if those users already have an account in Microsoft Entra ID (in other words, users who would need an email-verified account to be created first can't perform self-service sign-up):

```powershell
Import-Module Microsoft.Graph.Identity.SignIns
connect-MgGraph -Scopes "Policy.ReadWrite.Authorization"
$param = @{
 allowedToSignUpEmailBasedSubscriptions=$true
 allowEmailVerifiedUsersToJoinOrganization=$false
 }
Update-MgPolicyAuthorizationPolicy -BodyParameter $param
```

The following flowchart explains the different combinations for these parameters and the resulting conditions for the tenant and self-service sign-up.

You can retrieve this setting's details using the PowerShell cmdlet Get-MgPolicyAuthorizationPolicy. For more information, see [Get-MgPolicyAuthorizationPolicy](/powershell/module/microsoft.graph.identity.signins/get-mgpolicyauthorizationpolicy).

```powershell
Get-MgPolicyAuthorizationPolicy | Select-Object AllowedToSignUpEmailBasedSubscriptions, AllowEmailVerifiedUsersToJoinOrganization
```

For more information and examples of how to use these parameters, see [Update-MgPolicyAuthorizationPolicy](/powershell/module/microsoft.graph.identity.signins/update-mgpolicyauthorizationpolicy?view=graph-powershell-1.0&preserve-view=true).

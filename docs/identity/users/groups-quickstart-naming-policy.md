#Customer intent: As a Microsoft Entra identity administrator, I want to enforce naming policy on self-service groups, to help me sort and search in my Microsoft Entra organizationâ€™s user-created groups.

# Quickstart: Naming policy for groups in Microsoft Entra ID

In this quickstart, in Microsoft Entra ID, part of Microsoft Entra, you will set up naming policy in your Microsoft Entra organization for user-created Microsoft 365 groups, to help you sort and search your groups. For example, you could use the naming policy to:

* Communicate the function of a group, membership, geographic region, or who created the group.
* Help categorize groups in the address book.
* Block specific words from being used in group names and aliases.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Configure the group naming policy

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Global Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#global-administrator).
1. Select Microsoft Entra ID.
1. Select **Groups** > **All groups**  then select **Naming policy** to open the Naming policy page.

# Bulk delete users in Microsoft Entra ID

Using the admin center in Microsoft Entra ID, part of Microsoft Entra, you can remove a large number of members to a group by using a comma-separated values (CSV) file to bulk delete users.

## To bulk delete users

[!INCLUDE [portal updates](~/includes/portal-update.md)]

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Global Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#global-administrator).
1. Select Microsoft Entra ID.
1. Select **Users** > **All users** > **Bulk operations** > **Bulk delete**.

1. On the **Bulk delete user** page, select **Download** to download the latest version of the CSV template.
1. Open the CSV file and add a line for each user you want to delete. The only required value is **User principal name**. Save the file.
1. On the **Bulk delete user** page, under **Upload your csv file**, browse to the file. When you select the file and click submit, validation of the CSV file starts.
1. When the file contents are validated, youâ€™ll see **File uploaded successfully**. If there are errors, you must fix them before you can submit the job.
1. When your file passes validation, select **Submit** to start the bulk operation that deletes the users.
1. When the deletion operation completes, you'll see a notification that the bulk operation succeeded.

If there are errors, you can download and view the results file on the **Bulk operation results** page. The file contains the reason for each error.

[!INCLUDE [Bulk update warning](~/includes/bulk-export.md)]

## CSV template structure

The rows in the example downloaded CSV template below are as follows:

- **Version number**: The first row containing the version number must be included in the upload CSV.
- **Column headings**: `User name [userPrincipalName] Required`. Older versions of the template might vary.
- **Examples row**: We have included in the template an example of an acceptable value. `Example: chris@contoso.com` You must remove the example row and replace it with your own entries.

### Additional guidance for the CSV template

- The first two rows of the template must not be removed or modified, or the template can't be processed.
- The required columns are listed first.
- Don't add new columns to the template. Any additional columns you add are ignored and not processed.
- Download the latest version of the CSV template before making new changes.

## Check status

You can see the status of all of your pending bulk requests in the **Bulk operation results** page.

Next, you can check to see that the users you deleted exist in the Microsoft Entra organization either in the  portal or by using PowerShell.

## Verify deleted users

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [User Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#user-administrator).
1. Select Microsoft Entra ID.
1. Select **All users** only and verify that the users you deleted are no longer listed.

### Verify deleted users with PowerShell

Run the following command:

``` PowerShell
Get-MgUser -Filter "UserType eq 'Member'"
```

Verify that the users that you deleted are no longer listed.

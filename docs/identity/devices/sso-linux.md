# What is Microsoft Single Sign-on to Linux?

Microsoft Single Sign-on (SSO) for Linux is powered by a software component that can be installed onto a Linux device that integrates with Microsoft Entra ID. Microsoft SSO for Linux enable users to use their Microsoft Entra ID credentials to sign-in to other apps without being prompted for credentials each time a resource is accessed. This feature provides benefits for admins by simplifying the sign-in process for users and reducing the number of passwords they need to remember. 

## Features

This feature empowers users on Linux desktop clients to register their devices with Microsoft Entra ID, enroll into Intune management, and satisfy device-based conditional access policies when accessing their corporate resources.

- Provides Microsoft Entra ID registration & enrollment of Linux desktops
- Provides SSO capabilities for native & web applications (ex: Azure CLI, Microsoft Edge Browser, Teams PWA, etc.) to access M365/Azure protected resources
- Provides SSO for Microsoft Entra accounts across all applications that utilize MSAL.NET or MSAL.python - enabling customers to use Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) to integrate SSO into custom apps.
- Enables Conditional Access policies protecting web applications via Microsoft Edge
- Enables Standard compliance policies
- Enables support for Bash scripts for custom compliance policies

The Teams web application and a new PWA (Progressive Web App) for Linux uses the Conditional Access configuration, applied throughÂ Microsoft Intune Manager, to enable Linux users to access the Teams web application using Microsoft Edge in a secure way. This capability helps organizations use an industry-leading, unified endpoint management solution for Teams from Linux endpoints with security and quality in mind.

## Requirements

The Microsoft single sign-on for Linux is supported with the following operating systems (physical or Hyper-V machine with x86/64 CPUs):  
 - Ubuntu Desktop 24.04, 22.04 or 20.04 LTS  
 - RedHat Enterprise Linux 8  
 - RedHat Enterprise Linux 9

## Configuration

You can find more information and instructions on how to configure in these articles:
- [Configure Platform SSO for macOS devices in Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/configuration/platform-sso-macos)

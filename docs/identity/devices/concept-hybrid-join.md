# Microsoft Entra hybrid joined devices

Organizations with existing Active Directory implementations can benefit from some of the functionality provided by Microsoft Entra ID by implementing Microsoft Entra hybrid joined devices. These devices are joined to your on-premises Active Directory and registered with Microsoft Entra ID.

Microsoft Entra hybrid joined devices require network line of sight to your on-premises domain controllers periodically. Without this connection, devices become unusable. If this requirement is a concern, consider [Microsoft Entra joining](concept-directory-join.md) your devices.

* Answer the fundamental "Why do I want this knowledge?" question.
* Don't start the article with a bunch of notes or caveats.

* Follow the H2 headings with a sentence about how the section contributes to the whole.
* Describe the concept's critical features in the context of defining what it is.
* Provide an example of how it's used where, how it fits into the context, or what it does. If it's complex and new to the user, show at least two examples.
* Provide a non-example if contrasting it will make it clearer to the user what the concept is.
* Images, code blocks, or other graphical elements come after the text block it illustrates.
* Don't number H2s.

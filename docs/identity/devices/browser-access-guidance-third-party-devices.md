# Browser access guidance for third party mobile device management providers

Update your [Android Device policy](https://developers.google.com/android/management/reference/rest/v1/enterprises.policies) resource to support automatically enabling browser access during device registration.

As announced in September 2024 and November 2025 in the Whatâ€™s New in Microsoft Entra blog, we are automatically enabling browser access by default for Android users. This change is part of hardening all Microsoft products as part of the [Secure Future Initiative](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-cloud/resources/secure-future-initiative). As part of this initiative, we are eliminating the mechanism to export device registration keys from device storage after registration completes. 


This change means that users of Android devices will no longer be able to modify their browser access settings in Authenticator app or Company Portal after their device has been registered in Microsoft Entra ID.  Instead, Android users will have browser access enabled by default.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Required: In a series of H2 sections, the article body should discuss the ideas that explain how "X is a (type of) Y that does Z":

* Give each H2 a heading that sets expectations for the content that follows.
* Follow the H2 headings with a sentence about how the section contributes to the whole.
* Describe the concept's critical features in the context of defining what it is.
* Provide an example of how it's used where, how it fits into the context, or what it does. If it's complex and new to the user, show at least two examples.
* Provide a non-example if contrasting it will make it clearer to the user what the concept is.
* Images, code blocks, or other graphical elements come after the text block it illustrates.
* Don't number H2s.

# Enable Kerberos SSO to on-premises Active Directory and Microsoft Entra ID Kerberos resources in Platform SSO

Mac users can join their new device to Microsoft Entra ID during the first-run out-of-box experience (OOBE). The macOS Platform single sign-on (PSSO) is a capability on macOS that is enabled using the [Microsoft Enterprise Single Sign-on Extension](../../identity-platform/apple-sso-plugin.md). PSSO allows users to sign in to a Mac device using a hardware-bound key, smart card, or their Microsoft Entra ID password.

This tutorial shows you how to configure Platform SSO to support Kerberos-based SSO to on-premises and cloud resources, in addition to SSO to Microsoft Entra ID. Kerberos SSO is an optional capability within Platform SSO, but it's recommended if users still need to access on-premises Active Directory resources that use Kerberos for authentication.

## Prerequisites

- A minimum version of **macOS 14.6 Sonoma**.
- [Microsoft Intune Company Portal](/mem/intune/apps/apps-company-portal-macos) version 5.2408.0 or later
- A Mac device enrolled in mobile device management (MDM).
- A configured SSO extension MDM payload with Platform SSO settings by an administrator, already deployed to the device. Refer to the [Platform SSO documentation](./macos-psso.md) or [Intune deployment guide](/mem/intune/configuration/platform-sso-macos) if Intune is your MDM.
- Deploy Microsoft Entra Kerberos, which is required for some Kerberos capabilities in on-premises Active Directory. Refer to the [Cloud Kerberos trust deployment guide for Windows Hello for Business](/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/deploy/hybrid-cloud-kerberos-trust) for more details or refer directly to the [Cloud Kerberos trust configuration instructions](/entra/identity/authentication/howto-authentication-passwordless-security-key-on-premises#install-the-azureadhybridauthenticationmanagement-module) to begin the setup. If you have already deployed Windows Hello for Business with Cloud Kerberos trust or passwordless security key sign-in for Windows, then this step has already been completed.

## Set up your macOS device

Refer to the [Microsoft Entra ID macOS Platform SSO documentation](./macos-psso.md) to learn how to configure and deploy Platform SSO. Platform SSO should be deployed on Enterprise-managed Macs regardless of whether you choose to deploy Kerberos SSO using this guide.

## Kerberos SSO MDM profile configuration

You must configure a Kerberos SSO MDM profile. Use the following settings, ensuring that you replace all references to **contoso.com** and **Contoso** with the proper values for your environment:

| Configuration Key | Recommended Value | Note |
|-|-|-|
| `preferredKDCs` | `<string>kkdcp://login.microsoftonline.com/contoso.com/kerberos</string>` | Replace the **contoso.com** value with the value of one of your tenant domains or your tenant's GUID |
| `Hosts` | `<string>contoso.com</string>` | Replace **contoso.com** with your on-premises domain/forest name |
| `Hosts` | `<string>*.contoso.com</string>` | Replace **contoso.com** with your on-premises domain/forest name. Keep the preceding `*.` characters before your domain/forest name |
| `PayloadOrganization` | `<string>Contoso</string>` | Replace **Contoso** with the name of your organization |

```

Save the configuration using a text editor with the *mobileconfig* file extension (for example, the file could be named *kerberos.mobileconfig*) after you have updated the configuration with the proper values for your environment.

### Intune configuration steps

If you use Intune as your MDM, you can perform the following steps to deploy the profile. Make sure you follow the [previous instructions](#kerberos-sso-mdm-profile-configuration) about replacing **contoso.com** values with the proper values for your organization.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
2. Select **Devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **New policy**.
3. Enter the following properties:
    - **Platform**: Select **macOS**.
    - **Profile type**: Select **Templates**.
4. Choose the **Custom** template and select **Create**.
5. In **Basics**, enter the following properties:
    - **Name**: Enter a descriptive name for the policy. Name your policies so you can easily identify them later. For example, name the policy **macOS - Platform SSO Kerberos**.
    - **Description**: Enter a description for the policy. This setting is optional, but recommended.
6. Select **Next**.
7. Enter a name in the **Custom configuration profile name** box.
8. Choose a **Deployment channel**. Device channel is recommended.
9. Click the folder icon to upload your **Configuration profile file**. Choose the *kerberos.mobileconfig* file you [saved previously](#kerberos-sso-mdm-profile-configuration) after customizing the template.
10. Select **Next**.
11. In **Scope tags** (optional), assign a tag to filter the profile to specific IT groups, such as `US-NC IT Team` or `JohnGlenn_ITDepartment`. Select **Next**.
  - For more information about scope tags, see [Use RBAC roles and scope tags for distributed IT](/mem/intune/fundamentals/scope-tags).
12. In **Assignments**, select the users or user groups that will receive your profile. Platform SSO policies are user-based policies. Don't assign the platform SSO policy to devices.
    - For more information on assigning profiles, see [Assign user and device profiles](/mem/intune/configuration/device-profile-assign).
13. Select **Next**.
14. In **Review + create**, review your settings. When you select **Create**, your changes are saved, and the profile is assigned. The policy is also shown in the profiles list.

The next time the device checks for configuration updates, the settings you configured are applied.

### Testing Kerberos SSO

Once the profile has been assigned to the device, you can check that your device has Kerberos tickets by running the following command in the Terminal app:

```console
app-sso platform -s
```

You should have two Kerberos tickets, one for your on-premises AD with the ticketKeyPath value of **tgt_ad** and one for your Microsoft Entra ID tenant with the ticketKeyPath value of **tgt_cloud**. The output should resemble the following:

Validate your configuration is working by testing with appropriate Kerberos-capable resources:

1. Test on-premises Active Directory functionality by accessing an on-premises AD-integrated file server using Finder or a web application using Safari. The user should be able to access the file share without being challenged for interactive credentials.
2. Test Microsoft Entra ID Kerberos functionality by accessing an Azure Files share enabled for Microsoft Entra ID cloud kerberos. The user should be able to access the file share without being challenged for interactive credentials. Refer to [this guide](/azure/storage/files/storage-files-identity-auth-hybrid-identities-enable) if you need to configure a cloud file share in Azure Files.

## Known Issues

### Kerberos SSO extension menu extra

When deploying support for Kerberos SSO with Platform SSO, the standard Kerberos SSO extension capabilities of macOS are still leveraged. Like with a deployment of the native [Kerberos SSO extension](https://support.apple.com/guide/deployment/kerberos-sso-extension-depe6a1cda64/web) without Platform SSO, the Kerberos SSO extension menu extra will appear in the macOS menu bar:

:::image type="content" source="media/device-registration-macos-platform-single-sign-on/platform-sso-kerberos-menu-bar-applet.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the macOS Kerberos SSO extension menu extra.":::

When deploying Kerberos support with Platform SSO, users do not need to interact with the Kerberos SSO extension menu extra to have Kerberos functionality work. Kerberos SSO functionality will still operate if the user does not sign into the menu bar extra and the menu bar extra reports "Not signed in". You may instruct users to ignore the menu bar extra when deploying with Platform SSO, per this article. Instead, make sure that you validate that kerberos functionality works as expected without interaction with the menu bar extra, as outlined in the [Testing Kerberos SSO](#testing-kerberos-sso) section of this article.

### Browser Support for Kerberos SSO

Some browsers require additional configuration to enable Kerberos SSO support, including if you are using Platform SSO to enable Kerberos on your macOS devices. When deploying Kerberos support on macOS, deploy the appropriate settings for each of the browsers you utilize to ensure they can interact with the macOS Kerberos SSO features:

- Safari: supports Kerberos SSO by default
- Microsoft Edge:
    - Configure the **AuthNegotiateDelegateAllowlist** setting to include your on-premises Active Directory forest information: [AuthNegotiateDelegateAllowlist](/DeployEdge/microsoft-edge-policies#authnegotiatedelegateallowlist)
    - Configure the **AuthServerAllowlist** setting to include your on-premises Active Directory forest information: [AuthServerAllowlist](/DeployEdge/microsoft-edge-policies#authserverallowlist)
- Google Chrome
    - Configure the **AuthNegotiateDelegateAllowlist** setting to include your on-premises Active Directory forest information: [AuthNegotiateDelegateAllowlist](https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/#AuthNegotiateDelegateAllowlist)
    - Configure the **AuthServerAllowlist** setting to include your on-premises Active Directory forest information: [AuthServerAllowlist](https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/#AuthServerAllowlist)
- Mozilla Firefox
    - Configure the Mozilla Firefox **network.negotiate-auth.trusted-uris** and **network.automatic-ntlm-auth.trusted-uris** settings to enable Kerberos SSO support

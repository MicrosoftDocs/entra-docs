# Multifactor Authentication Gaps workbook

The Multifactor Authentication Gaps workbook helps with identifying user sign-ins and applications that aren't protected by multifactor authentication (MFA) requirements. This workbook:
* Identifies user sign-ins not protected by MFA requirements.
* Provides further drill down options using various pivots such as applications, operating systems, and location.
* Provides several filters such as trusted locations and device states to narrow down the users/applications. 
* Provides filters to scope the workbook for a subset of users and applications.

This article gives you an overview of the **Multifactor authentication caps** workbook.

# What are Microsoft Entra sign-in logs?

Microsoft Entra logs all sign-ins into a Microsoft Entra tenant, which includes your internal apps and resources. As an IT administrator, you need to know what the sign-in log details mean, so that you can interpret the log values correctly.

Reviewing sign-in errors and patterns provides valuable insight into how your users access applications and services. The sign-in logs provided by Microsoft Entra ID are a powerful type of [activity log](overview-monitoring-health.md) that you can analyze. This article describes several key aspects of the sign-in logs.

Two other activity logs are also available to help monitor the health of your tenant:

- **[Audit](concept-audit-logs.md)** – Information about changes applied to your tenant, such as users and group management or updates applied to your tenant’s resources.
- **[Provisioning](concept-provisioning-logs.md)** – Activities performed by a provisioning service, such as the creation of a group in ServiceNow or a user imported from Workday.

## What can you do with sign-in logs?

You can use the sign-in logs to answer questions such as:

- How many users signed into a particular application this week?
- How many failed sign-in attempts occurred in the last 24 hours?
- Are users signing in from specific browsers or operating systems?
- Which of my Azure resources were accessed by managed identities and service principals?

You can also describe the activity associated with a sign-in request by identifying the following details:

- **Who** – The identity (User) performing the sign-in.
- **How** – The client (Application) used for the sign-in.  
- **What** – The target (Resource) accessed by the identity.

## How do you access the sign-in logs?

There are several ways to access the logs, depending on your needs. For more information, see [How to access activity logs](howto-access-activity-logs.md).

To view the sign-in logs from the Microsoft Entra admin center:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Reports Reader](../role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#reports-reader).
1. Browse to **Identity**> **Monitoring & health** > **Sign-in logs**.

To more effectively use the sign-in logs in the Microsoft Entra admin center, adjust the filters to only view a specific set of logs. For more information, see [Filter sign-in logs](howto-customize-filter-logs.md).

## What are the types of sign-in logs?

There are four types of logs in the sign-in logs preview:

- [Interactive user sign-ins](concept-interactive-sign-ins.md)
- [Non-interactive user sign-ins](concept-noninteractive-sign-ins.md)
- [Service principal sign-ins](concept-service-principal-sign-ins.md)
- [Managed identity sign-ins](concept-managed-identity-sign-ins.md)

The classic sign-in logs only include interactive user sign-ins.

> [!NOTE]
> Entries in the sign-in logs are system generated and can't be changed or deleted.

## Sign-in data used by other services

Sign-in data is used by several services in Azure and Microsoft Entra to monitor risky sign-ins, provide insight into application usage, and more. 

### Microsoft Entra ID Protection

Sign-in log data visualization that relates to risky sign-ins is available in the **Microsoft Entra ID Protection** overview, which uses the following data:

- Risky users
- Risky user sign-ins
- Risky workload identities

For more information about the Microsoft Entra ID Protection tools, see the [Microsoft Entra ID Protection overview](../../id-protection/overview-identity-protection.md).

### Microsoft Entra Usage and insights

To view application-specific sign-in data, browse to **Microsoft Entra ID** > **Monitoring & health** > **Usage & insights**. These reports provide a closer look at sign-ins for Microsoft Entra application activity and AD FS application activity. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra Usage & insights](concept-usage-insights-report.md).

:::image type="content" source="media/concept-sign-ins/usage-insights.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Usage & insights report." lightbox="media/concept-sign-ins/usage-insights-expanded.png":::

There are several reports available in **Usage & insights**. Some of these reports are in preview.

- Microsoft Entra application activity (preview)
- AD FS application activity
- Authentication methods activity
- Service principal sign-in activity
- Application credential activity

### Microsoft 365 activity logs

You can view Microsoft 365 activity logs from the [Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/admin-overview/admin-center-overview). Microsoft 365 activity and Microsoft Entra activity logs share a significant number of directory resources. Only the Microsoft 365 admin center provides a full view of the Microsoft 365 activity logs.

You can access the Microsoft 365 activity logs programmatically by using the [Office 365 Management APIs](/office/office-365-management-api/office-365-management-apis-overview).

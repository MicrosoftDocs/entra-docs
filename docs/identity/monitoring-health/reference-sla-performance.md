## How is SLA measured for Microsoft Entra ID?

Details on how downtime is defined and how uptime percentage is calculated are provided in the [SLA for Microsoft Entra ID](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/active-directory/v1_1/).

Performance is measured in a way that reflects customer authentication experience, rather than simply reporting on whether the system is available to outside connections. This distinction means that the calculation is based on if:

- Users can authenticate
- Microsoft Entra ID successfully issues tokens for target apps after authentication

## No planned downtime

You rely on Microsoft Entra ID to provide identity and access management for your vital systems. To ensure Microsoft Entra ID is available when business operations require it, Microsoft doesn't plan downtime for Microsoft Entra system maintenance. Instead, maintenance is performed as the service runs, without customer impact.

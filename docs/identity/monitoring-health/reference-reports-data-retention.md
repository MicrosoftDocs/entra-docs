# Microsoft Entra data retention

In this article, you learn about the data retention policies for the different activity reports in Microsoft Entra ID.

<a name='when-does-azure-ad-start-collecting-data'></a>

## When does Microsoft Entra ID start collecting data?

| Microsoft Entra Edition | Collection Start |
| :--              | :--   |
| Microsoft Entra ID P1 <br /> Microsoft Entra ID P2 <br /> Microsoft Entra Workload ID Premium | When you sign up for a subscription |
| Microsoft Entra ID Free| The first time you open [Microsoft Entra ID](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview) or use the [reporting APIs](./overview-monitoring-health.md)  |

If you already have activities data with your free license, then you can see it immediately on upgrade. If you donâ€™t have any data, then it will take up to three days for the data to show up in the reports after you upgrade to a premium license.

- For security signals, the collection process starts when you opt in to use the **Identity Protection Center**.
- For Microsoft Graph activity logs, the collection process starts when the [log category is enabled in diagnostic settings](howto-integrate-activity-logs-with-azure-monitor-logs.yml#send-logs-to-azure-monitor).

## How long does Microsoft Entra ID store the data?

Log storage within Microsoft Entra varies by report type and license type. You can retain the audit and sign-in activity data for longer than the default retention period outlined in the previous table by routing it to an Azure storage account using Azure Monitor. For more information, see [Archive Microsoft Entra logs to an Azure storage account](./howto-archive-logs-to-storage-account.md).

### Activity reports

| Report | Microsoft Entra ID Free | Microsoft Entra ID P1 | Microsoft Entra ID P2 |
| :-- | :--  | :-- | :-- |
| Audit logs | Seven days | 30 days | 30 days |
| Sign-ins | Seven days | 30 days | 30 days |
| Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication usage | 30 days | 30 days | 30 days |
| Microsoft Graph activity logs* | NA | Must be integrated with storage or analytics tools | Must be integrated with storage or analytics tools |

*Microsoft Graph activity logs are only available for Microsoft Entra ID P1 and P2 licenses. Data isn't retained unless it's archived to a storage account or integrated with analytics tools.

### Security signals

| Report         | Microsoft Entra ID Free | Microsoft Entra ID P1 | Microsoft Entra ID P2 |
| :--            | :--           | :--                 | :--                 |
| Risky users    | No limit      | No limit            | No limit            |
| Risky sign-ins | 7 days        | 30 days             | 90 days             |

> [!NOTE]
> Risky users and workload identities are not deleted until the risk has been remediated.

## Can I see last month's data after getting a premium license?

**No**, you can't. Azure stores up to seven days of activity data for a free version. When you switch from a free to a premium version, you can only see up to 7 days of data.

# Application registration permissions for custom roles in Microsoft Entra ID

This article contains the currently available app registration permissions for custom role definitions in Microsoft Entra ID.

## License requirements

[!INCLUDE [License requirement for using custom roles in Azure AD](~/includes/entra-p1-license.md)]

## Permissions for managing single-tenant applications

When choosing the permissions for your custom role, you have the option to grant access to manage only single-tenant applications. single-tenant applications are available only to users in the Microsoft Entra organization where the application is registered. single-tenant applications are defined as having **Supported account types** set to "Accounts in this organizational directory only." In the Graph API, single-tenant applications have the signInAudience property set to "AzureADMyOrg."

To grant access to manage only single-tenant applications, use the permissions below with the subtype **applications.myOrganization**. For example, microsoft.directory/applications.myOrganization/basic/update.

See the [custom roles overview](custom-overview.md) for an explanation of what the general terms subtype, permission, and property set mean. The following information is specific to application registrations.

## Create and delete

There are two permissions available for granting the ability to create application registrations, each with different behavior:

#### microsoft.directory/applications/createAsOwner

Assigning this permission results in the creator being added as the first owner of the created app registration, and the created app registration will count against the creator's 250 created objects quota.

#### microsoft.directory/applications/create

Assigning this permission results in the creator not being added as the first owner of the created app registration, and the created app registration will not count against the creator's 250 created objects quota. Use this permission carefully, because there is nothing preventing the assignee from creating app registrations until the directory-level quota is hit.

If both permissions are assigned, the /create permission will take precedence. Though the /createAsOwner permission does not automatically add the creator as the first owner, owners can be specified during the creation of the app registration when using Graph APIs or PowerShell cmdlets.

Create permissions grant access to the **New registration** command.

There are two permissions available for granting the ability to delete app registrations:

#### microsoft.directory/applications/delete

Grants the ability to delete app registrations regardless of subtype; that is, both single-tenant and multi-tenant applications.

#### microsoft.directory/applications.myOrganization/delete

Grants the ability to delete app registrations restricted to those that are accessible only to accounts in your organization or single-tenant applications (myOrganization subtype).

> [!NOTE]
> When assigning a role that contains create permissions, the role assignment must be made at the directory scope. A create permission assigned at a resource scope does not grant the ability to create app registrations.

## Read

All member users in the organization can read app registration information by default. However, guest users and application service principals can't. If you plan to assign a role to a guest user or application, you must include the appropriate read permissions.

#### microsoft.directory/applications/allProperties/read

Ability to read all properties of single-tenant and multi-tenant applications outside of properties that cannot be read in any situation like credentials.

#### microsoft.directory/applications.myOrganization/allProperties/read

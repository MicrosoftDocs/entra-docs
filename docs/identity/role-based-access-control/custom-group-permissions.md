# Group management permissions for Microsoft Entra custom roles

Group management permissions can be used in custom role definitions in Microsoft Entra ID to grant fine-grained access such as the following:

- Manage group properties like name and description
- Manage members and owners
- Create or delete groups
- Read audit logs
- Manage a specific type of group

This article lists the permissions you can use in your custom roles for different group management scenarios. For information about how to create custom roles, see [Create and assign a custom role in Microsoft Entra ID](custom-create.yml).

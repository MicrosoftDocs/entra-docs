# List Microsoft Entra role assignments for a user

A role can be assigned to a user directly or transitively via a group. This article describes how to list the Microsoft Entra roles assigned to a user. For information about assigning roles to groups, see [Use Microsoft Entra groups to manage role assignments](groups-concept.md).

## Prerequisites

- AzureADPreview module when using PowerShell
- Microsoft Graph module when using PowerShell
- Admin consent when using Graph Explorer for Microsoft Graph API

For more information, see [Prerequisites to use PowerShell or Graph Explorer](prerequisites.md).

## Microsoft Entra admin center

[!INCLUDE [portal updates](~/includes/portal-update.md)]

Follow these steps to list Microsoft Entra roles for a user using the Microsoft Entra admin center. Your experience will be different depending on whether you have [Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management (PIM)](~/id-governance/privileged-identity-management/pim-configure.md) enabled.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com).

1. Browse to **Identity** > **Users** > **All users**.

1. Select *user name* > **Assigned roles**.

    You can see the list of roles assigned to the user at different scopes. Additionally, you can see whether the role has been assigned directly or via a group.

    If you have a Premium P2 license, you'll see the PIM experience, which has eligible, active, and expired role assignment details.

## PowerShell

Follow these steps to list Microsoft Entra roles assigned to a user using PowerShell.

1. Install Microsoft Graph module using [Install-module](/powershell/azure/active-directory/install-adv2).
  
    ```powershell
    Install-module -name Microsoft.Graph
    ```

3. In a PowerShell window, use [Connect-MgGraph](/powershell/microsoftgraph/get-started) to sign into and use Microsoft Graph PowerShell cmdlets.
  
      ```powershell
      Connect-MgGraph
      ```

4. Use the [List transitiveRoleAssignments](/graph/api/rbacapplication-list-transitiveroleassignments) API to get roles assigned directly and transitively to a user.

      ```powershell
      $response = $null
      $uri = "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/roleManagement/directory/transitiveRoleAssignments?`$count=true&`$filter=principalId eq 'aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-1111-222222222222'"
      $method = 'GET'
      $headers = @{'ConsistencyLevel' = 'eventual'}
      
      $response = (Invoke-MgGraphRequest -Uri $uri -Headers $headers -Method $method -Body $null).value
      ```

## Microsoft Graph API

Follow these steps to list Microsoft Entra roles assigned to a user using the Microsoft Graph API in [Graph Explorer](https://aka.ms/ge).

1. Sign in to the [Graph Explorer](https://aka.ms/ge).

1. Use the [List transitiveRoleAssignments](/graph/api/rbacapplication-list-transitiveroleassignments) API to get roles assigned directly and transitively to a user. Add following query to the URL.

   ```http
   GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/rolemanagement/directory/transitiveRoleAssignments?$count=true&$filter=principalId eq 'aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-1111-222222222222'
   ```
  
3. Navigate to **Request headers** tab. Add `ConsistencyLevel` as key and `Eventual` as its value. 

5. Select **Run query**.

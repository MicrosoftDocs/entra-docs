[![Privileged label icon.](/media/permissions-reference/privileged-label.png)](privileged-roles-permissions.md)

This is a [privileged role](../privileged-roles-permissions.md). Users in this role can read settings and administrative information across Microsoft 365 services but can't take management actions. Global Reader is the read-only counterpart to Global Administrator. Assign Global Reader instead of Global Administrator for planning, audits, or investigations. Use Global Reader in combination with other limited admin roles like Exchange Administrator to make it easier to get work done without the assigning the Global Administrator role. Global Reader works with Microsoft 365 admin center, Exchange admin center, SharePoint admin center, Teams admin center, Microsoft 365 Defender portal, Microsoft Purview compliance portal, Azure portal, and Device Management admin center.

Users with this role **cannot** do the following:

- Cannot access the Purchase Services area in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

- View usage reports for Virtual Visits in the Teams admin center, Microsoft 365 admin center, Fabric, and Power BI
- View features and settings in the Microsoft 365 admin center, but can't edit any settings

Virtual Visits are a simple way to schedule and manage online and video appointments for staff and attendees. For example, usage reporting can show how sending SMS text messages before appointments can reduce the number of people who don't show up for appointments.

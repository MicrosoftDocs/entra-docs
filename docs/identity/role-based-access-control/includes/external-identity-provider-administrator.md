## External Identity Provider Administrator

[![Privileged label icon.](../media/permissions-reference/privileged-label.png)](../privileged-roles-permissions.md)

This is a [privileged role](../privileged-roles-permissions.md). This administrator manages federation between Microsoft Entra organizations and external identity providers. With this role, users can add new identity providers and configure all available settings (e.g. authentication path, service ID, assigned key containers). This user can enable the Microsoft Entra organization to trust authentications from external identity providers. The resulting impact on end-user experiences depends on the type of organization:

* Microsoft Entra organizations for employees and partners: The addition of a federation (e.g. with Gmail) will immediately impact all guest invitations not yet redeemed. See [Adding Google as an identity provider for B2B guest users](~/external-id/google-federation.md).
* Azure Active Directory B2C organizations: The addition of a federation (for example, with Facebook, or with another Microsoft Entra organization) does not immediately impact end-user flows until the identity provider is added as an option in a user flow (also called a built-in policy). See [Configuring a Microsoft account as an identity provider](/azure/active-directory-b2c/identity-provider-microsoft-account) for an example. To change user flows, the limited role of "B2C User Flow Administrator" is required.

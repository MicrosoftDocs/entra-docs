[![Privileged label icon.](../media/permissions-reference/privileged-label.png)](../privileged-roles-permissions.md)

This is a [privileged role](../privileged-roles-permissions.md). Users assigned to this role can create and manage policy keys and secrets used for token encryption, token signing, and claim encryption/decryption. They can add new keys to existing key containers, enabling secret rollover without affecting existing applications. Additionally, users in this role can view the complete details of these secrets, including their expiration dates, even after creation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a sensitive role.Â The keyset administrator role should be carefully audited and assigned with care during preproduction and production.

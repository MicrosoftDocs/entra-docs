This is a [privileged role](../privileged-roles-permissions.md). Users with this role can manage role assignments in Microsoft Entra ID, as well as within Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management. They can create and manage groups that can be assigned to Microsoft Entra roles. In addition, this role allows management of all aspects of Privileged Identity Management and administrative units.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This role grants the ability to manage assignments for all Microsoft Entra roles including the Global Administrator role. This role does not include any other privileged abilities in Microsoft Entra ID like creating or updating users. However, users assigned to this role can grant themselves or others additional privilege by assigning additional roles.

[![Privileged label icon.](../media/permissions-reference/privileged-label.png)](../privileged-roles-permissions.md)

This is a [privileged role](../privileged-roles-permissions.md). Users in this role can create and manage all aspects of enterprise applications, application registrations, and application proxy settings. Note that users assigned to this role are not added as owners when creating new application registrations or enterprise applications.

This role also grants the ability to consent for delegated permissions and application permissions, with the exception of application permissions for Azure AD Graph and Microsoft Graph.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This exception means that you can still consent to application permissions for _other_ apps (for example, other Microsoft apps, 3rd-party apps, or apps that you have registered). You can still _request_ these permissions as part of the app registration, but _granting_ (that is, consenting to) these permissions requires a more privileged administrator, such as Privileged Role Administrator.
>
>This role grants the ability to manage application credentials. Users assigned this role can add credentials to an application, and use those credentials to impersonate the application's identity. If the application's identity has been granted access to a resource, such as the ability to create or update User or other objects, then a user assigned to this role could perform those actions while impersonating the application. This ability to impersonate the application's identity may be an elevation of privilege over what the user can do via their role assignments. It is important to understand that assigning a user to the Application Administrator role gives them the ability to impersonate an application's identity.

[![Privileged label icon.](../media/permissions-reference/privileged-label.png)](../privileged-roles-permissions.md)

This is a [privileged role](../privileged-roles-permissions.md). Assign the Authentication Administrator role to users who need to do the following:

- Set or reset any authentication method (including passwords) for nonadministrators and some roles. For a list of the roles that an Authentication Administrator can read or update authentication methods, see [Who can reset passwords](../privileged-roles-permissions.md#who-can-reset-passwords).
- Require users who are nonadministrators or assigned to some roles to re-register against existing nonpassword credentials (for example, MFA or FIDO), and can also revoke **remember MFA on the device**, which prompts for MFA on the next sign-in.
- Manage MFA settings in the legacy MFA management portal.
- Perform sensitive actions for some users. For more information, see [Who can perform sensitive actions](../privileged-roles-permissions.md#who-can-perform-sensitive-actions).
- Create and manage support tickets in Azure and the Microsoft 365 admin center.

Users with this role **cannot** do the following:

- Cannot change the credentials or reset MFA for members and owners of a [role-assignable group](../groups-concept.md).
- Cannot manage Hardware OATH tokens.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Users with this role can change credentials for people who may have access to sensitive or private information or critical configuration inside and outside of Microsoft Entra ID. Changing the credentials of a user may mean the ability to assume that user's identity and permissions. For example:
>
>* Application Registration and Enterprise Application owners, who can manage credentials of apps they own. Those apps may have privileged permissions in Microsoft Entra ID and elsewhere not granted to Authentication Administrators. Through this path, an Authentication Administrator can assume the identity of an application owner and then further assume the identity of a privileged application by updating the credentials for the application.
>* Azure subscription owners, who may have access to sensitive or private information or critical configuration in Azure.
>* Security Group and Microsoft 365 group owners, who can manage group membership. Those groups may grant access to sensitive or private information or critical configuration in Microsoft Entra ID and elsewhere.
>* Administrators in other services outside of Microsoft Entra ID like Exchange Online, Microsoft Defender XDR portal, Microsoft Purview portal, and human resources systems.
>* Nonadministrators like executives, legal counsel, and human resources employees who may have access to sensitive or private information.

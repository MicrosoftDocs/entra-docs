| Permission | More information |
| --- | --- |
| Create users |  |
| Update most user properties for all users, including all administrators | [Who can perform sensitive actions](privileged-roles-permissions.md#who-can-perform-sensitive-actions) |
| Update sensitive properties (including user principal name) for some users | [Who can perform sensitive actions](privileged-roles-permissions.md#who-can-perform-sensitive-actions) |
| Disable or enable some users | [Who can perform sensitive actions](privileged-roles-permissions.md#who-can-perform-sensitive-actions) |

| Create and manage user views |  |
| Create and manage all groups |  |
| Assign and read licenses for all users, including all administrators |  |
| Reset passwords | [Who can reset passwords](privileged-roles-permissions.md#who-can-reset-passwords) |

| Update (FIDO) device keys |  |
| Update password expiration policies |  |
| Create and manage support tickets in Azure and the Microsoft 365 admin center |  |

Users with this role **cannot** do the following:

- Cannot manage MFA.
- Cannot change the credentials or reset MFA for members and owners of a [role-assignable group](groups-concept.md).
- Cannot manage shared mailboxes.
- Cannot modify security questions for password reset operation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Users with this role can change passwords for people who may have access to sensitive or private information or critical configuration inside and outside of Microsoft Entra ID. Changing the password of a user may mean the ability to assume that user's identity and permissions. For example:
>
>- Application Registration and Enterprise Application owners, who can manage credentials of apps they own. Those apps may have privileged permissions in Microsoft Entra ID and elsewhere not granted to User Administrators. Through this path a User Administrator may be able to assume the identity of an application owner and then further assume the identity of a privileged application by updating the credentials for the application.
>- Azure subscription owners, who may have access to sensitive or private information or critical configuration in Azure.
>- Security Group and Microsoft 365 group owners, who can manage group membership. Those groups may grant access to sensitive or private information or critical configuration in Microsoft Entra ID and elsewhere.
>- Administrators in other services outside of Microsoft Entra ID like Exchange Online, Microsoft 365 Defender portal, Microsoft Purview compliance portal, and human resources systems.
>- Non-administrators like executives, legal counsel, and human resources employees who may have access to sensitive or private information.

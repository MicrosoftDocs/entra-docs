Users with this role can create and manage user flows (also called "built-in" policies) in the Azure portal. These users can customize HTML/CSS/JavaScript content, change MFA requirements, select claims in the token, manage API connectors and their credentials, and configure session settings for all user flows in the Microsoft Entra organization. On the other hand, this role does not include the ability to review user data or make changes to the attributes that are included in the organization schema. Changes to Identity Experience Framework policies (also known as custom policies) are also outside the scope of this role.

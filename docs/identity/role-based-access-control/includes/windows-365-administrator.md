Users with this role have global permissions on Windows 365 resources, when the service is present. Additionally, this role contains the ability to manage users and devices in order to associate policy, as well as create and manage groups.

This role can create and manage security groups, but does not have administrator rights over Microsoft 365 groups. That means administrators cannot update owners or memberships of Microsoft 365 groups in the organization. However, they can manage the Microsoft 365 group they create, which is a part of their end-user privileges. So, any Microsoft 365 group (not security group) they create is counted against their quota of 250.

Assign the Windows 365 Administrator role to users who need to do the following tasks:

- Manage Windows 365 Cloud PCs in Microsoft Intune
- Enroll and manage devices in Microsoft Entra ID, including assigning users and policies
- Create and manage security groups, but not role-assignable groups
- View basic properties in the Microsoft 365 admin center
- Read usage reports in the Microsoft 365 admin center
- Create and manage support tickets in Azure and the Microsoft 365 admin center

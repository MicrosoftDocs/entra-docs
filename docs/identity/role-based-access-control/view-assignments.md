# List Microsoft Entra role assignments

This article describes how to list roles you have assigned in Microsoft Entra ID. In Microsoft Entra ID, roles can be assigned at an organization-wide scope or with a single-application scope.

- Role assignments at the organization-wide scope are added to and can be seen in the list of single application role assignments.
- Role assignments at the single application scope aren't added to and can't be seen in the list of organization-wide scoped assignments.

## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Graph PowerShell module when using PowerShell
- Admin consent when using Graph explorer for Microsoft Graph API

For more information, see [Prerequisites to use PowerShell or Graph Explorer](prerequisites.md).

## Microsoft Entra admin center

[!INCLUDE [portal updates](~/includes/portal-update.md)]

### List role assignments with single-application scope

This section describes how to list role assignments with single-application scope. This feature is currently in public preview.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com).

1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **App registrations**.

1. Select the app registration to view its properties. You might have to select **All applications** to see the complete list of app registrations in your Microsoft Entra organization.

    ![Create or edit app registrations from the App registrations page](./media/view-assignments/app-reg-all-apps.png)

1. In the app registration, select **Roles and administrators**, and then select a role to view its properties.

    ![List app registration role assignments from the App registrations page](./media/view-assignments/app-reg-assignments.png)

## PowerShell

This section describes viewing assignments of a role with organization-wide scope. This article uses the [Microsoft Graph PowerShell](/powershell/microsoftgraph/overview) module. To view single-application scope assignments using PowerShell, you can use the cmdlets in [Assign custom roles with PowerShell](custom-assign-powershell.md).

Use the [Get-MgRoleManagementDirectoryRoleDefinition](/powershell/module/microsoft.graph.identity.governance/get-mgrolemanagementdirectoryroledefinition) and [Get-MgRoleManagementDirectoryRoleAssignment](/powershell/module/microsoft.graph.identity.governance/get-mgrolemanagementdirectoryroleassignment) commands to list role assignments.

The following example shows how to list the role assignments for the [Groups Administrator](permissions-reference.md#groups-administrator) role.

```powershell
# Fetch list of all directory roles with template ID
Get-MgRoleManagementDirectoryRoleDefinition

# Fetch a specific directory role by ID
$role = Get-MgRoleManagementDirectoryRoleDefinition -UnifiedRoleDefinitionId fdd7a751-b60b-444a-984c-02652fe8fa1c

# Fetch membership for a role
Get-MgRoleManagementDirectoryRoleAssignment -Filter "roleDefinitionId eq '$($role.Id)'"
```

```Example
Id                                            PrincipalId                          RoleDefinitionId                     DirectoryScopeId AppScop
                                                                                                                                         eId
--                                            -----------                          ----------------                     ---------------- -------

```

The following example shows how to list all active role assignments across all roles, including built-in and custom roles (currently in Preview).

```powershell
$roles = Get-MgRoleManagementDirectoryRoleDefinition
foreach ($role in $roles)
{
  Get-MgRoleManagementDirectoryRoleAssignment -Filter "roleDefinitionId eq '$($role.Id)'"
}
```

```Example
Id                                            PrincipalId                          RoleDefinitionId                     DirectoryScopeId AppScop
                                                                                                                                         eId

## Microsoft Graph API

This section describes how to list role assignments with organization-wide scope. To list single-application scope role assignments using Graph API, you can use the operations in [Assign custom roles with Graph API](custom-assign-graph.md).

Use the [List unifiedRoleAssignments](/graph/api/rbacapplication-list-roleassignments) API to get the role assignments for a specific role definition. The following example shows how to list the role assignments for a specific role definition with the ID `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`.

```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/roleManagement/directory/roleAssignments?$filter=roleDefinitionId eq ‘<template-id-of-role-definition>’
```

Response

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
{
    "id": "C2dE3fH4iJ5kL6mN7oP8qR9sT0uV1wIiSDKQoTVJrLE9etXyrY0-1",
    "principalId": "aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-1111-222222222222",
    "roleDefinitionId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
    "directoryScopeId": "/"
}
```

# Microsoft Entra built-in roles

In Microsoft Entra ID, if another administrator or non-administrator needs to manage Microsoft Entra resources, you assign them a Microsoft Entra role that provides the permissions they need. For example, you can assign roles to allow adding or changing users, resetting user passwords, managing user licenses, or managing domain names.

This article lists the Microsoft Entra built-in roles you can assign to allow management of Microsoft Entra resources. For information about how to assign roles, see [Assign Microsoft Entra roles to users](manage-roles-portal.yml). If you are looking for roles to manage Azure resources, see [Azure built-in roles](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles).

## Application Administrator

[![Privileged label icon.](./media/permissions-reference/privileged-label.png)](privileged-roles-permissions.md)

This is a [privileged role](privileged-roles-permissions.md). Users in this role can create and manage all aspects of enterprise applications, application registrations, and application proxy settings. Note that users assigned to this role are not added as owners when creating new application registrations or enterprise applications.

This role also grants the ability to consent for delegated permissions and application permissions, with the exception of application permissions for Azure AD Graph and Microsoft Graph.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This exception means that you can still consent to application permissions for _other_ apps (for example, other Microsoft apps, 3rd-party apps, or apps that you have registered). You can still _request_ these permissions as part of the app registration, but _granting_ (that is, consenting to) these permissions requires a more privileged administrator, such as Global Administrator.
>
>This role grants the ability to manage application credentials. Users assigned this role can add credentials to an application, and use those credentials to impersonate the application’s identity. If the application’s identity has been granted access to a resource, such as the ability to create or update User or other objects, then a user assigned to this role could perform those actions while impersonating the application. This ability to impersonate the application’s identity may be an elevation of privilege over what the user can do via their role assignments. It is important to understand that assigning a user to the Application Administrator role gives them the ability to impersonate an application’s identity.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Users with this role can change credentials for people who may have access to sensitive or private information or critical configuration inside and outside of Microsoft Entra ID. Changing the credentials of a user may mean the ability to assume that user's identity and permissions. For example:
>
>* Application Registration and Enterprise Application owners, who can manage credentials of apps they own. Those apps may have privileged permissions in Microsoft Entra ID and elsewhere not granted to Authentication Administrators. Through this path an Authentication Administrator can assume the identity of an application owner and then further assume the identity of a privileged application by updating the credentials for the application.
>* Azure subscription owners, who may have access to sensitive or private information or critical configuration in Azure.
>* Security Group and Microsoft 365 group owners, who can manage group membership. Those groups may grant access to sensitive or private information or critical configuration in Microsoft Entra ID and elsewhere.
>* Administrators in other services outside of Microsoft Entra ID like Exchange Online, Microsoft 365 Defender portal, Microsoft Purview compliance portal, and human resources systems.
>* Non-administrators like executives, legal counsel, and human resources employees who may have access to sensitive or private information.

This role grants the ability to create and manage all aspects of enterprise applications and application registrations. Users assigned to this role are not added as owners when creating new application registrations or enterprise applications.

This role also grants the ability to consent for delegated permissions and application permissions, with the exception of application permissions for Azure AD Graph and Microsoft Graph.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This exception means that you can still consent to application permissions for _other_ apps (for example, other Microsoft apps, 3rd-party apps, or apps that you have registered). You can still _request_ these permissions as part of the app registration, but _granting_ (that is, consenting to) these permissions requires a more privileged administrator, such as Global Administrator.
>
>This role grants the ability to manage application credentials. Users assigned this role can add credentials to an application, and use those credentials to impersonate the application’s identity. If the application’s identity has been granted access to a resource, such as the ability to create or update User or other objects, then a user assigned to this role could perform those actions while impersonating the application. This ability to impersonate the application’s identity may be an elevation of privilege over what the user can do via their role assignments. It is important to understand that assigning a user to the Application Administrator role gives them the ability to impersonate an application’s identity.

## Domain Name Administrator

[![Privileged label icon.](./media/permissions-reference/privileged-label.png)](privileged-roles-permissions.md)

This is a [privileged role](privileged-roles-permissions.md). Users with this role can manage (read, add, verify, update, and delete) domain names. They can also read directory information about users, groups, and applications, as these objects possess domain dependencies. For on-premises environments, users with this role can configure domain names for federation so that associated users are always authenticated on-premises. These users can then sign into Microsoft Entra based services with their on-premises passwords via single sign-on. Federation settings need to be synced via Microsoft Entra Connect, so users also have permissions to manage Microsoft Entra Connect.

## External Identity Provider Administrator

[![Privileged label icon.](./media/permissions-reference/privileged-label.png)](privileged-roles-permissions.md)

This is a [privileged role](privileged-roles-permissions.md). This administrator manages federation between Microsoft Entra organizations and external identity providers. With this role, users can add new identity providers and configure all available settings (e.g. authentication path, service ID, assigned key containers). This user can enable the Microsoft Entra organization to trust authentications from external identity providers. The resulting impact on end-user experiences depends on the type of organization:

* Microsoft Entra organizations for employees and partners: The addition of a federation (e.g. with Gmail) will immediately impact all guest invitations not yet redeemed. See [Adding Google as an identity provider for B2B guest users](~/external-id/google-federation.md).
* Azure Active Directory B2C organizations: The addition of a federation (for example, with Facebook, or with another Microsoft Entra organization) does not immediately impact end-user flows until the identity provider is added as an option in a user flow (also called a built-in policy). See [Configuring a Microsoft account as an identity provider](/azure/active-directory-b2c/identity-provider-microsoft-account) for an example. To change user flows, the limited role of "B2C User Flow Administrator" is required.

## Global Administrator

[![Privileged label icon.](./media/permissions-reference/privileged-label.png)](privileged-roles-permissions.md)

This is a [privileged role](privileged-roles-permissions.md). Users with this role have access to all administrative features in Microsoft Entra ID, as well as services that use Microsoft Entra identities like the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, the Microsoft Purview compliance portal, Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and Skype for Business Online. Global Administrators can view Directory Activity logs. Furthermore, Global Administrators can [elevate their access](/azure/role-based-access-control/elevate-access-global-admin) to manage all Azure subscriptions and management groups. This allows Global Administrators to get full access to all Azure resources using the respective Microsoft Entra tenant. The person who signs up for the Microsoft Entra organization becomes a Global Administrator. There can be more than one Global Administrator at your company. Global Administrators can reset the password for any user and all other administrators. A Global Administrator cannot remove their own Global Administrator assignment. This is to prevent a situation where an organization has zero Global Administrators.

> [!NOTE]
> As a best practice, Microsoft recommends that you assign the Global Administrator role to fewer than five people in your organization. For more information, see [Best practices for Microsoft Entra roles](best-practices.md).

## Helpdesk Administrator

[![Privileged label icon.](./media/permissions-reference/privileged-label.png)](privileged-roles-permissions.md)

This is a [privileged role](privileged-roles-permissions.md). Users with this role can change passwords, invalidate refresh tokens, create and manage support requests with Microsoft for Azure and Microsoft 365 services, and monitor service health. Invalidating a refresh token forces the user to sign in again. Whether a Helpdesk Administrator can reset a user's password and invalidate refresh tokens depends on the role the user is assigned. For a list of the roles that a Helpdesk Administrator can reset passwords for and invalidate refresh tokens, see [Who can reset passwords](privileged-roles-permissions.md#who-can-reset-passwords).

Users with this role **cannot** do the following:

- Cannot change the credentials or reset MFA for members and owners of a [role-assignable group](groups-concept.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Users with this role can change passwords for people who may have access to sensitive or private information or critical configuration inside and outside of Microsoft Entra ID. Changing the password of a user may mean the ability to assume that user's identity and permissions. For example:
>
>- Application Registration and Enterprise Application owners, who can manage credentials of apps they own. Those apps may have privileged permissions in Microsoft Entra ID and elsewhere not granted to Helpdesk Administrators. Through this path a Helpdesk Administrator may be able to assume the identity of an application owner and then further assume the identity of a privileged application by updating the credentials for the application.
>- Azure subscription owners, who might have access to sensitive or private information or critical configuration in Azure.
>- Security Group and Microsoft 365 group owners, who can manage group membership. Those groups may grant access to sensitive or private information or critical configuration in Microsoft Entra ID and elsewhere.

## Modern Commerce Administrator

Do not use. This role is automatically assigned from Commerce, and is not intended or supported for any other use. See details below.

The Modern Commerce Administrator role gives certain users permission to access Microsoft 365 admin center and see the left navigation entries for **Home**, **Billing**, and **Support**. The content available in these areas is controlled by [commerce-specific roles](/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/understand-mca-roles) assigned to users to manage products that they bought for themselves or your organization. This might include tasks like paying bills, or for access to billing accounts and billing profiles.

Users with the Modern Commerce Administrator role typically have administrative permissions in other Microsoft purchasing systems, but do not have Global Administrator or Billing Administrator roles used to access the admin center.

**When is the Modern Commerce Administrator role assigned?**

* **Self-service purchase in Microsoft 365 admin center** – Self-service purchase gives users a chance to try out new products by buying or signing up for them on their own. These products are managed in the admin center. Users who make a self-service purchase are assigned a role in the commerce system, and the Modern Commerce Administrator role so they can manage their purchases in admin center. Admins can block self-service purchases (for Fabric, Power BI, Power Apps, Power automate) through [PowerShell](/microsoft-365/commerce/subscriptions/allowselfservicepurchase-powershell). For more information, see [Self-service purchase FAQ](/microsoft-365/commerce/subscriptions/self-service-purchase-faq).
* **Purchases from Microsoft commercial marketplace** – Similar to self-service purchase, when a user buys a product or service from Microsoft AppSource or Azure Marketplace, the Modern Commerce Administrator role is assigned if they don’t have the Global Administrator or Billing Administrator role. In some cases, users might be blocked from making these purchases. For more information, see [Microsoft commercial marketplace](/azure/marketplace/marketplace-faq-publisher-guide#what-could-block-a-customer-from-completing-a-purchase-).
* **Proposals from Microsoft** – A proposal is a formal offer from Microsoft for your organization to buy Microsoft products and services. When the person who is accepting the proposal doesn’t have a Global Administrator or Billing Administrator role in Microsoft Entra ID, they are assigned both a commerce-specific role to complete the proposal and the Modern Commerce Administrator role to access admin center. When they access the admin center they can only use features that are authorized by their commerce-specific role.
* **Commerce-specific roles** – Some users are assigned commerce-specific roles. If a user isn't a Global Administrator or Billing Administrator, they get the Modern Commerce Administrator role so they can access the admin center.

If the Modern Commerce Administrator role is unassigned from a user, they lose access to Microsoft 365 admin center. If they were managing any products, either for themselves or for your organization, they won’t be able to manage them. This might include assigning licenses, changing payment methods, paying bills, or other tasks for managing subscriptions.

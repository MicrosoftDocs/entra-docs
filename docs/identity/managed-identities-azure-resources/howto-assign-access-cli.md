# Assign a managed identity access to a resource using Azure CLI

[!INCLUDE [preview-notice](~/includes/entra-msi-preview-notice.md)]

Once you've configured an Azure resource with a managed identity, you can give the managed identity access to another resource, just like any security principal. This example shows you how to give an Azure virtual machine or virtual machine scale set's managed identity access to an Azure storage account using Azure CLI.

If you don't already have an Azure account, [sign up for a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before continuing.

## Prerequisites

- If you're unfamiliar with managed identities for Azure resources, see [What are managed identities for Azure resources?](overview.md). To learn about system-assigned and user-assigned managed identity types, see [Managed identity types](overview.md#managed-identity-types).

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-no-header.md](~/../docs/reusable-content/azure-cli/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-no-header.md)]

## Use Azure RBAC to assign a managed identity access to another resource

After you've enabled managed identity on an Azure resource, such as an [Azure virtual machine](qs-configure-cli-windows-vm.md) or [Azure virtual machine scale set](qs-configure-cli-windows-vmss.md): 

1. In this example, we are giving an Azure virtual machine access to a storage account. First we use [az resource list](/cli/azure/resource#az-resource-list) to get the service principal for the virtual machine named myVM:

   ```azurecli-interactive
   spID=$(az resource list -n myVM --query [*].identity.principalId --out tsv)
   ```
   For an Azure virtual machine scale set, the command is the same except here, you get the service principal for the virtual machine scale set named "DevTestVMSS":
   
   ```azurecli-interactive
   spID=$(az resource list -n DevTestVMSS --query [*].identity.principalId --out tsv)
   ```

1. Once you have the service principal ID, use [az role assignment create](/cli/azure/role/assignment#az-role-assignment-create) to give the virtual machine or virtual machine scale set "Reader" access to a storage account called "myStorageAcct":

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az role assignment create --assignee $spID --role 'Reader' --scope /subscriptions/<mySubscriptionID>/resourceGroups/<myResourceGroup>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/myStorageAcct
   ```

# Tutorial: Use a Linux VM/VMSS to access Azure resources

[!INCLUDE [preview-notice](~/includes/entra-msi-preview-notice.md)]

## Prerequisites

- An understanding of managed identities. If you're not familiar with the managed identities for Azure resources feature, see this [overview](~/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md).
- An Azure account, [sign up for a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
- *Owner* permissions at the appropriate scope (your subscription or resource group) to perform required resource creation and role management steps. If you need assistance with role assignment, see [Assign Azure roles to manage access to your Azure subscription resources](/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal).
- A Linux virtual machine (VM) that has system assigned managed identities enabled.
  - If you need to create a VM for this tutorial, see [Create a virtual machine with system-assigned identity enabled](~/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-configure-managed-identities.md).

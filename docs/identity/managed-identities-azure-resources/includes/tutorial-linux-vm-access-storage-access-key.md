## Use a Linux VM system-assigned managed identity to access Azure Storage via access key

This tutorial shows you how to use a system-assigned managed identity for a Linux virtual machine (VM) to retrieve storage account access keys. You can use a storage access key as usual when doing storage operations; for example, when using the Storage SDK. For this tutorial, you upload and download blobs using Azure CLI. 

You'll learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Grant your VM access to storage account access keys in Resource Manager 
> * Get an access token using your VM's identity, and use it to retrieve the storage access keys from Resource Manager  

## Create a storage account 

If you don't have an existing storage account before starting this tutorial, you need to create one. If you do have an existing storage account, follow these steps to grant your VM system-assigned managed identity access to the keys for your existing storage account. 

1. Select the **+/Create new service** button, located at the upper-left corner of the Azure portal.
1. Select **Storage**, then **Storage Account**, then the **Create storage account** panel appears.
1. Enter a **Name** for the storage account. Remember this name, as you'll need it later.  
1. Make sure that **Deployment model** is set to *Resource Manager*, and **Account kind** is set to *General purpose*. 
1. Ensure the **Subscription** and **Resource Group** match the ones you specified when you created your VM.
1. Select **Create** to finish creating a storage account.

## Create a blob container in the storage account

Later in the tutorial, you'll upload and download a file to the new storage account. Because files require blob storage, you need to create a blob container in which to store the file.

1. Navigate to your newly created storage account.
1. Select the **Containers** link in the left panel, under **Blob service**.
1. Select **+ Container** at the top of the page, then a **New container** panel appears.
1. Give the container a name, select an access level, then select **OK**. You'll need the name you specified later in the tutorial.

## Grant your VM's system-assigned managed identity access to use storage account access keys

Azure Storage doesn't natively support Microsoft Entra authentication.  However, you can use your VM's system-assigned managed identity to retrieve a storage SAS from Resource Manager, then use the SAS to access storage.  In this step, you grant your VM's system-assigned managed identity access to your storage account SAS. Grant access by assigning the [Storage Account Contributor](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-account-contributor) role to the managed-identity at the scope of the resource group that contains your storage account.
 
For detailed steps, see [Assign Azure roles using the Azure portal](/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal).

>[!NOTE]
> For more information on the various roles that you can use to grant permissions to storage review [Authorize access to blobs and queues using Microsoft Entra ID.](/azure/storage/blobs/authorize-access-azure-active-directory#assign-azure-roles-for-access-rights)

## Get an access token using the VM's identity and use it to call Azure Resource Manager

For the remainder of the tutorial, we work from the VM we created earlier.

To complete these steps, you need an SSH client. If you are using Windows, you can use the SSH client in the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](/windows/wsl/install). If you need assistance configuring your SSH client's keys, see [How to Use SSH keys with Windows on Azure](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/ssh-from-windows), or [How to create and use an SSH public and private key pair for Linux VMs in Azure](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/mac-create-ssh-keys).

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to **Virtual Machines**, select your Linux virtual machine, then from the **Overview** page select **Connect** at the top. Copy the string to connect to your VM. 
2. Connect to your VM using your SSH client.  
3. Next, you need to enter the **Password** you added when creating the **Linux VM**.  
4. Use CURL to get an access token for Azure Resource Manager.  

    The CURL request and response for the access token is below:
    
    ```bash
    curl 'http://169.254.169.254/metadata/identity/oauth2/token?api-version=2018-02-01&resource=https%3A%2F%2Fmanagement.azure.com%2F' -H Metadata:true
    ```
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > In the previous request, the value of the "resource" parameter must be an exact match for what is expected by Microsoft Entra ID. When using the Azure Resource Manager resource ID, you must include the trailing slash on the URI.
    > In the following response, the access_token element as been shortened for brevity.
    
    ```json
    {
      "access_token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJ...",
      "refresh_token": "",
      "expires_in": "3599",
      "expires_on": "1504130527",
      "not_before": "1504126627",
      "resource": "https://management.azure.com",
      "token_type": "Bearer"
    }
    ```

## Get storage account access keys from Azure Resource Manager to make storage calls  

Now use CURL to call Resource Manager using the access token we retrieved in the previous section, to retrieve the storage access key. Once we have the storage access key, we can call storage upload/download operations. Be sure to replace the `<SUBSCRIPTION ID>`, `<RESOURCE GROUP>`, and `<STORAGE ACCOUNT NAME>` parameter values with your own values. Replace the `<ACCESS TOKEN>` value with the access token you retrieved earlier:

```bash 
curl https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION ID>/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE GROUP>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<STORAGE ACCOUNT NAME>/listKeys?api-version=2016-12-01 --request POST -d "" -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS TOKEN>" 
```

> [!NOTE]
> The text in the prior URL is case sensitive, so ensure if you are using upper-lowercase for your Resource Groups to reflect it accordingly. Additionally, itâ€™s important to know that this is a POST request not a GET request and ensure you pass a value to capture a length limit with -d that can be NULL.  

The CURL response gives you the list of Keys:  

```bash 
{"keys":[{"keyName":"key1","permissions":"Full","value":"iqDPNt..."},{"keyName":"key2","permissions":"Full","value":"U+uI0B..."}]} 
```

Create a sample blob file to upload to your blob storage container. On a Linux VM, you can do this with the following command. 

```bash
echo "This is a test file." > test.txt
```

Next, authenticate with the CLI `az storage` command using the storage access key, and upload the file to the blob container. For this step, you need to [install the latest Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) on your VM, if you haven't already.
 

```azurecli
az storage blob upload -c <CONTAINER NAME> -n test.txt -f test.txt --account-name <STORAGE ACCOUNT NAME> --account-key <STORAGE ACCOUNT KEY>
```

Response: 

```JSON

  "etag": "\"0x8D4F9929765C139\"",
  "lastModified": "2017-09-12T03:58:56+00:00"
}
```

Additionally, you can download the file using the Azure CLI and authenticating with the storage access key. 

Request: 

```azurecli
az storage blob download -c <CONTAINER NAME> -n test.txt -f test-download.txt --account-name <STORAGE ACCOUNT NAME> --account-key <STORAGE ACCOUNT KEY>
```

Response:

## View the service principal of a managed identity using Azure CLI

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-no-header.md](~/../docs/reusable-content/azure-cli/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-no-header.md)]

The following command demonstrates how to view the service principal of a virtual machine (VM) or application with managed identity enabled. Replace `<Azure resource name>` with your own values.

```azurecli-interactive
az ad sp list --display-name <Azure resource name>
```

# Manage user-assigned managed identities using REST

[!INCLUDE [introduction-section](./includes/manage-user-assigned-identity-intro.md)]

In this article, you learn how to create, list, and delete a user-assigned managed identity by using REST.

## Prerequisites

- If you're unfamiliar with managed identities for Azure resources, check out the [overview section](overview.md). *Be sure to review the [difference between a system-assigned and user-assigned managed identity](overview.md#managed-identity-types)*.
- If you don't already have an Azure account, [sign up for a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn) before you continue.
- You can run all the commands in this article either in the cloud or locally:
    - To run in the cloud, use [Azure Cloud Shell](/azure/cloud-shell/overview).
    - To run locally, install [curl](https://curl.se/download.html) and the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Obtain a bearer access token

1. If you're running locally, sign in to Azure through the Azure CLI.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az login
    ```

1. Obtain an access token by using [az account get-access-token](/cli/azure/account#az-account-get-access-token).

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az account get-access-token
    ```

## Create a user-assigned managed identity

To create a user-assigned managed identity, your account needs the [Managed Identity Contributor](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#managed-identity-contributor) role assignment.

[!INCLUDE [ua-character-limit](~/includes/managed-identity-ua-character-limits.md)]

```bash
curl 'https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION ID>/resourceGroup
s/<RESOURCE GROUP>/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/<USER ASSIGNED IDENTITY NAME>?api-version=2015-08-31-preview' -X PUT -d '{"location": "<LOCATION>"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS TOKEN>"
```

```HTTP
PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION ID>/resourceGroup
s/<RESOURCE GROUP>/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/<USER ASSIGNED IDENTITY NAME>?api-version=2015-08-31-preview HTTP/1.1
```

**Request headers**

|Request header  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|*Content-Type*     | Required. Set to `application/json`.        |
|*Authorization*     | Required. Set to a valid `Bearer` access token.        |

**Request body**

|Name  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Location     | Required. Resource location.        |

## List user-assigned managed identities

To list or read a user-assigned managed identity, your account needs the [Managed Identity Operator](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#managed-identity-operator) or [Managed Identity Contributor](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#managed-identity-contributor) role assignment.

```bash
curl 'https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION ID>/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE GROUP>/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities?api-version=2015-08-31-preview' -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS TOKEN>"
```

```HTTP
GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION ID>/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE GROUP>/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities?api-version=2015-08-31-preview HTTP/1.1
```

|Request header  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|*Content-Type*     | Required. Set to `application/json`.        |
|*Authorization*     | Required. Set to a valid `Bearer` access token.        |

## Delete a user-assigned managed identity

To delete a user-assigned managed identity, your account needs the [Managed Identity Contributor](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#managed-identity-contributor) role assignment.

Deleting a user-assigned managed identity won't remove the reference from any resource it was assigned to.

```bash
curl 'https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION ID>/resourceGroup
s/<RESOURCE GROUP>/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/<USER ASSIGNED IDENTITY NAME>?api-version=2015-08-31-preview' -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS TOKEN>"
```

```HTTP
DELETE https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourceGroups/TestRG/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/<USER ASSIGNED IDENTITY NAME>?api-version=2015-08-31-preview HTTP/1.1
```

|Request header  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|*Content-Type*     | Required. Set to `application/json`.        |
|*Authorization*     | Required. Set to a valid `Bearer` access token.        |

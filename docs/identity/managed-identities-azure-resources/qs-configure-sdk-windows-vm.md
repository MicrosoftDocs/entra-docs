# Configure a VM with managed identities for Azure resources using an Azure SDK

[!INCLUDE [preview-notice](~/includes/entra-msi-preview-notice.md)]

Managed identities for Azure resources provide Azure services with an automatically managed identity in Microsoft Entra ID. You can use this identity to authenticate to any service that supports Microsoft Entra authentication, without having credentials in your code. 

In this article, you learn how to enable and remove managed identities for Azure resources for an Azure VM, using an Azure SDK.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [msi-qs-configure-prereqs](~/includes/entra-msi-qs-configure-prereqs.md)]

## Azure SDKs with managed identities for Azure resources support 

Azure supports multiple programming platforms through a series of [Azure SDKs](https://azure.microsoft.com/downloads). Several of them have been updated to support managed identities for Azure resources, and provide corresponding samples to demonstrate usage. This list is updated as other support is added:

| SDK | Sample |
| --- | ------ | 
| .NET   | [Manage resource from a VM enabled with managed identities for Azure resources enabled](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aad-dotnet-manage-resources-from-vm-with-msi) |
| Java   | [Manage storage from a VM enabled with managed identities for Azure resources](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/compute-java-manage-resources-from-vm-with-msi-in-aad-group)|
| Node.js| [Create a VM with system-assigned managed identity enabled](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/samples/compute-node-msi-vm/) |
| Python | [Create a VM with system-assigned managed identity enabled](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/samples/compute-python-msi-vm/) |
| Ruby   | [Create Azure VM with a system-assigned identity enabled](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/compute-ruby-msi-vm/) |

## Next steps

# View update and sign-in activities for Managed identities

This article explains how to view updates carried out to managed identities, and sign-in attempts made by managed identities.

## Prerequisites

- If you're unfamiliar with managed identities for Azure resources, check out the [overview section](overview.md).
- If you don't already have an Azure account, [sign up for a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

## View updates made to user-assigned managed identities

This procedure demonstrates how to view updates carried out to user-assigned managed identities.

1. In the Azure portal, browse to **Activity Log**.

2. Select the **Add Filter** search pill and select **Operation** from the list.

3. In the **Operation** dropdown list, enter these operation names: "Delete User Assigned Identity" and "Write UserAssignedIdentities".

## View role assignments added and removed for managed identities

 > [!NOTE] 
 > You will need to search by the object (principal) ID of the managed identity you want to view role assignment changes for

1. Locate the managed identity you wish to view the role assignment changes for. If you're looking for a system-assigned managed identity, the object ID will be displayed in the **Identity** screen under the resource. If you're looking for a user-assigned identity, the object ID will be displayed in the **Overview** page of the managed identity.

User-assigned identity:

System-assigned identity:

:::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-view-managed-identity-activity/get-object-id-of-system-assigned-identity.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to get the object ID of system-assigned identity":::

2. Copy the object ID.
3. Browse to the **Activity log**.

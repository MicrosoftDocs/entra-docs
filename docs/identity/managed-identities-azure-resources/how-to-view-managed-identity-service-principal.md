# View the service principal of a managed identity

Managed identities for Azure resources provide Azure services with an automatically managed identity in Microsoft Entra ID. You can use this identity to authenticate to any service that supports Microsoft Entra authentication without having credentials in your code. 

In this article, you'll learn how to view the service principal of a managed identity.

> [!NOTE] 
> Service principals are enterprise applications. 

## Prerequisites

- If you're unfamiliar with managed identities for Azure resources, see [What are managed identities for Azure resources?](~/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md).
- If you don't already have an Azure account, [sign up for a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before continuing.
- Enable [system assigned identity on a virtual machine](~/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/qs-configure-portal-windows-vm.md#system-assigned-managed-identity) or [application](/azure/app-service/overview-managed-identity#add-a-system-assigned-identity).

# Manage user-assigned managed identities using PowerShell

[!INCLUDE [introduction-section](./includes/manage-user-assigned-identity-intro.md)]

In this article, you learn how to create, list, delete, or assign a role to a user-assigned managed identity by using PowerShell. We use Azure Virtual Machine (AzureVM) as an example resource to which you can assign a user-assigned managed identity.

## Prerequisites

- If you're unfamiliar with managed identities for Azure resources, check out the [overview section](overview.md). *Be sure to review the [difference between a system-assigned and user-assigned managed identity](overview.md#managed-identity-types)*.
- If you don't already have an Azure account, [sign up for a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn) before you continue.
- To run the example scripts, you have two options:
    - Use [Azure Cloud Shell](/azure/cloud-shell/overview), which you can open by using the **Try It** button in the upper-right corner of code blocks.
    - Run scripts locally with Azure PowerShell, as described in the next section.

### Configure Azure PowerShell locally

To use Azure PowerShell locally for this article instead of using Cloud Shell:

1. Install [the latest version of Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell) if you haven't already.

1. Sign in to Azure.

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
    Connect-AzAccount
    ```

1. Install the [latest version of PowerShellGet](/powershell/gallery/powershellget/install-powershellget).

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
    Install-Module -Name PowerShellGet -AllowPrerelease
    ```

    You might need to `Exit` out of the current PowerShell session after you run this command for the next step.

1. Install the prerelease version of the `Az.ManagedServiceIdentity` module to perform the user-assigned managed identity operations in this article.

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
    Install-Module -Name Az.ManagedServiceIdentity -AllowPrerelease
    ```

## Create a user-assigned managed identity

To create a user-assigned managed identity, your account needs the [Managed Identity Contributor](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#managed-identity-contributor) role assignment.

1. To create a user-assigned managed identity, use the `New-AzUserAssignedIdentity` command. The `ResourceGroupName` parameter specifies the resource group where to create the user-assigned managed identity. The `-Name` parameter specifies its name.
1. Replace the `<RESOURCE GROUP>` and `<USER ASSIGNED IDENTITY NAME>` parameter values with your own values.

    [!INCLUDE [ua-character-limit](~/includes/managed-identity-ua-character-limits.md)]

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
    New-AzUserAssignedIdentity -ResourceGroupName <RESOURCEGROUP> -Name <USER ASSIGNED IDENTITY NAME>
    ```

## List user-assigned managed identities

To list or read a user-assigned managed identity, your account needs the [Managed Identity Operator](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#managed-identity-operator) or [Managed Identity Contributor](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#managed-identity-contributor) role assignment.

1. To list user-assigned managed identities, use the `Get-AzUserAssignedIdentity` command. The `-ResourceGroupName` parameter specifies the resource group where the user-assigned managed identity was created.
1. Replace the `<RESOURCE GROUP>` value with your own value.

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
    Get-AzUserAssignedIdentity -ResourceGroupName <RESOURCE GROUP>
    ```

    In the response, user-assigned managed identities have the `"Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities"` value returned for the key `Type`.

    `Type :Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities`

## Delete a user-assigned managed identity

To delete a user-assigned managed identity, your account needs the [Managed Identity Contributor](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#managed-identity-contributor) role assignment.

1. To delete a user-assigned managed identity, use the `Remove-AzUserAssignedIdentity` command. The `-ResourceGroupName` parameter specifies the resource group where the user-assigned identity was created. The `-Name` parameter specifies its name.
1. Replace the `<RESOURCE GROUP>` and the `<USER ASSIGNED IDENTITY NAME>` parameter values with your own values.

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
    Remove-AzUserAssignedIdentity -ResourceGroupName <RESOURCE GROUP> -Name <USER ASSIGNED IDENTITY NAME>
    ```

    Deleting a user-assigned managed identity won't remove the reference from any resource it was assigned to. Identity assignments must be removed separately.

# Use Azure CLI to grant a managed identity access to a resource

This article shows you how to use the Azure CLI to give a managed identity access to an Azure resource. In this article, we use the example of an Azure virtual machine (Azure VM) managed identity accessing an Azure storage account. Once you've configured an Azure resource with a managed identity, you can then give the managed identity access to another resource, similar to any security principal.

## Prerequisites

- Be sure you've enabled managed identity on an Azure resource, such as an [Azure virtual machine](how-to-configure-managed-identities.md). 
- If you don't already have an Azure account, [sign up for a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn) before continuing.

## Prepare your environment

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-no-header.md](~/../docs/reusable-content/azure-cli/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-no-header.md)]

## Use Azure RBAC to assign a managed identity access to another resource

1. In this example, you give an Azure virtual machine (VM) managed access to a storage account. First use [az resource list](/cli/azure/resource#az-resource-list) to get the service principal for a VM named myVM:

   ```azurecli-interactive
   spID=$(az resource list -n myVM --query [*].identity.principalId --out tsv)
   ```
   For an Azure Virtual Machine (VM) scale set, the command is the same except here you get the service principal for the VM set named "DevTestVMSS":
   
   ```azurecli-interactive
   spID=$(az resource list -n DevTestVMSS --query [*].identity.principalId --out tsv)
   ```

1. Once you have the service principal ID, use [az role assignment create](/cli/azure/role/assignment#az-role-assignment-create) to give the virtual machine or virtual machine scale set **Reader** access to a storage account called "myStorageAcct":

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az role assignment create --assignee $spID --role 'Reader' --scope /subscriptions/<mySubscriptionID>/resourceGroups/<myResourceGroup>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/myStorageAcct
   ```

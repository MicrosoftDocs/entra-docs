# Global Secure Access client for macOS (Preview)
The Global Secure Access client, an essential component of Global Secure Access, helps organizations manage and secure network traffic on end-user devices. The client's main role is to route traffic that needs to be secured by Global Secure Access to the cloud service. All other traffic goes directly to the network. The [Forwarding Profiles](concept-traffic-forwarding.md), configured in the portal, determine which traffic the Global Secure Access client routes to the cloud service.

This article describes how to download and install the Global Secure Access client for macOS.

## Prerequisites

- A Mac device with an Intel, M1, M2, or M3 processor, running macOS version 13 or newer.
- A device registered to Microsoft Entra tenant using Company Portal.
- A Microsoft Entra tenant onboarded to Global Secure Access.
- Deployment of the [Microsoft Enterprise single sign-on (SSO) plug-in for Apple devices](../identity-platform/apple-sso-plugin.md) is recommended for SSO experience based on the user who is signed in to the company portal.   
- An internet connection.

## Download the client

The most current version of the Global Secure Access client is available to download from the Microsoft Entra admin center.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as a [Global Secure Access Administrator](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#global-secure-access-administrator).
1. Browse to **Global Secure Access** > **Connect** > **Client download**.
1. Select **Download Client**.

## Install the Global Secure Access client
### Automated installation
Use the following command for silent installation. 
*Substitute your file path according to the download location of the .pkg file.*

`sudo installer -pkg ~/Downloads/GlobalSecureAccessClient.pkg -target / -verboseR`

The client uses system extensions and a transparent application proxy that need to be approved during the installation. For a silent deployment without prompting the end user to allow these components, you can deploy a policy to automatically approve the components.

### Allow system extensions through mobile device management (MDM)
The following instructions are for [Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/apps/apps-win32-app-management) and you can adapt them for different MDMs:

1. In the Microsoft Intune admin center, select **Devices** > **Manage devices** > **Configuration** > **Policies** > **Create** > **New policy**.
1. Create a profile for the macOS platform based on a template of type **Extensions**. Select **Create**.
:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-install-macos-client/macos-client-create-profile.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Create a profile form with the macOS Platform, Templates Profile type, and the Extensions template highlighted.":::
1. On the **Basics** tab, enter a name for the new profile and select **Next**.
1. On the **Configuration settings** tab, enter the **Bundle identifier** and the **Team identifier** of the two extensions according to the following table. Select **Next**.   
 
|Bundle identifier  |Team identifier  |
|---------|---------|
|com.microsoft.naas.globalsecure.tunnel-df     |UBF8T346G9         |
|com.microsoft.naas.globalsecure-df     |UBF8T346G9         |

5. Complete the creation of the profile by assigning users and devices according to your needs.

### Allow transparent application proxy through MDM
The following instructions are for [Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/apps/apps-win32-app-management) and you can adapt them for different MDMs:

1. In the Microsoft Intune admin center, select **Devices** > **Manage devices** > **Configuration** > **Policies** > **Create** > **New policy**.
1. Create a profile for the macOS platform based on a template of type **Custom** and select **Create**.
:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-install-macos-client/macos-client-create-profile-custom.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Create a profile form with the macOS Platform, Templates Profile type, and Custom template highlighted.":::
1. On the **Basics** tab, enter a **Name** for the profile.

## Upgrade the Global Secure Access client
The client installer supports upgrades. You can use the installation wizard to install a new version on a device that is currently running a previous client version.

For a silent upgrade, use the following command.    
*Substitute your file path according to the download location of the .pkg file.*

`sudo installer -pkg ~/Downloads/GlobalSecureAccessClient.pkg -target / -verboseR`

## Uninstall the Global Secure Access client
To manually uninstall the Global Secure Access client, use the following command.

`sudo /Applications/Global\ Secure\ Access\ Client.app/Contents/Resources/install_scripts/uninstall`

If you're using an MDM, uninstall the client with the MDM.

## Known limitations
Known limitations for the current version of the Global Secure Access client include:

### Secure Domain Name System (DNS)
If Secure DNS is enabled on the browser or in macOS and the DNS server supports Secure DNS, then the client doesn't tunnel traffic set to be acquired by FQDN. (Network traffic that's acquired by IP isn't affected and is tunneled according to the forwarding profile.) To mitigate the Secure DNS issue, disable Secure DNS, set a DNS server that doesn't support Secure DNS, or create rules based on IP.

### IPv6 not supported
The client tunnels only IPv4 traffic. IPv6 traffic isn't acquired by the client and therefore routed directly to the network.
To make sure that all traffic is routed to Global Secure Access, disable IPv6.

### Connection fallback
If there's a connection error to the cloud service, the client falls back to either direct Internet connection or blocking the connection, based on the ***hardening*** value of the matching rule in the forwarding profile.

### Geolocation of source IP address
For network traffic that is tunneled to the cloud service, the application server (website) detects the connection's source IP as the edge's IP address (and not as the user-device's IP address). This scenario might affect services that rely on geolocation.
> [!TIP]
> For Office 365 and Entra to detect the device's true source IP, consider enabling [Source IP restoration](how-to-source-ip-restoration.md).

### Virtualization support with UTM
- When the network is in **bridged** mode and Global Secure Access client is installed on the host machine:
    - If the Global Secure Access client is installed on the virtual machine, network traffic of the virtual machine is subject to its local policy. The host machine's policy doesn't affect the forwarding profile on the virtual machine.
    - If the Global Secure Access client *isn't* installed on the virtual machine, network traffic of the virtual machine is bypassed.
- The Global Secure Access client doesn't support network **shared** mode because it might block the network traffic of the virtual machine.
- If the network is in **shared** mode, you can install the Global Secure Access client on a virtual machine running macOS, as long as the client isn't also installed on the host machine.

### QUIC not supported for Internet Access
Since QUIC isn't yet supported for Internet Access, traffic to ports 80 UDP and 443 UDP can't be tunneled.
> [!TIP]
> QUIC is currently supported in Private Access and Microsoft 365 workloads.
Administrators can disable QUIC protocol on browsers, triggering clients to fall back to HTTPS over TCP, which is fully supported in Internet Access. For more information, see [QUIC not supported for Internet Access](troubleshoot-global-secure-access-client-diagnostics-health-check.md#quic-not-supported-for-internet-access).

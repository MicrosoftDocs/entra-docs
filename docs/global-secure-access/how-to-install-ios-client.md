# Global Secure Access client for iOS (Preview)
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Global Secure Access client for iOS is currently in PREVIEW.
> This information relates to a prerelease product that may be substantially modified before it's released. Microsoft makes no warranties, expressed or implied, with respect to the information provided here.

This article explains how to set up and deploy the Global Secure Access client app onto iOS and iPadOS devices. For simplicity, this article refers to both iOS and iPadOS as **iOS**.  

> [!CAUTION]
> Running other third-party endpoint protection products alongside Defender for Endpoint on iOS is likely to cause performance problems and unpredictable system errors.
> [!NOTE]
> - The Global Secure Access client is deployed via Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on iOS.
> - The Global Secure Access client on iOS uses a VPN. This VPN is not a regular VPN. Instead, it's a local/self-looping VPN.

## Prerequisites
- To use the Global Secure Access iOS client, configure the iOS endpoint device as a Microsoft Entra registered device.
- To enable Global Secure Access for your tenant, refer to the [Licensing requirements](overview-what-is-global-secure-access.md#licensing-overview). If needed, you can [purchase licenses or get trial licenses](https://aka.ms/azureadlicense).   
- Onboard the tenant to Global Secure Access and configure one or more traffic forwarding profiles. For more information, see [Access the Global Secure Access area of the Microsoft Entra admin center](quickstart-access-admin-center.md).

## Requirements
### Network requirements
For Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on iOS (available in the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-defender-security/id1526737990)) to function when connected to a network, you must configure the firewall/proxy to [Enable access to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint service URLs](/defender-endpoint/configure-environment#enable-access-to-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-service-urls-in-the-proxy-server).   

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on iOS isn't supported on userless or shared devices.

### System requirements
The iOS device (phone or tablet) must meet the following requirements:
- The device has iOS 15.0 or newer installed.
- The device has the Microsoft Authenticator app or the Intune Company Portal app installed.
- The device is enrolled to enforce Intune device compliance policies.

## Supported modes
The Global Secure Access client for iOS supports installation on both modes of enrolled devices: supervised and unsupervised devices.

## Supported traffic forwarding profiles
The Global Secure Access client for iOS supports the Microsoft traffic forwarding profile and the Private Access traffic forwarding profile. For more information, see [Global Secure Access traffic forwarding profiles](concept-traffic-forwarding.md).

### Create a VPN profile and configure Global Secure Access for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
1. In the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://intune.microsoft.com/#home), go to **Devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **New Policy**.   
1. Set the **Platform** to **iOS/iPadOS**, the **Profile type** to **Templates**, and the **Template name** to **VPN**.   
1. Select **Create**.   
1. Type a name for the profile and select **Next**.   
1. Set the **Connection Type** to **Custom VPN**.  
1. In the **Base VPN** section, enter the following:   
    - **Connection Name**: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
    - **VPN server address**: 127.0.0.1
    - **Auth method**: "Username and password"
    - **Split Tunneling**: Disable
    - **VPN identifier**: com.microsoft.scmx
1. In the key-value pairs fields:   
    - Add the key **SilentOnboard** and set the value to **True**.
    - Add the key **EnableGSA** and set the appropriate value from the following table:

        |Key |Value |Details |
        |---------|---------|---------|
        |EnableGSA |No value |Global Secure Access isn't enabled and tile isn't visible. |
        |  |0 | Global Secure Access in not enabled and tile isn't visible.|
        |  |1 | Global Secure Access tile is visible and defaults to disabled state. User can enable or disable using the toggle.|
        |  |2 | Global Secure Access tile is visible and defaults to enabled state. User can enable or disable using the toggle from the app. |
        |  |3 | Global Secure Access tile is visible and defaults to enabled state. User cannot disable Global Secure Access. |   

    - Add more key-value pairs as required (optional):  

        |Key |Value |Details |

1. Continue filling out the VPN form:  
    - **Type of Automatic VPN**: On-demand VPN
    - **On Demand Rules**: select **Add** and then:
        - Set **I want to do the following** to **Connect VPN**.
        - Set **I want to restrict** to **All domains**.
:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-install-ios-client/ios-client-set-up-vpn.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the VPN screen showing example setup parameters.":::
1. To prevent end users from disabling VPN, set **Block users from disabling automatic VPN** to **Yes**. By default, this setting isn't configured and users can disable VPN only in the Settings.  
1. Select **Next** and assign the profile to targeted users.
1. In the **Review + Create** section, verify that all the information is correct and then select **Create**.
 
Once the configuration is complete and synced with the device, the following actions take place on the targeted iOS devices:
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint is deployed and silently onboarded.  
- The device is listed in the Defender for Endpoint portal.  
- A provisional notification is sent to the user device.  
- Global Secure Access and other Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE)-configured features are activated.

## Confirm Global Secure Access appears in Defender app
Because the Global Secure Access client for iOS is integrated with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, it's helpful to understand the end user experience. The client appears in the Defender dashboard after onboarding to Global Secure Access.   
:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-install-ios-client/ios-defender-dashboard.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the iOS Microsoft Defender dashboard.":::   

You can enable or disable the Global Secure Access client for iOS by setting the **EnableGSA** key in the [VPN profile](#create-a-vpn-profile-and-configure-global-secure-access-for-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint). Depending on the configuration settings, end users can enable or disable individual **Services** or the client itself using the appropriate toggles.   
:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-install-ios-client/ios-client-enabled-disabled.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Global Secure Access client on iOS showing both the Enabled and Disabled status screens.":::   

If the client is unable to connect, a toggle appears to disable the service. Users can come back later to try enabling the client.   
:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-install-ios-client/ios-unable-to-connect.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Global Secure Access client on iOS showing the message, Unable to connect.":::   

## Troubleshooting
- The Global Secure Access tile doesn't appear in the Defender app after onboarding the tenant:
    - Force stop the Defender app and relaunch it.
- Access to the Private Access application shows a connection time-out error after a successful interactive sign-in.
    - Reload the application (or refresh the web browser).

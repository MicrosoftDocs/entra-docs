# Install the Global Secure Access client for Microsoft Windows
The Global Secure Access client is an essential part of Global Secure Access. It helps organizations manage and secure network traffic on end-user devices. The client routes traffic that needs to be secured by Global Secure Access to the cloud service. All other traffic goes directly to the network. The [Forwarding Profiles](concept-traffic-forwarding.md) you set up in the portal decide which traffic the Global Secure Access client routes to the cloud service.

> [!NOTE]
> The Global Secure Access client is also available for macOS, Android, and iOS. To learn how to install the Global Secure Access client on these platforms, see [Global Secure Access client for macOS](how-to-install-macos-client.md), [Global Secure Access client for Android](how-to-install-android-client.md), and [Global Secure Access client for iOS](how-to-install-ios-client.md).   

This article describes how to download and install the Global Secure Access client for Windows.

## Install the Global Secure Access client
### Automated installation
Organizations can install the Global Secure Access client silently with the `/quiet` switch, or use Mobile Device Management (MDM) solutions, such as [Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/apps/apps-win32-app-management), to deploy the client to their devices.

### Use Microsoft Intune to deploy the Global Secure Access client

This section explains how to use Intune to install the Global Secure Access client on a Windows 11 client device.

#### Prerequisites

- A security group with devices or users to identify where to install the Global Secure Access client.

#### Package the client

Package the installation script into a `.intunewin` file.

1. Save the following PowerShell script to your device. Put the PowerShell script and the Global Secure Access `.exe` installer into a folder.  

> [!NOTE]
> The PowerShell installation script installs the Global Secure Access client, sets the `IPv4Preferred` registry key to prefer IPv4 over IPv6 traffic, and prompts for a reboot for the registry key change to take effect.

> [!TIP]
> Select to expand the PowerShell script.

#### Update the client to a newer version

To update to the newest client version, follow the [Update a line-of-business app](/mem/intune/apps/lob-apps-windows#update-a-line-of-business-app) steps. Be sure to update the following settings in addition to uploading the new `.intunewin` file:

- Client version
- Detection rule value set to the new client version number

In a production environment, it's a good practice to deploy new client versions in a phased deployment approach:

1. Leave the existing app in place.
1. Add a new app for the new client version, repeating the previous steps.
1. Assign the new app to a small group of users to pilot the new client version. It's okay to assign these users to the app with the old client version for an in-place upgrade.
1. Slowly increase the membership of the pilot group until you deploy the new client to all desired devices.
1. Delete the app with the old client version.

### Configure Global Secure Access client settings with Intune

Admins can use [remediation scripts](/intune/intune-service/fundamentals/remediations) in Intune to enforce client-side controls, such as preventing non-admin users from disabling the client or hiding specific buttons. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Set the `$gsaSettings` to the values your organization requires in both the detection and remediation scripts.

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure to configure these scripts to run in 64-bit PowerShell.

## Troubleshooting
To troubleshoot the Global Secure Access client, select the client icon in the taskbar and select one of the troubleshooting options: **Export logs** or **Advanced diagnostics tool**.

> [!TIP]
> Administrators can modify the Global Secure Access client menu options by revising the [Client registry keys](#client-registry-keys).

For more information on troubleshooting the Global Secure Access client, see the following articles:
- [Troubleshoot the Global Secure Access client: advanced diagnostics](troubleshoot-global-secure-access-client-advanced-diagnostics.md)
- [Troubleshoot the Global Secure Access client: Health check tab](troubleshoot-global-secure-access-client-diagnostics-health-check.md)

## Client registry keys
The Global Secure Access client uses specific registry keys to enable or disable different functionalities. Administrators can use a Mobile Device Management (MDM) solution, such as Microsoft Intune or Group Policy to control the registry values.
> [!CAUTION] 
> Don't change other registry values unless instructed by Microsoft Support.

### Restrict nonprivileged users
Administrators can prevent nonprivileged users on the Windows device from disabling or enabling the client by setting the following registry key:   
`Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Global Secure Access Client`   
`RestrictNonPrivilegedUsers REG_DWORD`

|Data|Description|
|--|--|
| 0x0 | Nonprivileged users on the Windows device can disable and enable the client. |
| 0x1 | Nonprivileged users on the Windows device are restricted from disabling and enabling the client. A UAC prompt requires local administrator credentials for disable and enable options. The administrator can also hide the disable button (see [Hide or unhide system tray menu buttons](#hide-or-unhide-system-tray-menu-buttons)). |

### Disable or enable Private Access on the client
This registry value controls whether Private Access is enabled or disabled for the client. If a user is connected to the corporate network, they can choose to bypass Global Secure Access and directly access private applications.

Users can disable or enable Private Access through the system tray menu.

> [!TIP]
> This option is available on the menu only if it isn't hidden (see [Hide or unhide system tray menu buttons](#hide-or-unhide-system-tray-menu-buttons)) and Private Access is enabled for this tenant.

Administrators can disable or enable Private Access for the user by setting the registry key:   
`Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Global Secure Access Client`

|Value  |Type  |Data  |Description  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|IsPrivateAccessDisabledByUser  |REG_DWORD  |0x0  |Private Access is enabled on this device. Network traffic to private applications goes through Global Secure Access.  |
|IsPrivateAccessDisabledByUser  |REG_DWORD  |0x1  |Private Access is disabled on this device. Network traffic to private applications goes directly to the network.  |

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-install-windows-client/global-secure-access-registry-key-private-access-enabled.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Registry Editor with the IsPrivateAccessDisabledByUser registry key highlighted.":::
	
If the registry value doesn't exist, the default value is 0x0, Private Access is enabled.

### Hide or unhide system tray menu buttons
Administrators can show or hide specific buttons in the client system tray icon menu. Create the values under the following registry key:   
`Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Global Secure Access Client`

|Value   |Type   |Data   |Default behavior   |Description   |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|HideSignOutButton   |REG_DWORD   |0x0 - shown   0x1 - hidden   |hidden   |Configure this setting to show or hide the **Sign out** action. This option is for specific scenarios when a user needs to sign in to the client with a different Microsoft Entra user than the one used to sign in to Windows. Note: You must sign in to the client with a user in the same Microsoft Entra tenant to which the device is joined. You can also use the **Sign out** action to reauthenticate the existing user.         |
|HideDisablePrivateAccessButton   |REG_DWORD   |0x0 - shown   0x1 - hidden   |hidden   |Configure this setting to show or hide the **Disable Private Access** action. This option is for a scenario when the device is directly connected to the corporate network and the user prefers accessing private applications directly through the network instead of through the Global Secure Access.   |   
|HideDisableButton   |REG_DWORD   |0x0 - shown   0x1 - hidden   |shown   |Configure this setting to show or hide the **Disable** action. When visible, the user can disable the Global Secure Access client. The client remains disabled until the user enables it again. If the **Disable** action is hidden, a nonprivileged user can't disable the client.   |

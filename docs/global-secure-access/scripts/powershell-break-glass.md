# Disable traffic forwarding and Conditional access policies using the Compliant Network condition in a break glass scenario

In the event of an outage or connectivity failure to Microsoft Entra Internet Access, your users remain protected. However, you may want to perform a "break glass" operation: Temporarily disabling traffic forwarding profiles and disabling the Compliant Network condition policies can help your users regain access to their Microsoft apps in favor of productivity.

Below you can view a sample script that can help you quickly disable traffic forwarding and switch your Conditional Access policies using the [Compliant Network](../how-to-compliant-network.md) condition into Report-Only mode.

## List and Disable Conditional access policies using the Compliant Network condition in a break glass scenario

The PowerShell script effectively disables any Conditional Access policies that use the Compliant Network condition. In an emergency situation, this script can be used to temporarily regain access for your users.

The sample requires the [Microsoft Graph Beta PowerShell module](/powershell/microsoftgraph/installation) 2.10 or newer.

```powershell
# gsabreakglass.ps1 places the Compliant Network Conditional Access Policies for a given tenant using Microsoft Entra Internet Access into Report-Only mode.
#
# Version 1.0
#
# This script requires following 
#    - PowerShell 5.1 (x64) or beyond
#    - Module: Microsoft.Graph.Beta
#
#
# Before you begin:
#    
# - Make sure you are running PowerShell as an Administrator
# - Make sure your Administrator persona is an leveraging an Entra ID emergency access admin account, not subject to Microsoft Entra Internet Access Compliant Network policy, as described in https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/security-emergency-access.
# - Make sure you run: Install-Module Microsoft.Graph.Beta -AllowClobber -Force
Import-Module Microsoft.Graph.Beta.Identity.SignIns
Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "Policy.Read.All,Policy.ReadWrite.ConditionalAccess,NetworkAccess.ReadWrite.All"

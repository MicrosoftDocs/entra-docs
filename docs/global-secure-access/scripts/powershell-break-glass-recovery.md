# Restore compliant network requirement after a break glass operation

After an outage is resolved, you need to make a fast and accurate recovery from a [break glass](./powershell-break-glass.md) operation.

Below you can view a script that can help you quickly regain the security value of [Global Secure Access](../overview-what-is-global-secure-access.md) and [Compliant Network](../how-to-compliant-network.md) for your users.

## Implement break glass recovery

The PowerShell script enables any forwarding profiles and any Conditional Access policies using the compliant network condition that were disabled in the [break glass](./powershell-break-glass.md) script. 

The sample requires the [Microsoft Graph Beta PowerShell module](/powershell/microsoftgraph/installation) 2.10 or newer.

```powershell
# recoveryscript.ps1 enables any Conditional Access policies using the Compliant Network condition that were disabled in a breakglass scenario. 
# This script is the recovery method once the GSA service is back up after running .\gsabreakglass.ps1
#
# Version 1.0
#
# This script requires following 
#    - PowerShell 5.1 (x64) or beyond
#    - Module: Microsoft.Graph.Beta
#
#
# Before you begin:
#    
# - Make sure you are running PowerShell as an Administrator
# - Make sure your Administrator persona is an leveraging an Entra ID emergency access admin account, not subject to Microsoft Entra Internet Access Compliant Network policy, as described in https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/security-emergency-access.
# - Make sure you run: Install-Module Microsoft.Graph.Beta -AllowClobber -Force
Import-Module Microsoft.Graph.Beta.Identity.SignIns
Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "Policy.Read.All,Policy.ReadWrite.ConditionalAccess"

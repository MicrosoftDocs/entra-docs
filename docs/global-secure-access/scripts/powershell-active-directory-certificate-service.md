# Use PowerShell to generate and sign TLS certificates using Active Directory Certificate Services

This script automates generating and signing Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates using Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS). It creates a certificate signing request (CSR) using the TLS inspection graph API. The script then submits the certificate to ADCS for signing, retrieves the signed certificate, and uploads the certificate and chain to TLS inspection settings.

## Generate and sign TLS certificates

```powershell
# This script requires the following:
#    - PowerShell 5.1 (x64) or later
#    - Module: Microsoft.Graph.Beta
#
# Before you begin:
#    
# - Make sure you're running PowerShell as an administrator
# - Make sure you run: Install-Module Microsoft.Graph.Beta -AllowClobber -Force
# - Make sure you have ADCS configured with a SubCA template and you have "<CAHostName>\<CACommonName>"
# Ensure Microsoft.Graph.Beta module is available

# Import module

Import-Module Microsoft.Graph.Beta.NetworkAccess

# Connect to Microsoft Graph (handles token for you)
Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "NetworkAccess.ReadWrite.All" -NoWelcome

# Modify the following with your own settings before running the script:
# Name of the certificate (letters and numbers only and within 12 characters)
$name = "TLSiCAName"
# Common Name (CN) for the certificate
$commonName = "Contoso TLS Demo"
# Organization Name (O) for the certificate
$organizationName = "Contoso"
#ADCS settings
# Make sure you have ADCS configured with a SubCA template and you have "<CAHostName>\<CACommonName>"
$Template = "SubCA"
$CAConfig="<CACommonName> of your ADCS server"

# Check if the External Certificate Authority Certificates already exists
try {
    $response = Get-MgBetaNetworkAccessTlExternalCertificateAuthorityCertificate
    if ($response.Count -gt 0) 
    {
     Write-Host "A certificate for TLS inspection already exists."
	 exit 1

# Use PowerShell to create and sign TLS certificates using OpenSSL

This script automates generating and signing Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates using OpenSSL. It creates a certificate signing request (CSR) using the TLS inspection graph API. The script creates a self-signed root certificate authority using OpenSSL, signs the CSR, and uploads the certificate and chain to TLS inspection settings.

## Prerequisites
- Install OpenSSL for Windows or Linux.

> [!NOTE]
> While other tools might be available for certificate management, this sample code in this article uses OpenSSL. OpenSSL is bundled with many Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu.

## Generate and sign TLS certificates

```powershell
# This script requires the following:
#    - PowerShell 5.1 (x64) or later
#    - Module: Microsoft.Graph.Beta
#
# Before you begin:
#    
# - Make sure you're running PowerShell as an administrator
# - Make sure you run: Install-Module Microsoft.Graph.Beta -AllowClobber -Force
# Ensure Microsoft.Graph.Beta module is available

# Import Module

Import-Module Microsoft.Graph.Beta.NetworkAccess

# Connect to Microsoft Graph (handles token for you)
Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "NetworkAccess.ReadWrite.All" -NoWelcome

# Modify the following with your own settings before running the script:
# Parameters of the certificate sign request (letters and numbers only and within 12 characters).
    $name = "TLSiDemoCA"
    $commonName = "Contoso TLS Demo"
    $organizationName = "Contoso"

# Replace with your openSSLpath
    $openSSLPath = "C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\bin\openssl.exe"

# Self-signed CA file names
$rootKey = "TlsDemorootCA.key"
$rootCert = "TlsDemorootCAcert.pem"
$subject = "/C=US/ST=Washington/L=Redmond/O=Contoso/CN=Contoso"
$signedCert = "signedcertificate.pem"

#: Check if External Certificate Authority Certificates already exists
try {
    $response = Get-MgBetaNetworkAccessTlExternalCertificateAuthorityCertificate
    if ($response.Count -gt 0) {
        Write-Host "A certificate for TLS inspection already exists."
	    exit 1
    }

# Save CSR to file

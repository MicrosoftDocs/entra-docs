# Learn about Security Service Edge (SSE) coexistence with Microsoft and Zscaler

Microsoft and Zscaler’s Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) solution can be used together in a unified environment. When used together, you harness a robust set of capabilities from both platforms to elevate your SASE journey. The synergy between these platforms enhances security and provides seamless connectivity. 

This document contains steps to deploy these solutions side by side, specifically, Microsoft Entra Global Secure Access for Internet Access and Microsoft 365 applications such as Exchange Online and SharePoint Online, and Zscaler Private Access for private applications. It also contains steps to deploy Entra Global Secure Access for Microsoft 365 applications and Zscaler Internet Access for Internet Access.

## Configuration overview

Two configurations are covered in this article. 

In the first configuration, you enable the Microsoft 365 and Internet Access traffic forwarding profiles in the Microsoft Entra admin center. You disable the Private Access traffic forwarding profile in the Microsoft Entra admin center. The Global Secure Access client captures Microsoft 365 and Internet traffic. The Zscaler client captures Private Access traffic.

> [!NOTE]
> The clients must be installed on a Windows 10 or Windows 11 Entra joined device.

In the second configuration, you enable the Microsoft 365 forwarding profile and disable the Internet Access and Private Access traffic forwarding profiles in the Microsoft Entra admin center. The Global Secure Access client captures Microsoft 365 traffic. The Zscaler client captures Internet Access traffic.

> [!NOTE]
> The clients must be installed on Windows 10 or Windows 11 Entra joined device or a macOS Monterey device registered to Entra with Intune Company Portal. 

## Microsoft Entra Internet Access and Microsoft Entra Private Access configuration

Configure the traffic forwarding profiles for your Microsoft Entra tenant. For more information about enabling and disabling profiles, see [Global Secure Access traffic forwarding profiles](concept-traffic-forwarding.md).

For the first configuration, enable the Microsoft 365 and Internet Access traffic forwarding profiles. For the second configuration, enable the Microsoft 365 traffic forwarding profile only.

Install and configure the Global Secure Access Client on end-user devices. For more information about clients, see [Global Secure Access clients](concept-clients.md). To learn how to install the Windows client, see [Global Secure Access client for Windows](how-to-install-windows-client.md).

## Zscaler configuration 1

Configure single sign-on (SSO) authentication for Zscaler Private Access (ZPA). For more information on configuring SSO, see [https://help.zscaler.com/zpa/configuration-guide-microsoft-azure-ad](https://help.zscaler.com/zpa/configuration-guide-microsoft-azure-ad).

Configure and deploy Zscaler app connectors. For more information on Zscaler app connectors, see [https://help.zscaler.com/zpa/app-connector-management/app-connectors](https://help.zscaler.com/zpa/app-connector-management/app-connectors).

1. Navigate to **ZPA admin portal** > **Configuration & Control** > **Private Infrastructure** > **App Connector Management** > **App Connectors** > **Add App Connector**.
1. Deploy App Connector on your supported platform by following the respective guide. 
1. Verify that the deployed App Connector is running and healthy. 

Configure Zscaler application segments. For more information on Zscaler application segments, see [https://help.zscaler.com/zpa/configuring-application-segments](https://help.zscaler.com/zpa/configuring-application-segments).

1. Add Name, IP/FQDN of your private application, ports, and Segment Group.
1. Create an access policy to allow access to your private application (By default, ZPA blocks access to applications and segment groups for users until you configure policy rules that explicitly allow access). Navigate to **Policy** > **Access Policy** > **Add Rule**.

Download Zscaler client from the Zscaler Client Connector App Store in the Zscaler Client Connector Portal.
1. Navigate to **ZPA admin portal** > **Client Connector** > **Administration** > **Client Connector App Store** > **New Releases** > **General Availability**.
1. Select Platform as Windows and download the executable (EXE) or Microsoft Software Installer (MSI) package.
1. Enable build.

Add Forwarding Profile from the Client Connector Portal.
1. Navigate to **ZPA admin portal** > **Client Connector** > **Administration** > **Forwarding Profile** > **Add Forwarding Profile**.

1. Scroll down and add these Microsoft SSE service Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs) in  
“HOSTNAME OR IP ADDRESS BYPASS FOR VPN GATEWAY” field. IPs: `150.171.19.0/24`, `150.171.20.0/24`, `13.107.232.0/24`, `13.107.233.0/24`, `150.171.15.0/24`, `150.171.18.0/24`, `151.206.0.0/16`, `6.6.0.0/16`.

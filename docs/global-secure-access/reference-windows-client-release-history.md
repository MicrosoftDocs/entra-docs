## Version 2.18.62
Released for download on April 29, 2025.
### Functional changes
- Bug fix: Canonical name (CNAME) records resolve as A records to fix a Kerberos browser authentication issue.   
- The default client authentication is Web Account Manager (WAM).   
### Other changes
- Bug fix: the client retries connecting to traffic profiles after they're removed from the portal.   
- Bug fix: adds support for operating system names with non-ASCII characters, relevant for some non-English Windows versions.   
- Added and improved health check tests.   
- Improvements and bug fixes for Advanced diagnostics.   
- Miscellaneous bug fixes and improvements.   

## Version 2.14.80
Released for download on February 26, 2025.
### Functional changes
- Adds support for long-lived User Datagram Protocol (UDP) connections.
- Adds support for routing connections directly to the network when there's no successful tunnel established to the Global Secure Access cloud service.
- Adds performance counters to Performance Monitor:
    - Flow count
    - Tunnel count
- Adds support for Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty environments.
- Bug fix: Global Secure Access doesn't preserve the Disable Private Access status after a restart.
### Other changes
- Sends device name to the Global Secure Access cloud service.
- Bug fix: time sync fails when Internet Access is enabled.
- Adds telemetry for connections that fail to tunnel and fall back to hardening action.
- Verifies client certificate validity before using the certificate to establish a mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) connection.
- Improvements and bug fixes for Advanced diagnostics.

## Version 2.8.45
Released for download on November 26, 2024.
### Functional changes
- Adds support for mTLS connections to Global Secure Access. 
> [!NOTE]
> The mTLS connection rolls out gradually to customers through the cloud service. Customers continue to use the Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection until they receive mTLS.
- Adds support for restricting nonprivileged users from disabling and enabling the Global Secure Access client on their device.
- Show health check tests when loading a log zip file to Advanced diagnostics.
- Adds support for the Hyper-V internal switch: the Global Secure Access client installed on the host bypasses network traffic from Hyper-V guest machines. If needed, the Global Secure Access client can be installed on the guest machine, on the host machine, or both. 
> [!NOTE]
> The Global Secure Access client doesn't support host machines with a Hyper-V external virtual switch.
- The forwarding profile update is triggered when a user signs in to Windows.
- Global Secure Access client's driver events are written to the Event Viewer under:    
`Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > Global Secure Access > Kernel`
- Performance improvements for tunneled network traffic.
- Notifications for entering and exiting captive portals are off by default.
- On the Advanced diagnostics **Traffic** tab, status information appears in two columns: **Connection status** and **Status Details**. If the Global Secure Access service stops a connection (for example, due to a filtering policy set to block), the **Connection status** column shows "Terminated" and the **Status Details** column shows the reason for the termination.  
- To accommodate when sign-in is required, the sign-in window is shown even if Windows notifications are disabled.
### Other changes

    - "Global Secure Access Management Service" is now "Global Secure Access Engine Service."

## Version 2.8.45
Released for download on November 26, 2024.
### Functional changes
- Support for mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) connections to Global Secure Access. 
> [!NOTE]
> The mTLS connection will have a gradual rollout to customers through the service in the cloud; customers will continue to use the TLS connection until they recieve mTLS.
- Support for restricting nonprivileged users from disabling and enabling the Global Secure Access client on their device.
- Show health check tests when loading a log zip file to advanced diagnostics.
- Support for the Hyper-V internal switch: the Global Secure Access client installed on the host bypasses network traffic from Hyper-V guest machines. If needed, the Global Secure Access client can be installed on the guest machine, on the host machine, or both. 
> [!NOTE]
> Host machines that have the Hyper-V external virtual switch do not support this version of the Global Secure Access client.
- The forwarding profile update is triggered when a user signs in to Windows.
- Global Secure Access client's driver events are written to the Event Viewer under:    
`Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > Global Secure Access > Kernel`
- Performance improvements for tunneled network traffic.
- Notifications when entering and exiting captive portal are turned off by default.
- On the Advanced diagnostics **Traffic** tab, status information appears across two columns: the **Connection status** and **Status Details**. If the Global Secure Access service stops a connection (for example, due to a filtering policy set to block), the **Connection status** column shows "Terminated" and the **Status Details** column shows the reason for the termination.  
- To accommodate when sign-in is required, the sign-in window is shown even if Windows notifications are disabled.
### Other changes
- Renamed services:
    - "Global Secure Access Management Service" is now called "Global Secure Access Engine Service."
    - "Global Secure Access Auto Upgrade Service" is now called "Global Secure Access Client Manager Service."

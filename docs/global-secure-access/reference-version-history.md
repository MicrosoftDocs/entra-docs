# Microsoft Entra private network connector: version release history
This article lists the versions and features of the Microsoft Entra private network connector. The Microsoft Entra ID team regularly updates the private network connector with new features and functionality. Microsoft Entra private network connectors are updated automatically when a new major version is released.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft Entra application proxy and Microsoft Entra Private Access use the private network connector.

Make sure that auto updates are enabled for your connectors to get the latest features and bug fixes. Microsoft Support might ask you to install the latest connector version to resolve a problem.

September 20, 2018: Released for download.

### New features and improvements

- Added WebSocket support for the QlikSense application. To learn more about how to integrate QlikSense with application proxy, see this [walkthrough](../identity/app-proxy/application-proxy-qlik.md). 
- Improved the installation wizard to make it easier to configure an outbound proxy. 
- Set TLS 1.2 as the default protocol for connectors. 
- Added a new End-User License Agreement (EULA).

Improved control over connectors' outbound connection limits. 

## Version 1.5.36.0

### Release status

April 15, 2017: Released for download.

### New features and improvements

- Simplified onboarding and management with fewer required ports. Application proxy now requires opening only two standard outbound ports: 443 and 80. Application proxy continues to use only outbound connections, so you still don't need any components in a public facing network. For more information, see our [configuration documentation](../identity/app-proxy/application-proxy-add-on-premises-application.md).  
- If supported by your external proxy or firewall, you can now open your network by DNS instead of IP range. Application proxy services require connections to `*.msappproxy.net` and `*.servicebus.windows.net` only.


## Earlier versions

If you're using a private network connector version earlier than 1.5.36.0, update to the latest version to ensure you have the latest fully supported features.

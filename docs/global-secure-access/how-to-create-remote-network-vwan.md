# Simulate remote network connectivity using Azure vWAN

This article explains how to simulate remote network connectivity using a remote virtual wide-area network (vWAN). If you want to simulate remote network connectivity using an Azure virtual network gateway (VNG), see the article, [Simulate remote network connectivity using Azure VNG](/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-simulate-remote-network).

## Prerequisites

To complete the steps in this process, you must have the following prerequisites in place:
- An Azure subscription and permission to create resources in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
- A basic understanding of virtual wide area networks (vWAN).
- A basic understanding of [site-to-site VPN connections](/azure/vpn-gateway/tutorial-site-to-site-portal).
- A Microsoft Entra tenant with the [Global Secure Access Administrator](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#global-secure-access-administrator) role assigned.
- A basic understanding of Azure virtual desktops or Azure virtual machines.

This document uses the following example values, along with the values in the images and steps. Feel free to configure these settings according to your own requirements.
- Subscription: Visual Studio Enterprise
- Resource group name: GlobalSecureAccess_Documentation
- Region: South Central US

## High-level steps
The steps to create a remote network using Azure vWAN require access to both the Azure portal and the Microsoft Entra admin center. To switch between them easily, keep Azure and Entra open in separate tabs. Because certain resources can take more than 30 minutes to deploy, set aside at least two hours to complete this process. Reminder: Resources left running can cost you money. When done testing, or at the end of a project, it's a good idea to remove the resources that you no longer need.

## Set up a vWAN in the Azure portal
There are three main steps to set up a vWAN:
1. [Create a vWAN](#create-a-vwan)
1. [Create a virtual hub with a site-to-site VPN gateway](#create-a-virtual-hub-with-a-vpn-gateway)
1. [Obtain VPN gateway information](#obtain-vpn-gateway-information)

### Create a vWAN
Create a vWAN to connect to your resources in Azure. For more information about vWAN, see the [vWAN Overview](/azure/virtual-wan/virtual-wan-about).
1.	From the Microsoft Azure portal, in the **Search resources** bar, type **vWAN** in the search box and select **Enter**.
1.	Select **vWANs** from the results. On the vWANs page, select **+ Create** to open the **Create WAN** page.
1.	On the **Create WAN** page, on the **Basics** tab, fill in the fields. Modify the example values to apply to your environment.
    - **Subscription**: Select the subscription that you want to use.
    - **Resource group**: Create new or use existing.
    - **Resource group location**: Choose a resource location from the dropdown. A WAN is a global resource and doesn't live in a particular region. However, you must select a region to manage and locate the WAN resource that you create.
    - **Name**: Type the Name that you want to call your vWAN.
    - **Type**: Basic or Standard. Select **Standard**. If you select Basic, understand that Basic vWANs can only contain Basic hubs. Basic hubs can only be used for site-to-site connections.
1.	After filling out the fields, at the bottom of the page, select **Review + create**.
 :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-create-remote-network-vwan/create-vwan.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Create WAN page with completed fields." lightbox="media/how-to-create-remote-network-vwan/create-vwan-expanded.png"::: 
1.	Once validation passes, select the **Create** button.

### Create a virtual hub with a VPN gateway
Next, create a virtual hub with a site-to-site virtual private network (VPN) gateway:
1.	Within the new vWAN, under **Connectivity**, select **Hubs**.
1.	Select **+ New Hub**.
1.	On the **Create virtual hub** page, on the **Basics** tab, fill in the fields according to your environment.
    - **Region**: Select the region in which you want to deploy the virtual hub.
    - **Name**: The name by which you want the virtual hub to be known.
    - **Hub private address space**: For this example, use 10.101.0.0/24. To create a hub, the address range must be in Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation and have a minimum address space of /24.
    - **Virtual hub capacity**: For this example, select **2 Routing Infrastructure Units, 3 Gbps Router, Supports 2000 VMs**. For more information, see [Virtual hub settings](/azure/virtual-wan/hub-settings).
    - **Hub routing preference**: Leave as default. For more information, see [Virtual hub routing preference](/azure/virtual-wan/about-virtual-hub-routing-preference).
    - Select **Next : Site to site >**.
:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-create-remote-network-vwan/vwan-create-new-hub-basics.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Create virtual hub page, on the Basics tab, with completed fields." lightbox="media/how-to-create-remote-network-vwan/vwan-create-new-hub-basics-expanded.png"::: 
1.	On the **Site to site** tab, complete the following fields:
    - Select **Yes** to create a Site-to-site (VPN gateway).
    - **AS Number**: The AS Number field can't be edited.
    - **Gateway scale units**: For this example, select **1 scale unit - 500 Mbps x 2**. This value should align with the aggregate throughput of the VPN gateway being created in the virtual hub.
    - **Routing preference**: For this example, select **Microsoft network** for how to route your traffic between Azure and the internet. For more information about routing preference via a Microsoft network or Internet Service Provider (ISP), see the [Routing preference](/azure/virtual-network/ip-services/routing-preference-overview) article.

    * **Image**: For this example, select **Windows 11 Enterprise multi-session + Microsoft 365 apps version 22H2**.
    * **Virtual machine size**: select **Standard D2s v3, 2 vCPU's, 8-GB memory**.
    * **Number of VMs**: 1 
    * **Virtual network**: select the virtual network created in previous step, **VirtualNetwork**. 
    * **Domain to join**: select **Microsoft Entra ID**.
    * Enter the admin account credentials. 
1. Leave other options to default and select **Review + create**.
1. When validation passes, select **Create**.
1. After about 30 minutes, the host pool will update to show that the deployment is complete.
1. Navigate to Microsoft Azure **Home** and select **Virtual machines**.
1. Select the virtual machine created in the previous steps.
1. Select **Connect** > **Connect via Bastion**.
1. Select **Deploy Bastion**. The system takes about 30 minutes to deploy the Bastion host.
1. After the Bastion is deployed, enter the same admin credentials used to create the Azure Virtual Desktop. 
1. Select **Connect**. The virtual desktop launches.

## Test security features with Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD)
In this step, we use the AVD to test access restrictions to the virtual network.

### Test the tenant restriction
Before testing, enable tenant restrictions on the virtual network.
1. In Microsoft Entra admin center, navigate to **Global Secure Access** > **Settings** > **Session management**.
1. Set the **Enable tagging to enforce tenant restrictions on your network** toggle to on.
1. Select **Save**.
1. You can modify the cross-tenant access policy by navigating to **Identity** > **External identities** > **Cross-tenant access settings**. For more information, see the article, [Cross-tenant access overview](../external-id/cross-tenant-access-overview.md).
1. Keep the default settings, which prevent users from logging in with external accounts on managed devices.

To test:
1. Sign in to the Azure Virtual Desktop virtual machine created in the previous steps.
1. Go to www.office.com and sign in with an internal organization ID. This test should pass successfully.
1. Repeat the above step, but with an *external account*. This test should fail due to blocked access.

### Test source IP restoration
Before testing, enable conditional access.
1. In Microsoft Entra admin center, navigate to **Global Secure Access** > **Settings** > **Session management**.
1. Select the **Adaptive Access** tab.
1. Set the **Enable Global Secure Access signaling in Conditional Access** toggle to on.
1. Select **Save**. For more information, see the article, [Source IP restoration](how-to-source-ip-restoration.md).

To test (option 1):
Repeat the tenant restriction test from the previous section: 
1. Sign in to the Azure Virtual Desktop virtual machine created in the previous steps.
1. Go to www.office.com and sign in with an internal organization ID. This test should pass successfully.
1. Repeat the above step, but with an *external account*. This test should fail because the source **IP address** in the error message is coming from the VPN gateway public IP address instead of the Microsoft SSE proxying the request to Entra.

To test (option 2):
1. In Microsoft Entra admin center, navigate to **Global Secure Access** > **Monitor** > **Remote network health logs**.
1. Select **Add Filter**. 
1. Select **Source IP** and type the VPN gateway public IP address. Select **Apply**.
:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-create-remote-network-vwan/remote-network-health-logs-filter.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Remote network health logs page with the Add filter menu open ready to type the Source IP.":::

The system restores the branch office's customer premises equipment (CPE) IP address. Because the VPN gateway represents the CPE, the health logs show the public IP address of the VPN gateway, not the proxy's IP address.

## Remove unneeded resources
When done testing, or at the end of a project, it's a good idea to remove the resources that you no longer need. Resources left running can cost you money. You can delete resources individually or delete the resource group to delete the entire set of resources.

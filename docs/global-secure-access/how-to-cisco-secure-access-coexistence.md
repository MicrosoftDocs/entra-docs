# Security Service Edge (SSE) coexistence with Microsoft and Cisco Secure Access

Learn how to configure Security Service Edge (SSE) coexistence using Global Secure Access and Cisco Secure Access.

In today's digital landscape, organizations need robust, unified solutions for secure and seamless connectivity. Global Secure Access and Cisco Secure Access offer complementary Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) capabilities. When integrated, these platforms enhance security and connectivity for diverse access scenarios.

This guide outlines how to configure and deploy Global Secure Access solutions alongside Cisco Secure Access SSE offerings. By using both platforms, you can optimize your organization's security posture while maintaining high-performance connectivity for private applications, Microsoft 365 traffic, and internet access.

## Scenarios

This guide covers the following coexistence scenarios:

1.  **[Microsoft Entra Private Access with Cisco Secure Internet Access](#1-microsoft-entra-private-access-with-cisco-secure-internet-access).**
In this scenario, Global Secure Access handles private application traffic. Cisco Secure Internet Access provides DNS security and SWG capabilities.

2.  **[Microsoft Entra Private Access with Cisco Secure Internet Access and Cisco Secure Private Access](#2-microsoft-entra-private-access-with-cisco-secure-internet-access-and-cisco-secure-private-access).**
In this scenario, both clients handle traffic for separate private applications. Global Secure Access handles private applications in Microsoft Entra Private Access, while the Cisco Secure Client - Zero Trust Access module handles private applications in Cisco Secure Private Access. Web and DNS traffic is protected by Cisco Secure Internet Access.

3.  **[Microsoft Entra Microsoft Access with Cisco Secure Internet Access and Cisco Secure Private Access](#3-microsoft-entra-microsoft-access-with-cisco-secure-internet-access-and-cisco-secure-private-access).**
Global Secure Access manages all Microsoft 365 traffic. The Cisco Secure Client - Zero Trust Access module handles private applications in Cisco Secure Private Access. Web and DNS traffic is protected by Cisco Secure Internet Access.

4.  **[Microsoft Entra Internet Access and Microsoft Access with Cisco Secure Private Access](#4-microsoft-entra-internet-access-and-microsoft-access-with-cisco-secure-private-access).**
Global Secure Access manages internet and Microsoft traffic. Cisco Secure Access handles only Private Access with the Cisco Secure Client - Zero Trust Access module.
## Prerequisites

To configure Global Secure Access and Cisco Secure Access for a unified SASE solution:

- Set up Global Secure Access (Microsoft Entra Internet Access and Microsoft Entra Private Access).
- Configure Cisco Secure Internet Access and Secure Private Access.
- Establish required FQDN and IP bypasses for integration between the platforms.

## Global Secure Access setup

1. **Enable and disable different traffic forwarding profiles** for your Microsoft Entra tenant. See [Traffic forwarding profiles](concept-traffic-forwarding.md).
1. **Install and configure the private network connector** for Private Access applications. See [Configure connectors](how-to-configure-connectors.md).
1. **Configure Quick Access** to private resources and set up private DNS and DNS suffixes. See [Configure Quick Access](how-to-configure-quick-access.md).
1. **Install and configure the Global Secure Access client** on end-user devices. See [Global Secure Access clients](concept-clients.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Private Network Connectors are required for Private Access applications.

## Cisco Secure Access setup

1. **Set up a resource connector** for private applications. See Cisco documentation for [managing resource connectors and connector groups](https://docs.sse.cisco.com/sse-user-guide/docs/manage-resource-connectors-and-connector-groups).
1. **Provision users and groups**. Integration with Microsoft Entra ID provides the best user experience. See Cisco documentation for [Microsoft Entra ID SAML configuration](https://docs.sse.cisco.com/sse-user-guide/docs/configure-azure-for-saml).
1. **Add private resources and create access policies**. See Cisco documentation for [managing private access rules](https://docs.sse.cisco.com/sse-user-guide/docs/manage-private-access-rules).
1. **Set up internet security and configure bypasses** for coexistence. See Cisco documentation for [managing internet security](https://docs.sse.cisco.com/sse-user-guide/docs/manage-internet-security).
1. **Install and configure the Cisco Secure Client**. See Cisco documentation for [downloading and installing the client for Windows and macOS](https://docs.sse.cisco.com/sse-user-guide/docs/manual-installation-of-cisco-secure-client-windows-and-macos).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Cisco released a Cisco Secure Client (CSC) feature to improve coexistence with Global Secure Access. These steps need to be performed after the initial installation, or re-installation (not required to run again when upgrading), of CSC version 5.1.10.x (or later).
> 1. Install Cisco Secure Client version 5.1.10.x.
> 1. Open CMD prompt as an administrator and run these commands:
> 1. `"%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Cisco\Cisco Secure Client\acsocktool.exe" -slwm 10`
> 1. `net stop csc_vpnagent && net stop acsock && net start csc_vpnagent`

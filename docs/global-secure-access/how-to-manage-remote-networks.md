# Manage remote networks

Remote networks connect your users in remote locations to Global Secure Access. Adding, updating, and removing remote networks from your environment are likely common tasks for many organizations. 

This article explains how to manage your existing remote networks for Global Secure Access.

## Prerequisites

- A **Global Secure Access Administrator** role in Microsoft Entra ID.
- The product requires licensing. For details, see the licensing section of [What is Global Secure Access](overview-what-is-global-secure-access.md). If needed, you can [purchase licenses or get trial licenses](https://aka.ms/azureadlicense).

### Known limitations

- At this time, remote networks can only be assigned to the Microsoft traffic forwarding profile.

## Update remote networks

You can update remote networks in the Microsoft Entra admin center or using the Microsoft Graph API.

### [Microsoft Entra admin center](#tab/microsoft-entra-admin-center)

To update the details of your remote networks:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as a [Global Secure Access Administrator](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#global-secure-access-administrator).
1. Browse to **Global Secure Access** > **Connect** > **Remote networks**.
1. Select the remote network you need to update.

There are three sections with details you can edit. **Basics**, **Links**, and **Traffic profiles**.

#### Basics

The basics page provides a way to delete a selected remote network. You change the name of a remote network after you create it. Select the pencil icon to edit the name of the remote network.

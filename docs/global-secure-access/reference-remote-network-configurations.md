# Valid remote network configurations for custom and default configurations

Device links are the physical routers that connect your remote networks, such as branch locations, to Global Secure Access (preview). There's a specific set of combinations you must use if you choose the **Custom** option when adding device links. If you choose the **Default** option, you must enter a specific combination of properties on the customer premises equipment (CPE).

## Custom and default details

The available regions, device types, autonomous system number (ASN), and border gateway protocol (BGP) addresses are used in both the default and custom configurations.

### Available device options

- barracudaNetworks
- checkPoint
- ciscoMeraki
- citrix
- fortinet
- hpeAruba
- netFoundry
- nuage
- openSystems
- paloAltoNetworks
- riverbedTechnology
- silverPeak
- vmWareSdWan
- versa

### Valid ASN

You can use any 2-byte values (between 1 to 65534) *except* for the following reserved ASNs:

- Azure reserved ASNs: 12076, 65517, 65518, 65519, 65520, 8076, 8075
- IANA reserved ASNs: 23456, >= 64496 && <= 64511, >= 65535 && <= 65551, 4294967295
- 65476

### Valid BGP addresses

You can use any BGP address *except* for the following addresses:

- 0.0.0.0/32
- 127.0.0.0/8
- 224.0.0.0/4
- 255.255.255.255/32

## Default IPSec/IKE configurations

When you select **Default** as your IPsec/IKE policy when configuring remote network device links in the Microsoft Entra admin center, we expect the following combinations in the tunnel handshake. Each value in the combination is entered on your CPE.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must specify both a Phase 1 *and* Phase 2 combination on your CPE.

### IKE Phase 1 combinations

| Properties | Combination 1 | Combination 2 | Combination 3 | Combination 4 | Combination 5 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IKE encryption | GCMAES256 | GCMAES128 | AES256 | AES128 | AES256 |
| IKE integrity | SHA384 | SHA256 | SHA384 | SHA256 | SHA256 |
| DH group | DHGroup24 | DHGroup24 | DHGroup24 | DHGroup24 | DHGroup2 |

### IKE Phase 2 combinations

| Properties | Combination 1 | Combination 2 | Combination 3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IPSec encryption | GCMAES256 | GCMAES192 | GCMAES128 |
| IPSec integrity | GCMAES256 | GCMAES192 | GCMAES128 |
| PFS Group | None | None | None |

## Custom IPSec/IKE combinations

When you select **Custom** as IPSec/IKE configuration when configuring remote network device links in the Microsoft Entra admin center, you must use one of the following combinations.

### IKE Phase 1 combinations

There no limitations for the IKE phase 1 combinations. Any mix and match of encryption, integrity, and DH group is valid.

### IKE Phase 2 combinations

The IPSec encryption and integrity configurations are provided in the following table:

| IPSec encryption | IPSec integrity |
| --- | --- |
| GCMAES128  | GCMAES128  |
| GCMAES192 | GCMAES192 |
| GCMAES256 | GCMAES256 |
| None | SHA256 |

- PFS group - No limitation.
- SA lifetime - must be >300 seconds.

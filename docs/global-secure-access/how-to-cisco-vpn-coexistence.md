# Security Service Edge (SSE) coexistence with Microsoft and Cisco VPNs

Organizations require robust, unified solutions to ensure secure and seamless connectivity. Microsoft Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) capabilities that, when integrated with Cisco Virtual Private Networks (VPN), provide enhanced security and connectivity for diverse access scenarios.

This guide outlines how to configure and deploy Microsoft Entra solutions alongside Cisco VPN offerings. By using both platforms, you can optimize your organization's security posture while maintaining high-performance connectivity for private applications, Microsoft 365 traffic, and internet access.

## Cisco remote access VPN platforms

This guide focuses on two Cisco remote access VPN platforms:

- **[Cisco Secure Access VPN-as-a-Service (VPNaaS)](#cisco-secure-access-vpnaas)** 
- **[Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Remote Access VPN](#cisco-asa-remote-access-vpn)**

## Cisco Secure Access VPNaaS

### Cisco Secure Access VPNaaS - scenarios
1.  **[Microsoft Entra Internet Access and Microsoft Access with Cisco Secure Access VPNaaS for private access](#1-microsoft-entra-internet-access-and-microsoft-access-with-cisco-secure-access-vpnaas-for-private-access).**
Global Secure Access handles internet and Microsoft traffic. Cisco Secure Access VPNaaS captures only private application traffic.

2.  **[Microsoft Entra Private Access, Internet Access, and Microsoft Access with Cisco Secure Access VPNaaS](#2-microsoft-entra-private-access-internet-access-and-microsoft-access-with-cisco-secure-access-vpn-for-private-access).**
Both clients handle traffic for separate private applications. Global Secure Access handles private applications in Microsoft Entra Private Access, while private applications hosted through Cisco Secure Access VPNaaS are accessed through Cisco Secure Client VPN. Global Secure Access handles internet and Microsoft traffic.

### Cisco Secure Access VPNaaS - prerequisites

To configure Microsoft and Cisco Secure Access VPNaaS for a unified SASE solution:

1. Set up Microsoft Entra Internet Access and Microsoft Entra Private Access. These products make up the Global Secure Access solution.
1. Establish connectivity to Cisco Secure Access VPNaaS.
1. Set up a Cisco remote access VPN profile.
1. Configure fully qualified domain name (FQDN) and IP bypasses (instructions below).

### Cisco Secure Access VPNaaS - Global Secure Access setup

1. Enable and disable different traffic forwarding profiles for your Microsoft Entra tenant. For more information, see [Global Secure Access traffic forwarding profiles](concept-traffic-forwarding.md).
1. Install and configure the Microsoft Entra private network connector. See [How to configure connectors](how-to-configure-connectors.md).
    > [!NOTE] 
    > Private network connectors are required for Microsoft Entra Private Access applications.
1. Configure Quick Access to private resources and set up private Domain Name System (DNS) and DNS suffixes. See [How to configure Quick Access](how-to-configure-quick-access.md).
1. Install and configure the Global Secure Access client on end-user devices. See [Global Secure Access clients](concept-clients.md). <a id="adding-a-custom-bypass"></a>
1. Add an Internet Access traffic forwarding profile custom bypass to exclude Cisco Secure Access VPNaaS service FQDN.
    1. Sign in to Microsoft Entra admin center and browse to **Global Secure Access > Connect > Traffic forwarding > Internet access profile**.
    2. Under Internet access policies, select **View**.
    3. Expand **Custom Bypass** and select **Add rule**.
    4. Leave destination type as FQDN and enter the Cisco Secure Access VPN head end service domain, `*.vpn.sse.cisco.com` in Destination.
    5. Select **Save**.

### Cisco Secure Access VPNaaS - Cisco Secure Access setup

#### Split-Include configuration

1. Configure the VPN profile Traffic Steering:
    1. From the Cisco Secure Access portal, go to **Connect > End User Connectivity > Virtual Private Network**.
    2. Select your VPN Profile, then **Traffic Steering**.
    3. In Tunnel Mode, select **Bypass Secure Access** and add exceptions (what to tunnel) for your private application subnets and the Global Secure Access synthetic IP range, `6.6.0.0/16`.
    4. In DNS Mode, select **Split DNS** and add the domain suffix of your private applications.
1. Install the Cisco Secure Client software.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently **Split-Include** is the only supported Cisco Secure Access VPNaaS configuration.

## Cisco Secure Access VPNaaS - configuration scenarios

### 1. Microsoft Entra Internet Access and Microsoft Access with Cisco Secure Access VPNaaS for private access

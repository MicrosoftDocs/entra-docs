# Export private network connector logs to the Log Analytics workspace

This article describes how to extract private network connector logs from connector machines that are deployed on the customer's network. Once extracted, those logs can be sent to the Log Analytics workspace in the customer’s Azure subscription. Extracting these logs is performed using Azure Arc and its extensions. Customers retain control and management of the logs in their Azure environment, which ensures that customers keep full ownership and security of their data.

## Prerequisites

To complete the steps in this process, you must have the following prerequisites in place:

- An active Azure subscription.
- An on-premises Windows machine running Microsoft Entra Private Network Connector that you want to connect to Azure Log Analytics. For more information, see [Understand the Microsoft Entra private network connector](concept-connectors.md). 
- Access to navigate and execute commands in the Azure portal. 
- A Microsoft Azure Arc account to manage on-premises and multicloud resources. For more information, see [Azure Arc overview](/azure/azure-arc/overview).

## Extract connector logs
To extract connector logs, you must enable verbose logging on the connector machine and then stream the logs to Log Analytics.

### Enable verbose logging on the connector machine
Verbose logs are useful when debugging Microsoft Entra Private Network Connector side issues for Entra Private Access. Verbose logging isn't enabled in the connector by default. 

To enable verbose logging:

1. Locate the installation directory of the connector at `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Entra Private Network Connector`.
2. Create a folder in the local directory with write permissions **On**. 
    
   To verify write permissions: 
    1. Right-click on the folder you created, then click **Properties**.  
    1. Go to the **Security** tab and make sure the **Write** property is checked for **Allow**. If **Write** isn't checked, select **edit**. 
    1.  On the pop-up window, select **allow** for the **write** row, then click **apply**. 
3. Right-click on a text editor application such as Notepad or Notepad++, and select **Run as Administrator**.
4. Open the file `MicrosoftEntraPrivateNetworkConnector.exe.config` to edit. 
5. From the following section, select the code from ```<system.diagnostics>``` to ```</system.diagnostics>``` and add it to the `MicrosoftEntraPrivateNetworkConnector.exe.config` file.

```json

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?> 

<configuration> 

  <runtime> 

     <gcServer enabled="true"/> 

  </runtime> 

  <appSettings> 

    <add key="TraceFilename" value="MicrosoftEntraPrivateNetworkConnector.log" /> 

  </appSettings> 

<system.diagnostics> 

  <trace autoflush="true" indentsize="4"> 

    <listeners> 

      <add name="consoleListener" type="System.Diagnostics.ConsoleTraceListener" /> 

      <add name="textWriterListener" type="System.Diagnostics.TextWriterTraceListener" initializeData="C:\logs\connector_logs.log" /> 

      <remove name="Default" /> 

    </listeners> 

  </trace> 

</system.diagnostics> 

</configuration>

```

   Next, you need to Stop and Start the Connector service for the above changes to take effect.

6. Type **Services** in the search box in the taskbar, then go to **Services**. 
7. Look for the **Microsoft Entra Private Network Connector** service from the Services list and select it.
8. Choose **Stop** the agent service, then **Start** the agent service again. At this point, you see a text file labeled `connector_logs.log` in the C:\logs\ folder. 

> [!NOTE]
> When verbose logging isn't enabled, the default log file location is stored at `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Temp`. When verbose logging is enabled, the log file is stored at `C:\logs\connector_logs.log`.
> Verbose logging can be enabled or disabled by adding or removing the lines specified in step 4. You must restart the service agent each time for the logging changes to take effect.

### Verify data collection
- Check Data in Log Analytics:

   After you've installed and configured the agent, it may take some time for data to start appearing.

	1. In the Azure portal, go to your Log Analytics workspace > Select your Workspace.
	1. Navigate to **Logs**, click exit on the pop-up hub > **Custom Logs** > Double Click on your log name. This adds the log name into the query. 
	1. Select **Run**. You see your logs.
    This setup allows you to collect text logs from on-premises Windows machines and send them to Azure Log Analytics using Azure Arc. The data collection rule ensures the logs are
    collected as per the defined paths, and the agent sends them to your Log Analytics workspace.

## Share access to your workspace 
Once you have the logs into the Log Analytics workspace, you can securely open access the logs to an external user (outside of your tenant) by sharing your workspace. One use case is to grant access to support personnel (as required) for any support issues. Support personnel can be from Microsoft CSS (Customer Service & Support), Engineering OCE (On Call Engineer), or the customer’s own support network. Giving access to your workspace can help with swiftly diagnosing the problem, positively impacting the Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) and Mean Time to Mitigate (MTTM), and by extension, customer satisfaction.

Here are the steps to provide access to an external user:

### Prerequisites

-	**Azure Subscription**: Ensure you have an active Azure subscription.
-	**Log Analytics Workspace**: An existing Log Analytics workspace that you want to share.
-	**Microsoft Entra ID Guest User**: The external user must be added as a guest user in your Microsoft Entra ID.

### Add external user as a guest in Microsoft Entra ID
1.	Navigate to Microsoft Entra ID:
	1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
	1. In the search bar, type **Microsoft Entra ID**, then select it.
2.	Add a New Guest User:
	1. In the Microsoft Entra ID dashboard, select **Manage -> Users**.
	1. Click on **+ New user**, then select **Invite external user**.
	1. Enter the external user's email address and fill in the required information.
	1. Click **Invite** to send an invitation to the external user.
The external user receives an email invitation to join your Microsoft Entra ID page as a guest.

### Assign roles to the guest user in Log Analytics workspace
1.	Navigate to the Log Analytics Workspace:
	- In the Azure portal, search for  **Log Analytics workspaces**, then select the workspace you want to share.
2.	Identity Access Control (IAM):
	1. In the workspace blade, select **Access control (IAM)** from the left-hand menu.
	1. Click on **+ Add**, then select **Add role assignment**.
3.	Assign a Role:
	1. Select a role to assign to the guest user. Common roles for accessing Log Analytics include:
	1. Log Analytics Reader: Allows the user to read and query logs.
	1. Log Analytics Contributor: Allows the user to read, query, and modify logs.
4.	Add the Guest User:
	1. In the Members section, click **Select members**.
	1. Search for the guest user you added earlier by their email address.
	1. Select the guest user and click **Select**.
5.	Review and Assign:
	- Review the role assignment and click **Review + assign** to complete the process.

### Ensure permissions are properly set
-	Verify Permissions:
	The guest user should now have access to the Log Analytics workspace with the permissions assigned. 
	- You can verify by going to **Access control (IAM)** in the Log Analytics workspace and checking the role assignments.

### External user access and query logs
1.	External User Access:
	- The external user needs to accept the invitation sent to their email and log into the Azure portal using their credentials.
2.	Accessing Log Analytics:
	1. Once logged in, the external user navigates to the Log Analytics workspace shared with them.	
    1. They can use the Log Analytics workspace's **Logs** feature to query and analyze logs based on the permissions granted.

### Other considerations
-	**Security**: Follow the principle of least privilege and ensure that you grant only the necessary permissions to the guest user.
-	**Monitoring and Auditing**: Regularly monitor and audit access to your Log Analytics workspace to ensure compliance and security.

By following these steps, you can securely open your Azure Log Analytics workspace to a user outside of your tenant, allowing them to access and query logs as needed.

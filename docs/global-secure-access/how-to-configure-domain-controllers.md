# Configure Microsoft Entra Private Access for Active Directory domain controllers (preview)

This guide describes how to configure Microsoft Entra Private Access for Active Directory Domain Controllers (DCs). This capability helps strengthen secure access for on-premises users by enforcing conditional access/MFA to on-premises applications that use Kerberos authentication with the DCs.

## Prerequisites

To configure Microsoft Entra Private Access for Active Directory Domain Controllers, you must have:

- The **Global Secure Access Administrator** role in Microsoft Entra ID.
- The product requires licensing. For details, see the licensing section of [What is Global Secure Access](overview-what-is-global-secure-access.md). If needed, you can [purchase licenses or get trial licenses](https://aka.ms/azureadlicense).
- The client machine is at least Windows 10 and is Microsoft Entra joined or hybrid joined device. The client machine must also have line of sight to the private resources and DC (user is in a corporate network and accessing on-premises resources). User identity used for joining the device and accessing these resources was created in Active Directory (AD) and synced to Microsoft Entra ID using Microsoft Entra Connect.
- The latest Microsoft Entra Private network connector is installed and has a line of sight to the DC.
- Open inbound Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) port `1337` in the Windows Firewall on the DCs.
- Identify the Service Principal Names (SPNs) of the private apps you want to protect. You add these SPNs in the policy for Private Access Sensors that are installed on the DCs.
> [!NOTE]
> The SPNs are *case insensitive* and should be an *exact match* or a wildcard in the format `<serviceclass>/*` such as `cifs/*`.
- Understand that one Private Access Sensor can be installed on a DC. To test this functionality, you donâ€™t need to install sensors on all DCs. A sensor is installed in `Audit` mode by default and you need to change it to `enforce` mode.
- As a best practice, we recommend testing this functionality with the private apps first. You can enforce MFA to the DC itself by using its SPN, however, we recommend that you test that at a later stage to avoid any issues of admin lockout.
- If you use NT LAN Manager (NTLM) v1/v2 in your environment, you might need to restrict NTLM and use Kerberos auth in the domain.

> [!Note]
> Setting the policy Restrict NTLM: NTLM authentication in this domain without performing an impact assessment first might cause service outage for those applications and users still using NTLM authentication.

## Configuration steps

Follow these steps to configure Microsoft Entra Private Access for Active Directory Domain Controllers.

### 1. Download and install the Microsoft Entra private network connector

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com).
1. Go to **Global Secure Access** > **Connect** > **Connectors and sensors** > **Private Network Connectors**.
1. Download the latest version of the private network connector.
1. Install the connector on a Windows Server that has line of sight to your domain controller.
1. After installation, verify the connector status is **Active** in the Microsoft Entra admin center.

> [!TIP]
> Note the private IP addresses of your connectors (for example, `10.5.0.7`). You need the IPs when configuring the Private Access Sensor policy.

### 2. Create a Global Secure Access application

Create a new Enterprise Application or use Quick Access to publish the domain controllers using their IP addresses or Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN). Publishing the DCs lets the Global Secure Access clients obtain Kerberos tickets. In addition, use Quick Access to configure SPNs. In this example, Quick Access is used to configure both.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com).
1. Go to **Global Secure Access** > **Applications** > **Quick Access** and then select **Add Quick Access application segment**. Use port `88` and select **TCP**.
1. You can configure the port in either a Quick Access or Enterprise Application.
1. Add the SPNs for the resources you want to secure. The system automatically delivers these SPNs to the Private Access Sensors installed on your domain controllers.

### 3. Assign users and configure Conditional Access

1. On the application settings page, Quick Access in this example, select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user/group** to assign the users who are synchronized from Active Directory in the Microsoft Entra application where you configured the domain controllers.
1. Create a Conditional Access policy that requires multifactor authentication (MFA) for these users. To learn how to create an MFA policy, see [Building a Conditional Access policy](/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-policies).

### 4. Enable the Private Access profile

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com).
1. Go to **Global Secure Access** > **Connect** > **Traffic forwarding** > **Private Access Profile**.
1. Enable the Private Access profile.

### 5. Install the Global Secure Access client

1. Download the latest Global Secure Access Windows client from **Global Secure Access** > **Connect** > **Client download** > **Windows 10/11**.
1. Install the client on a Windows 10/11 device that is Microsoft Entra joined or hybrid joined.
1. Ensure the client device has line of sight to the private applications and the domain controller.
1. After installation, pause (disable) the client.

### 6. Install the Private Access Sensor on the domain controller

1. Download the Private Access Sensor for DC from Microsoft Entra admin center at **Global Secure Access** > **Connect** > **Connectors and sensors** > **Private access sensors** > **Download private access sensor**.
1. Install by clicking the Private Access Sensor Installer and follow the steps.
1. During installation, sign in with a Microsoft Entra ID user when prompted.
1. After installation, in the Microsoft Entra admin center, go to **Global Secure Access** > **Connect** > **Connectors and sensors** > **Private access sensors** and verify the sensor status is **Active**.

> [!NOTE]
> The IP address shown is for illustration purposes only. You will see the actual IP address in a live environment.

### 7. Configure Private Access Sensor policy files

Installing the sensor creates two JSON policy files (`cloudpolicy` and `localpolicy`) at the sensor installation path.

1. Confirm that the SPNs configured earlier are present in the `cloudpolicy` file.
1. In the `localpolicy` file, add the private connector IPs to the `SourceIPAllowList` and save. Only Kerberos requests from these connector IPs are allowed; others are blocked.
1. If you add or update SPNs and/or Connector IPs, it can take a few minutes for changes to take effect. You don't need to restart the sensors.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Private Access Sensor is installed in Audit (report-only) mode by default. To enforce MFA, set the `AuditMode` registry key for `PrivateAccessSensor` from `1` to `0`. You will need to restart the sensors after updating the registry key.

## Exclusions and inclusions for SPNs

When configuring Service Principal Names (SPNs) in the Private Access Sensor policy, you may have users or machines in your environment that do not have the Global Secure Access client installed. To allow these users or machines to access the specified SPNs after the Private Access Sensor is deployed, you can configure exclusions or inclusions for each SPN in the `localpolicy` file.

> [!NOTE]
> Both `cloudpolicy` and `localpolicy` are evaluated for access. Only `localpolicy` can be used to configure exclusions or inclusions.

If no exclusion is defined for a given SPN, the default behavior is to block all direct access to that SPN unless it is accessed from a device with the Global Secure Access client installed.

### Exclusions

Exclusions allow specific users or machines to access configured SPNs without requiring the Global Secure Access client. You can add exclusions by:

- Client IP address
- IP address ranges
- On-premises username, which is the first part of a User Principal Name (UPN) such as `username@domain`.

You can configure multiple IP addresses, multiple IP ranges, or both for a single SPN. Similarly, you can exclude multiple usernames for an SPN.

### Inclusions

If you need to allow access for many users, you can instead specify an inclusion list for each SPN. When you configure included users for an SPN, only those users are required to have the Global Secure Access client. Users not included in the list can access the SPN without the client.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> An SPN can have either an inclusion list of UPN usernames or an exclusion list of UPN usernames, but not both.

### Combining exclusions and inclusions

- You can configure both UPN username inclusion and IP exclusion for a given SPN.
- You can configure both UPN username exclusion and IP exclusion for a given SPN.
- If a policy match occurs for both UPN username inclusion and IP exclusion, access to the SPN is allowed.
- If a policy matches more than one rule (for example, a wildcard), access to the SPN is allowed if it matches at least one exclusion rule.

> [!TIP]
> Use exclusions and inclusions to fine-tune access for users and devices that do not have the Global Secure Access client, ensuring business continuity while maintaining security controls.

Example of how to configure `localpolicy` file for SPN username exclusions and inclusions:
> ![Screenshot of the localpolicy file showing how to configure the file for SPN username exclusions and inclusions.](media/how-to-configure-domain-controllers/exclusions-and-inclusions.png)

#### Break glass mode

- Private Access Sensor supports a break glass mode to allow all traffic in emergencies.
- Enable break glass mode by changing the `TmpBreakglass` registry key from `0` to `1`.
- Changes can take a few minutes to propagate. Restarting the sensors is required if updates made to the registry key. 

### 8. Test Microsoft Entra Private Access for domain controllers

1. Keep both the Global Secure Access client and Private Access Sensors turned off.
1. Confirm that the DC FQDNs/IPs configured in the Quick Access app are present in the Global Secure Access client policy. Check via the Global Secure Access system tray icon: **Advanced Diagnostics** > **Traffic Forwarding Profile**.
1. (Optional) Run `nltest` from your client machine to list domain controllers.
1. Run `klist purge` to clear all Kerberos tickets.
1. Use `klist tgt get cifs/SPN` or access the Server Message Block (SMB) share to verify access to the target resource.
1. Turn on both Private Access Sensor services (keep the Global Secure Access client off).
1. Attempt to access the SMB file share; the sensor should block the request.
1. Turn on the Global Secure Access client and try to access the SPN again. You should receive Kerberos tickets, and MFA might be required if your Conditional Access policy enforces it.
1. To verify Kerberos traffic is tunneled through Global Secure Access, use Advanced Diagnostics in the Global Secure Access client.

### 9. Investigation and troubleshooting

- Use **Event Viewer** to review Private Access Sensor logs.
- To collect Private Access Sensor logs, run `PrivateAccessSensorLogsCollector` from the sensor installation path and share the generated zip file with Microsoft support.
- For Global Secure Access client logs:
    1. Right-click the Global Secure Access tray icon.
    2. Select **Advanced Diagnostics** > **Advanced log collection** > **Collect advanced logs**.
    3. Reproduce your issue, then stop log collection and submit the logs to Microsoft support.

> [!TIP]
> If you encounter issues, provide screenshots, command outputs, and collected logs to Microsoft support for further assistance.

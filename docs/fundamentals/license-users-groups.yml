  Assign or remove licenses
introduction: |
  Many Microsoft Entra services require you to license each of your users or groups (and associated members) for that service. Only users with active licenses will be able to access and use the licensed Microsoft Entra services for which that's true. Licenses are applied per tenant and don't transfer to other tenants. 

procedureSection:
  - title: |
      Available license plans
    summary: |
      There are several Microsoft Entra ID license plans:

      - Microsoft Entra ID Free
      - Microsoft Entra ID P1
      - Microsoft Entra ID P2

      For specific information about each license plan and the associated licensing details, see [What license do I need?](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/identity-access-management/azure-ad-pricing). To sign up for Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 license plans see [here](./get-started-premium.md).

      Not all Microsoft services are available in all locations. Before a license can be assigned to a group, you must specify the **Usage location** for all members. You can set this value in Microsoft Entra by going to **Identity** > **Users** > **All users** > *select a user* > **Properties**. 

      When assigning licenses to a group or bulk updates, such as disabling the synchronization status for the organization, any user whose usage location isn't specified inherits the location of the tenant.

      > [!IMPORTANT]
      > Licenses that a user inherits from a group can't be removed directly. Instead, you have to remove the user from the group from which they're inheriting the license.

      ### To remove a license from a group
    steps:
      - |
        On the **Licensed groups** page for the license plan, select the group that should no longer have the license.

        > [!NOTE]
        > When an on-premises user account synced to Microsoft Entra falls out of scope for the sync or when the sync is removed, the user is soft-deleted in Microsoft Entra ID. When this occurs, licenses assigned to the user directly or via group-based licensing will be marked as **suspended** rather than **deleted**.

# Configure Microsoft Entra for increased security (Preview)

The security recommendations in this document are designed to help you improve your security posture in Microsoft Entra. These recommendations are influenced by accepted industry standards like those developed by NIST, the configuration baselines we use internally at Microsoft, and our experiences with customers. The recommendations are organized by the [Secure Future Initiative](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center/security/secure-future-initiative?msockid=2bad2df65a416adb0e5838355b3e6b95#SFI-pillars) pillars:

- Protect identities and secrets
- Protect tenants and isolate production systems
- Protect networks
- Protect engineering systems
- Monitor and detect cyberthreats
- Accelerate response and remediation

> [!TIP]
> Some organizations might take these recommendations exactly as written, while others might choose to make modifications based on their own business needs. In our initial release of this guidance, we focus on traditional [workforce tenants](/entra/external-id/tenant-configurations#workforce-tenants). These workforce tenants are for your employees, internal business apps, and other organizational resources. 

We recommend that all of the following controls be implemented where licenses are available. These patterns and practices help to provide a foundation for other resources built on top of this solution. More controls will be added to this document over time.

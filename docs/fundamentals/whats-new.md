### General Availability - Improving visibility into downstream tenant sign-ins

**Type:** New feature    
**Service category:** Reporting    
**Product capability:** Monitoring & Reporting    

Microsoft Security wants to ensure that all customers are aware of how to notice when a partner is accessing a downstream tenant's resources. Interactive sign-in logs currently provide a list of sign in events, but there's no clear indication of which logins are from partners accessing downstream tenant resources. For example, when reviewing the logs, you might see a series of events, but without any additional context, it’s difficult to tell whether these logins are from a partner accessing another tenant’s data.

Here's a list of steps that one can take to clarify which logins are associated with partner tenants:

1. Take note of the  "ServiceProvider" value in the CrossTenantAccessType column:
    - This filter can be applied to refine the log data. When activated, it immediately isolates events related to partner logins.
2. Utilize the "Home Tenant ID" and "Resource Tenant ID" Columns:
    - These two columns identify logins coming from the partner’s tenant to a downstream tenant.


After seeing a partner logging into a downstream tenant’s resources, an important follow-up activity to perform is to validate the activities that might have occurred in the downstream environment. Some examples of logs to look at are Microsoft Entra Audit logs for Microsoft Entra ID events, Microsoft 365 Unified Audit Log (UAL) for Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Entra ID events, and/or the Azure Monitor activity log for Azure events. By following these steps, you're able to clearly identify when a partner is logging into a downstream tenant’s resources and subsequent activity in the environment, enhancing your ability to manage and monitor cross-tenant access efficiently.

To increase visibility into the aforementioned columns, Microsoft Entra will begin enabling these columns to display by default when loading the sign-in logs UX starting on March 7, 2025.

### Public Preview - Auditing administrator events in Microsoft Entra Connect

**Type:** New feature    
**Service category:** Microsoft Entra Connect    
**Product capability:** Microsoft Entra Connect    

We have released a new version of Microsoft Entra Connect, version 2.4.129.0, that supports the logging of the changes an administrator makes on the Connect Sync Wizard and PowerShell. For more information, see: [Auditing administrator events in Microsoft Entra Connect Sync (Public Preview)](../identity/hybrid/connect/admin-audit-logging.md).

Where supported, we'll also autoupgrade customers to this version of Microsoft Entra Connect in February 2025. For customers who wish to be autoupgraded, [ensure that you have auto-upgrade configured](../identity/hybrid/connect/how-to-connect-install-automatic-upgrade.md).

For upgrade-related guidance, see [Microsoft Entra Connect: Upgrade from a previous version to the latest](../identity/hybrid/connect/how-to-upgrade-previous-version.md).

### Public Preview - Flexible Federated Identity Credentials

**Type:** New feature    
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)    
**Product capability:** Developer Experience    

Flexible Federated Identity Credentials extend the existing Federated Identity Credential model by providing the ability to use wildcard matching against certain claims. Currently available for GitHub, GitLab, and Terraform Cloud scenarios, this functionality can be used to lower the total number of FICs required to managed similar scenarios. For more information, see: [Flexible federated identity credentials (preview)](../workload-id/workload-identities-flexible-federated-identity-credentials.md).

### General Availability - Real-time Password Spray Detection in Microsoft Entra ID Protection

**Type:** New feature    
**Service category:** Identity Protection    
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection    

Traditionally, password spray attacks are detected post breach or as part of hunting activity. Now, we’ve enhanced Microsoft Entra ID Protection to detect password spray attacks in real-time before the attacker ever obtains a token. This reduces remediation from hours to seconds by interrupting attacks during the sign-in flow.

Risk-based Conditional Access can automatically respond to this new signal by raising session risk, immediately challenging the sign-in attempt, and stopping password spray attempts in their tracks. This cutting-edge detection, now Generally Available, works alongside existing detections for advanced attacks such as Adversary-in-the-Middle (AitM) phishing and token theft, to ensure comprehensive coverage against modern attacks. For more information, see: [What is Microsoft Entra ID Protection?](../id-protection/overview-identity-protection.md)

---

### General Availability - Protected actions for hard deletions

**Type:** New feature    
**Service category:** Other    
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection    

Customers can now configure Conditional Access policies to protect against early hard deletions. Protected action for hard deletion protects hard deletion of users, Microsoft 365 groups, and applications. For more information, see: [What are protected actions in Microsoft Entra ID?](../identity/role-based-access-control/protected-actions-overview.md)

---

### Deprecated - Action Required by February 1, 2025: Azure AD Graph retirement

**Type:** Deprecated    
**Service category:** Azure AD Graph    
**Product capability:** Developer Experience    

The Azure AD Graph API service was [deprecated] in 2020. [Retirement of the Azure AD Graph API service](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/june-2024-update-on-azure-ad-graph-api-retirement/ba-p/4094534) began in September 2024, and the next phase of this retirement starts February 1, 2025. This phase will impact new and existing applications unless action is taken. The latest updates on Azure AD Graph retirement can be found here: [Take action by February 1: Azure AD Graph is retiring](https://aka.ms/AzureADGraphRetirement).

Starting from February 1, both new and existing applications will be prevented from calling Azure AD Graph APIs, unless they're configured for an extension. You might not see impact right away, as we’re rolling out this change in stages across tenants. We anticipate full deployment of this change around the end of February, and by the end of March for national cloud deployments.

If you haven't already, it's now urgent to review the applications on your tenant to see which ones depend on Azure AD Graph API access, and mitigate or migrate these before the February 1 cutoff date. For applications that haven't migrated to Microsoft Graph APIs, [an extension](/graph/applications-authenticationbehaviors?tabs=http#allow-extended-azure-ad-graph-access-until-june-30-2025) can be set to allow the application access to Azure AD Graph through June 30, 2025.

Microsoft Entra Recommendations are the best tool to identify applications that are using Azure AD Graph APIs in your tenant and require action. Reference this blog post: Action required: [Azure AD Graph API retirement](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/identity/action-required-azure-ad-graph-api-retirement/4090533) for step by step guidance.

### General Availability - Microsoft Entra Connect Version 2.4.129.0

**Type:** Changed feature    
**Service category:** Microsoft Entra Connect    
**Product capability:** Microsoft Entra Connect    

On January 15, 2025, we released Microsoft Entra Connect Sync Version 2.4.129.0 which supports auditing administrator events. More details are available in the [release notes](../identity/hybrid/connect/reference-connect-version-history.md#241290). We'll automatically upgrade eligible customers to this latest version of Microsoft Entra Connect in February 2025. For customers who wish to be autoupgraded, [ensure that you have auto-upgrade configured](../identity/hybrid/connect/how-to-connect-install-automatic-upgrade.md).

### Deprecated - Take action to avoid impact when legacy MSOnline and AzureAD PowerShell modules retire

**Type:** Deprecated    
**Service category:** Legacy MSOnline and AzureAD PowerShell modules    
**Product capability:** Developer Experience    

As announced in Microsoft Entra [change announcements](https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ChangeManagementHubList.ReactView) and in the Microsoft Entra [Blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/identity/important-update-deprecation-of-azure-ad-powershell-and-msonline-powershell-modu/4094536), the MSOnline, and Microsoft Azure AD PowerShell modules (for Microsoft Entra ID) retired on March 30, 2024.

The retirement for MSOnline PowerShell module starts in early April 2025, and ends in late May 2025. If you're using MSOnline PowerShell, you must take action by March 30, 2025 to avoid impact after the retirement by migrating any use of MSOnline to [Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK](/powershell/microsoftgraph/installation) or [Microsoft Entra PowerShell](/powershell/entra-powershell/installation).

Key points

- MSOnline PowerShell will retire, and stop working, between early April 2025 and late May 2025
- AzureAD PowerShell will no longer be supported after March 30, 2025, but its retirement will happen in early July 2025. This postponement is to allow you time to finish the MSOnline PowerShell migration
- To ensure customer readiness for MSOnline PowerShell retirement, a series of temporary outage tests will occur for all tenants between January 2025 and March 2025.

For more information, see: [Action required: MSOnline and AzureAD PowerShell retirement - 2025 info and resources](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/identity/action-required-msonline-and-azuread-powershell-retirement---2025-info-and-resou/4364991).

### Public Preview - Microsoft Entra new store for certificate-based authentication

**Type:** New feature    
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)    
**Product capability:** User Authentication    

Microsoft Entra ID has a new scalable **PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) based CA** (Certificate Authorities) store with higher limits for the number of CAs and the size of each CA file. PKI based CA store allows CAs within each different PKI to be in its own container object allowing administrators to move away from one flat list of CAs to more efficient PKI container based CAs. PKI-based CA store now supports up to 250CAs, 8KB size for each CA and also supports issuers hints attribute for each CA. Administrators can also upload the entire PKI and all the CAs using the "Upload CBA PKI" feature or create a PKI container and upload CAs individually. For more information, see: [Step 1: Configure the certificate authorities with PKI-based trust store (Preview)](../identity/authentication/how-to-certificate-based-authentication.md#step-1-configure-the-certificate-authorities-with-pki-based-trust-store-preview).

### Changed feature - expansion of WhatsApp as an MFA one-time passcode delivery channel for Entra ID

**Type:** Changed feature    
**Service category:** MFA    
**Product capability:** User Authentication    

In late 2023, Entra started leveraging WhatsApp as an alternate channel to deliver multifactor authentication (MFA) one-time passcodes to users in India and Indonesia. We saw improved deliverability, completion rates, and satisfaction when leveraging the channel in both countries. The channel was temporarily disabled in India in early 2024. Starting early December 2024, we will be re-enabling the channel in India, and expanding its use to additional countries.

Starting December 2024, users in India, and other countries can start receiving MFA text messages via WhatsApp. Only users that are enabled to receive MFA text messages as an authentication method, and already have WhatsApp on their phone, will get this experience. If a user with WhatsApp on their device is unreachable or doesn’t have internet connectivity, we will quickly fall back to the regular SMS channel. In addition, users receiving OTPs via WhatsApp for the first time will be notified of the change in behavior via SMS text message. 

If you don’t want your users to receive MFA text messages through WhatsApp, you can disable text messages as an authentication method in your organization or scope it down to only be enabled for a subset of users. Please note that we highly encourage organizations move to using more modern, secure methods like Microsoft Authenticator and passkeys in favor of telecom and messaging app methods. For more information, see: [Text message verification](../identity/authentication/concept-authentication-phone-options.md#text-message-verification).

### Retirement - MFA Fraud Alert will be retired on March 1st 2025

**Type:** Deprecated    
**Service category:** MFA    
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection    

Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication (MFA) [fraud alert](../identity/authentication/howto-mfa-mfasettings.md#fraud-alert) allows end users to report MFA voice calls, and Microsoft Authenticator push requests, they didn't initiate as fraudulent. Beginning March 1, 2025, MFA Fraud Alert will be retired in favor of the replacement feature [Report Suspicious Activity](../identity/authentication/howto-mfa-mfasettings.md#report-suspicious-activity) which allows end users to report fraudulent requests, and is also integrated with [Identity Protection](../id-protection/overview-identity-protection.md) for more comprehensive coverage and remediation. To ensure users can continue reporting fraudulent MFA requests, organizations should migrate to using Report Suspicious Activity, and review how reported activity is remediated based on their Microsoft Entra licensing. For more information, see: [Configure Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication settings](../identity/authentication/howto-mfa-mfasettings.md).

### Public Preview - Microsoft Entra Health Monitoring, Alerts Feature

**Type:** Changed feature    
**Service category:** Other    
**Product capability:** Monitoring & Reporting    

Intelligent alerts in Microsoft Entra health monitoring notify tenant admins, and security engineers, whenever a monitored scenario breaks from its typical pattern. Microsoft Entra's alerting capability watches the low-latency health signals of each scenario, and fires a notification in the event of an anomaly. The set of alert-ready health signals and scenarios will grow over time. This alerts feature is now available in Microsoft Entra Health as an API-only public preview release (UX release is scheduled for February 2025). For more information, see: [How to use Microsoft Entra Health monitoring alerts (preview)](../identity/monitoring-health/howto-use-health-scenario-alerts.md).

### General Availability - Log analytics sign-in logs schema is in parity with MSGraph schema

**Type:** Plan for change    
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)    
**Product capability:** Monitoring & Reporting    

To maintain consistency in our core logging principles, we've addressed a legacy parity issue where the Azure Log Analytics sign-in logs schema did not align with the MSGraph sign-in logs schema. The updates include fields such as ClientCredentialType, CreatedDateTime, ManagedServiceIdentity, NetworkLocationDetails, tokenProtectionStatus, SessionID, among others. These changes will take effect in the first week of December 2024.

We believe this enhancement will provide a more consistent logging experience. As always, you can perform pre-ingestion transformations to remove any unwanted data from your Azure Log Analytics storage workspaces. For guidance on how to perform these transformations, see: [Data collection transformations in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/data-collection-transformations).

Admins can now require attestation during registration of a passkey, and Android native apps now supports signing in with passkeys in the Authenticator. Additionally, users are now prompted to sign in to the Authenticator app to register a passkey when initiating the flow from MySignIns. The Authenticator app passkey registration wizard walks the user through meeting all the prerequisites within the context of the app before attempting registration. Download the latest version of the Authenticator app and give us feedback as you pilot these changes in your organization.

### Public Preview - Authentication methods migration wizard

**Type:** New feature    
**Service category:** MFA    
**Product capability:** User Authentication    

The authentication methods migration guide (preview) in the Microsoft Entra admin center lets you automatically migrate method management from the [legacy MFA and SSPR policies](../identity/authentication/concept-authentication-methods-manage.md#legacy-mfa-and-sspr-policies) to the [converged authentication methods policy](../identity/authentication/concept-authentication-methods-manage.md). In 2023, it was announced that the ability to manage authentication methods in the legacy MFA and SSPR policies would be retired in September 2025. Until now, organizations had to manually migrate methods themselves by leveraging [the migration toggle](../identity/authentication/how-to-authentication-methods-manage.md#start-the-migration) in the converged policy. Now, you can migrate in just a few selections by using the migration guide. The guide evaluates what your organization currently has enabled in both legacy policies, and generates a recommended converged policy configuration for you to review and edit as needed. From there, simply confirm the configuration and we set it up for you and mark your migration as complete. For more information, see: [How to migrate MFA and SSPR policy settings to the Authentication methods policy for Microsoft Entra ID](../identity/authentication/how-to-authentication-methods-manage.md).

### Public preview - New Conditional Access Template Requiring Device Compliance 

**Type:** New feature    
**Service category:** Conditional Access    
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection    

A new Conditional Access template requiring device compliance is now available in Public Preview. This template restricts access to company resources exclusively to devices enrolled in mobile device management (MDM) and compliant with company policy. Requiring device compliance improves data security, reducing risk of data breaches, malware infections, and unauthorized access. This is a recommended best practice for users and devices targeted by compliance policy through MDM. For more information, see: [Common policy: Create a Conditional Access policy requiring device compliance.](../identity/conditional-access/policy-all-users-device-compliance.md)

### Public preview - Tenant admin can fail certificate based auth when the end user certificate issuer isn't configured with a certificate revocation list

**Type:** New feature    
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)    
**Product capability:** User Authentication    

With Certificate based authentication, a CA can be uploaded without a CRL endpoint, and certificate-based authentication won't fail if an issuing CA doesn't have a CRL specified.

To strengthen security and avoid misconfigurations, an Authentication Policy Administrator can require CBA authentication to fail if no CRL is configured for a CA that issues an end user certificate. For more information, see: [Understanding CRL validation (Preview)](../identity/authentication/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive.md#understanding-crl-validation-preview).

### Public Preview - Custom Claims API for Claims Configuration of Enterprise Apps

**Type:** New feature    
**Service category:** Enterprise Apps    
**Product capability:** SSO    

Custom Claims API allows admins to manage and update additional claims for their Enterprise Applications seamlessly through MS Graph. The Custom Claims API offers a simplified and user friendly API experience for claims management for our customers. With the introduction of Custom Claims API, we achieved UX and API interoperability. Admins can now use Microsoft Entra admin center and MS Graph API interchangeably to manage claims configurations for their Enterprise Applications. It facilitates admins to execute their automations using the API while allowing the flexibility to update claims on the Microsoft Entra admin center as required on the same policy object. For more information, see: [Customize claims using Microsoft Graph Custom Claims Policy (preview)](../identity-platform/claims-customization-custom-claims-policy.md).

### Public Preview - Request on behalf of

**Type:** New feature    
**Service category:** Entitlement Management    
**Product capability:** Entitlement Management    

Entitlement Management enables admins to create access packages to manage their organization’s resources. Admins can either directly assign users to an access package, or configure an access package policy that allows users and group members to request access. This option to create self-service processes is useful, especially as organizations scale and hire more employees. However, new employees joining an organization might not always know what they need access to, or how they can request access. In this case, a new employee would likely rely on their manager to guide them through the access request process.

Instead of having new employees navigate the request process, managers can request access packages for their employees, making onboarding faster and more seamless. To enable this functionality for managers, admins can select an option when setting up an access package policy that allows managers to request access on their employees' behalf.

Expanding self-service request flows to allow requests on behalf of employees ensures that users have timely access to necessary resources, and increases productivity. For more information, see: [Request access package on-behalf-of other users (Preview)](../id-governance/entitlement-management-request-behalf.md).

## August 2024

### Change announcement - Upcoming MFA Enforcement on Microsoft Entra admin center

**Type:** Plan for change     
**Service category:** MFA   
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection    

As part of our commitment to providing our customers with the highest level of security, we previously [announced](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/core-infrastructure-and-security/update-on-mfa-requirements-for-azure-sign-in/ba-p/4177584) that Microsoft requires multifactor authentication (MFA) for users signing into Azure.

We'd like to share an update that the scope of MFA enforcement includes [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/) in addition to the Azure portal and Intune admin center. This change is rolled out in phases, allowing organizations time to plan their implementation:

**Phase 1**: Beginning in the second half of the calendar year 2024, MFA is required to sign in to the Microsoft Entra admin center, Azure portal, and Intune admin center. This enforcement is gradually rolled out to all tenants worldwide. This phase didn't affect other Azure clients such as the Azure Command Line Interface, Azure PowerShell, Azure mobile app, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools.

**Phase 2**: Beginning in early 2025, gradual enforcement of MFA at sign-in for the Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, Azure mobile app, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools commences.

Microsoft sends a 60-day advance notice to all Microsoft Entra Global Administrators by email, and through Azure Service Health Notifications, to notify them of the start date of enforcement and required actions. Extra notifications are sent through the Azure portal, Microsoft Entra admin center, and the Microsoft 365 message center.

We understand that some customers might need extra time to prepare for this MFA requirement. Therefore, Microsoft allows extended time for customers with complex environments or technical barriers. The notification from us also includes details about how customers can postpone specific changes. These changes include the start date of enforcement for their tenants, the duration of the postponement, and a link to apply changes. Visit [here](../identity/authentication/concept-mandatory-multifactor-authentication.md) to learn more.

### General Availability - restricted permissions on Directory Synchronization Accounts (DSA) role in Microsoft Entra Connect Sync and Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync

**Type:** Changed feature     
**Service category:** Provisioning   
**Product capability:** Microsoft Entra Connects    

As part of ongoing security hardening, Microsoft removes unused permissions from the privileged *Directory Synchronization Accounts* role. This role is exclusively used by Microsoft Entra Connect Sync, and Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync, to synchronize Active Directory objects with Microsoft Entra ID. There's no action required by customers to benefit from this hardening, and the revised role permissions are documented here: [Directory Synchronization Accounts](../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#directory-synchronization-accounts).

### Plan for change - My Security-Info Add sign-in method picker UX update

**Type:** Plan for change     
**Service category:** MFA   
**Product capability:** End User Experiences    

Starting Mid-October 2024, the *Add sign-in* method dialog on the My Security-Info page will be updated with a modern look and feel. With this change, new descriptors will be added under each method which provides detail to users on how the sign-in method is used (ex. *Microsoft Authenticator – Approve sign-in requests* or *use one-time codes*).  

Early next year the *Add sign-in* method, dialog will be enhanced to show an initially recommended sign-in method instead of initially showing the full list of sign-in methods available to register. The recommended sign-in method will default to the strongest method available to the user based on the organization’s authentication method policy. Users can select *Show more options* and choose from all available sign-in methods allowed by their policy.

This change will occur automatically, so admins take no action.

**Service category:** Identity Protection        
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection        

The *Suspicious sending patterns* risk detection type is discovered using information provided by Microsoft Defender for Office (MDO).

## December 2023

### Public Preview - Configurable redemption order for B2B collaboration

**Type:** New feature   
**Service category:** B2B                     
**Product capability:**  B2B/B2C             

With configurable redemption, you can customize the order of identity providers that your guest users can sign in with when they accept your invitation. This lets your override the default configuration order set by Microsoft and use your own. This can be used to help with scenarios like prioritizing a SAML/WS-fed federation above an Microsoft Entra ID verified domain, disabling certain identity providers as an option during redemption, or even only using something like email one-time pass-code as a redemption option. For more information, see: [Configurable redemption (Preview)](../external-id/cross-tenant-access-overview.md#configurable-redemption-preview).

---

### General Availability - Edits to Dynamic Group Rule Builder

**Type:** Changed feature   
**Service category:** Group Management                     
**Product capability:**  Directory             

The dynamic group rule builder is updated to no longer include the '*contains*' and '*notContains*' operators, as they're less performant. If needed, you can still create dynamic group rules with those operators by typing directly into the text box. For more information, see: [Rule builder in the Azure portal](../identity/users/groups-dynamic-membership.md#rule-builder-in-the-azure-portal).

## November 2023

### Decommissioning of Group Writeback V2 (Public Preview) in Entra Connect Sync

**Type:** Plan for change   
**Service category:** Provisioning                     
**Product capability:**  Microsoft Entra Connect Sync             

The public preview of Group Writeback V2 (GWB) in Entra Connect Sync will no longer be available after June 30, 2024. After this date, Connect Sync will no longer support provisioning cloud security groups to Active Directory.

Another similar functionality is offered in Entra Cloud Sync, called “*Group Provision to AD*”, that maybe used instead of GWB V2 for provisioning cloud security groups to AD. Enhanced functionality in Cloud Sync, along with other new features, are being developed.

Customers who use this preview feature in Connect Sync should [switch their configuration from Connect Sync to Cloud Sync](../identity/hybrid/cloud-sync/migrate-group-writeback.md). Customers can choose to move all their hybrid sync to Cloud Sync (if it supports their needs) or Cloud Sync can be run side-by-side and move only cloud security group provisioning to AD onto Cloud Sync.

Customers who provision Microsoft 365 groups to AD can continue using GWB V1 for this capability.  

Customers can evaluate moving exclusively to Cloud Sync by using this wizard: https://aka.ms/EvaluateSyncOptions

### General Availability - Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync now supports ability to enable Exchange Hybrid configuration for Exchange customers

**Type:** New feature   
**Service category:** Provisioning                     
**Product capability:**  Microsoft Entra Connect            

Exchange hybrid capability allows for the coexistence of Exchange mailboxes both on-premises and in Microsoft 365. Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync synchronizes a specific set of Exchange-related attributes from Microsoft Entra ID back into your on-premises directory and to any forests that's disconnected (no network trust needed between them). With this capability, existing customers who have this feature enabled in Microsoft Entra Connect sync can now migrate, and apply, this feature with Microsoft Entra cloud sync. For more information, see: [Exchange hybrid writeback with cloud sync](../identity/hybrid/exchange-hybrid-writeback.md).

---

### General Availability - Guest Governance: Inactive Guest Insights

**Type:** New feature   
**Service category:** Reporting                     
**Product capability:**  Identity Governance             

Monitor guest accounts at scale with intelligent insights into inactive guest users in your organization. Customize the inactivity threshold depending on your organization’s needs, narrow down the scope of guest users you want to monitor, and identify the guest users that might be inactive. For more information, see: [Monitor and clean up stale guest accounts using access reviews](../identity/users/clean-up-stale-guest-accounts.md).

---

### Public Preview - lastSuccessfulSignIn property in signInActivity API

**Type:** New feature   
**Service category:** MS Graph                     
**Product capability:**  End User Experiences             

An extra property has been added to signInActivity API to display the last **successful** sign in time for a specific user, regardless if the sign in was interactive or non-interactive. The data won't be backfilled for this property, so you should expect to be returned only successful sign in data starting on December 8, 2023.

---

### General Availability - Auto-rollout of Conditional Access policies

**Type:** New feature   
**Service category:** Conditional Access                     
**Product capability:**  Access Control             

Starting in November 2023, Microsoft will begin automatically protecting customers with Microsoft managed Conditional Access policies. These are policies that Microsoft creates and enables in customer tenants. The following policies are rolled out to all eligible tenants, who will be notified prior to policy creation :

1. Multifactor authentication for admin portals: This policy covers privileged admin roles and requires multifactor authentication when an admin signs into a Microsoft admin portal.
1. Multifactor authentication for per-user multifactor authentication users: This policy covers users with per-user multifactor authentication and requires multifactor authentication for all cloud apps.
1. Multifactor authentication for high-risk sign-ins: This policy covers all users and requires multifactor authentication and reauthentication for high-risk sign-ins.

For more information, see:

- [Automatic Conditional Access policies in Microsoft Entra streamline identity protection](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2023/11/06/automatic-conditional-access-policies-in-microsoft-entra-streamline-identity-protection/)

**Type:** New feature   
**Service category:** Directory Management                     
**Product capability:**  Directory             

Custom security attributes in Microsoft Entra ID are business-specific attributes (key-value pairs) that you can define and assign to Microsoft Entra objects. These attributes can be used to store information, categorize objects, or enforce fine-grained access control over specific Azure resources. Custom security attributes can be used with [Azure attribute-based access control (Azure ABAC)](/azure/role-based-access-control/conditions-overview). For more information, see: [What are custom security attributes in Microsoft Entra ID?](./custom-security-attributes-overview.md).

Changes were made to custom security attribute audit logs for general availability that might impact your daily operations. If you have been using custom security attribute audit logs during the preview, there are the actions you must take before February 2024 to ensure your audit log operations aren't disrupted. For more information, see: [Custom security attribute audit logs](./custom-security-attributes-manage.md#custom-security-attribute-audit-logs).

### Public Preview - Managing and Changing Passwords in My Security Info 

**Type:** New feature   
**Service category:** My Profile/Account                     
**Product capability:** End User Experiences            

My Sign Ins ([My Sign-Ins (microsoft.com)](https://mysignins.microsoft.com/)) now supports end users managing and changing their passwords. Administrators are able to use Conditional Access registration policies with authentication strengths targeting My Security Info to control the end user experience for changing passwords.

### General Availability - Microsoft Security email update and Resources for Azure AD rename to Microsoft Entra ID 

**Type:** Plan for change   
**Service category:** Other

### General Availability - Restrict Microsoft Entra ID Tenant Creation To Only Paid Subscription  

**Type:** Changed feature   
**Service category:** Managed identities for Azure resources                    
**Product capability:** End User Experiences            

The ability to create new tenants from the Microsoft Entra admin center allows users in your organization to create test and demo tenants from your Microsoft Entra ID tenant, [Learn more about creating tenants](/microsoft-365/education/deploy/intro-azure-active-directory). When used incorrectly this feature can allow the creation of tenants that aren't managed or viewable by your organization. We recommend that you restrict this capability so that only trusted admins can use this feature, [Learn more about restricting member users' default permissions](users-default-permissions.md#restrict-member-users-default-permissions). We also recommend you use the Microsoft Entra audit log to monitor for the Directory Management: Create Company event that signals a new tenant has been created by a user in your organization.  

To further protect your organization, Microsoft is now limiting this functionality to only paid customers. Customers on trial subscriptions won't be able to create additional tenants from the Microsoft Entra admin center. Customers in this situation who need a new trial tenant can sign up for a [Free Azure Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

---

### General Availability - Users can't modify GPS location when using location based access control

**Type:** Plan for change   
**Service category:** Conditional Access                     
**Product capability:** User Authentication            

In an ever-evolving security landscape, the Microsoft Authenticator is updating its security baseline for Location Based Access Control (LBAC) conditional access policies to disallow authentications where the user may be using a different location than the actual GPS location of the mobile device. Today, it's possible for users to modify the location reported by the device on iOS and Android devices. The Authenticator app will start to deny LBAC authentications where we detect that the user isn't using the actual location of the mobile device where the Authenticator is installed.

In the November 2023 release of the Authenticator app, users who are modifying the location of their device sees a denial message in the app when doing an LBAC authentication. To ensure that users aren’t using older app versions to continue authenticating with a modified location, beginning January 2024, any users that are on Android Authenticator 6.2309.6329 version or prior and iOS Authenticator version 6.7.16 or prior will be blocked from using LBAC. To determine which users are using older versions of the Authenticator app, you may use [our MSGraph APIs](/graph/api/resources/microsoftauthenticatorauthenticationmethod).

### Public Preview - Changes to FIDO2 authentication methods and Windows Hello for Business

**Type:**  Changed feature            
**Service category:**  Authentications (Logins)                                
**Product capability:**  User Authentication                        

Beginning **January 2024**, Microsoft Entra ID will support [device-bound passkeys](https://passkeys.dev/docs/reference/terms/#device-bound-passkey) stored on computers and mobile devices as an authentication method in public preview, in addition to the existing support for FIDO2 security keys. This enables your users to perform phishing-resistant authentication using the devices that they already have.  

We'll expand the existing FIDO2 authentication methods policy, and end user experiences, to support this preview release. For your organization to opt in to this preview, you'll need to enforce key restrictions to allow specified passkey providers in your FIDO2 policy. Learn more about FIDO2 key restrictions [here](~/identity/authentication/howto-authentication-passwordless-security-key.md).

In addition, the existing end user sign-in option for Windows Hello and FIDO2 security keys will be renamed to “*Face, fingerprint, PIN, or security key*”. The term “passkey” will be mentioned in the updated sign-in experience to be inclusive of passkey credentials presented from security keys, computers, and mobile devices.

### General Availability - Web Sign-In for Windows

**Type:** Changed feature              
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)                                 
**Product capability:** User Authentication    

We're thrilled to announce that as part of the Windows 11 September moment, we're releasing a new Web Sign-In experience that will expand the number of supported scenarios and greatly improve security, reliability, performance, and overall end-to-end experience for our users.

Web Sign-In (WSI) is a credential provider on the Windows lock/sign-in screen for AADJ joined devices that provide a web experience used for authentication and returns an auth token back to the operating system to allow the user to unlock/sign-in to the machine.

Web Sign-In was initially intended to be used for a wide range of auth credential scenarios; however, it was only previously released for limited scenarios such as: [Simplified EDU Web Sign-In](/education/windows/federated-sign-in?tabs=intune) and recovery flows via [Temporary Access Password (TAP)](~/identity/authentication/howto-authentication-temporary-access-pass.md).

The underlying provider for Web Sign-In has been re-written from the ground up with security and improved performance in mind. This release moves the Web Sign-in infrastructure from the Cloud Host Experience (CHX) WebApp to a newly written Login Web Host (LWH) for the September moment. This release provides better security and reliability to support previous EDU & TAP experiences and new workflows enabling using various Auth Methods to unlock/login to the desktop.

**Type:** New feature         
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)                              
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection                    

**Tenant Restrictions V2 (TRv2)** is now generally available for authentication plane via proxy.  

TRv2 allows organizations to enable safe and productive cross-company collaboration while containing data exfiltration risk. With TRv2, you can control what external tenants your users can access from your devices or network using externally issued identities and provide granular access control on a per org, user, group, and application basis.    

TRv2 uses the cross-tenant access policy, and offers both authentication and data plane protection. It enforces policies during user authentication, and on data plane access with Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, Teams, and MSGraph.  While the data plane support with Windows GPO and Global Secure Access is still in public preview, authentication plane support with proxy is now generally available.

## August 2025

### Plan for change - New end user homepage in My Account

**Type:** New feature      
**Service category:** My Profile/Account     
**Product capability:** End User Experiences  

By the end of September 2025, the homepage at https://myaccount.microsoft.com will be updated to provide a more task-focused experience. Users will see pending actions like renewing expiring groups, approving access package requests, and setting up MFA directly on the homepage. Quick links to apps, groups, access packages, and sign-in details will be easier to find and use. This change is designed to streamline account management and help users stay on top of access and security tasks.

### Plan for change  - Requestors can view who their access package approvers are in My Access

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Entitlement Management     
**Product capability:** Entitlement Management  

By the end of September 2025, requestors will be able to see the name and email address of approvers for their pending access package requests directly in the My Access portal. This feature improves transparency and helps streamline communication between requestors and approvers. At the tenant level, approver visibility is enabled by default for all members (non-guests) and can be controlled through the Entitlement Management settings in the Microsoft Entra Admin Center. At the access package level, admins and access package owners can configure the approver visibility and choose to override the tenant level setting under the advanced request settings in the access package policy.

### Public Preview - Externally determine the approval requirements for an access package using custom extensions

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Entitlement Management     
**Product capability:** Entitlement Management  

In Entitlement Management, approvers for access package assignment requests can either be directly assigned, or determined dynamically. Entitlement management natively supports dynamically determining approvers such as the requestors manager, their second-level manager, or a sponsor from a connected organization. With the introduction of this feature you can now use custom extensions for callouts to Azure Logic Apps and dynamically determine approval requirements for each access package assignment request based on your organizations specific business logic. The access package assignment request process will pause until your business logic hosted in Azure Logic Apps returns an approval stage which will then be leveraged in the subsequent approval process via the My Access portal. 

For more information, see: [Externally determine the approval requirements for an access package using custom extensions (Preview)](../id-governance/entitlement-management-dynamic-approval.md).

### Public Preview - Convert Source of Authority of synced Active Directory groups to the cloud

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Group Management  
**Product capability:** Microsoft Entra Connect and Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync

The Source of Authority (SOA) at the object level allows administrators to convert specific groups synced from Active Directory (AD) to Microsoft Entra ID into cloud-editable objects, which are no longer synced from AD and act as if originally created in the cloud. This feature supports a gradual migration process, decreasing dependencies on AD while aiming to minimize user and operational impact. Both Entra Connect Sync and Cloud Sync recognize the SOA switch for these objects. Additionally, administrators can govern Kerberos-based applications associated with AD security groups from the cloud using Microsoft Entra Governance by including these SOA-converted security groups for Group Provision to AD. The option to switch the SOA of synced groups from AD to Microsoft Entra ID is currently available in Public Preview. For more information, see: [Embrace cloud-first posture: Convert Group Source of Authority to the cloud (Preview)](../identity/hybrid/concept-source-of-authority-overview.md).

## June 2025
 
### General Availability – Update to Microsoft Entra Work or School Default Background Image 
 
**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** Authentications (Login)  
**Product capability:** User Authentication  
 
Starting September 29, 2025, we'll be making a change to the default background image of our Microsoft Entra work or school authentication screens. This new background was designed to help users focus on signing into their accounts, enhancing productivity, and minimizing distractions. With this, we aim to ensure visual consistency and a clean, simplified user experience throughout Microsoft’s authentication flows – aligning with Microsoft’s modernized [Fluent](https://microsoft.design/articles/four-principles-for-the-future-of-design/) design language. When our experiences look and feel consistent, it gives our users a familiar experience that they know and trust. 

**What’s changing?**                                                   		           

This update is solely a visual user interface refresh with no changes to functionality. This change will only affect screens where [Company Branding](how-to-customize-branding.md) doesn't apply or where users see the [default background image](https://aka.ms/entradefaultbackground). We recommend updating any documentation that contains screenshots and notifying your help desk. If you have configured a custom background image in Company Branding for your tenant, there will be no change for your users. 

**Additional Details:** 

1. **Tenants without a custom background configured:**  
    a. Tenants without a custom background will see the change on every authentication screen.<br> 
    b. To change this background and use a custom background, configure [Company Branding](how-to-customize-branding.md).

1. **Tenants with a custom background configured:**  
    a. Tenants with a custom background configured will only see the change wherever the URL doesn't have a specified tenant ID parameter (For example, login.microsoftonline.com directly **without** a domain hint or custom URL).<br> 
    b. For all other screens, tenants with a custom background configured **will see no change** to their experience on all clients. 

1. **Entra External ID Tenants will not see any change to their experience on all clients** 

**What do you need to do?**

No action is required. The update will be applied automatically starting September 29, 2025.

### Public Preview - Roll out of Application Based Authentication on Microsoft Entra Connect Sync

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Microsoft Entra Connect  
**Product capability:** Microsoft Entra Connect  

Microsoft Entra Connect creates and uses a [Microsoft Entra Connector account](../identity/hybrid/connect/reference-connect-accounts-permissions.md) to authenticate and sync identities from Active Directory to Microsoft Entra ID. The account uses a locally stored password to authenticate with Microsoft Entra ID. To enhance the security of the Microsoft Entra Connect sync process with the application, we've rolled out support for "*Application based Authentication" (ABA)*, which uses a Microsoft Entra ID application identity and Oauth 2.0 client credential flow to authenticate with Microsoft Entra ID. To enable this, Microsoft Entra Connect creates a single tenant 3rd party application in the customer's Microsoft Entra ID tenant, registers a certificate as the credential for the application, and authorizes the application to perform on-premises directory synchronization. 

The Microsoft Entra Connect Sync .msi installation file for this change is exclusively available on Microsoft Entra Admin Center within the [Microsoft Entra Connect pane](https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_Connect_Provisioning/AADConnectMenuBlade/~/GetStarted).

This eliminates the need to store and manage client secrets or certificates when using Microsoft Entra app to access Azure resources across tenants. This capability aligns with Microsoft’s [Secure Future Initiative](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center/security/secure-future-initiative) pillar of protecting identities and secrets across systems. Learn how to configure this capability in the [official documentation](../workload-id/workload-identity-federation-config-app-trust-managed-identity.md).

### Plan for change - Roll out of Application Based Authentication on Microsoft Entra Connect Sync

**Type:** Plan for change   
**Service category:** Microsoft Entra Connect    
**Product capability:** Microsoft Entra Connect    

**What is changing**

Microsoft Entra Connect creates and uses a [Microsoft Entra Connector account](../identity/hybrid/connect/reference-connect-accounts-permissions.md) to authenticate and sync identities from Active Directory to Microsoft Entra ID. The account uses a locally stored password to authenticate with Microsoft Entra ID. To enhance the security of the Microsoft Entra Connect application sync process, we will, in the coming week roll out support for "Application based Authentication" (ABA), which uses a Microsoft Entra ID application based identity and Oauth 2.0 client credential flow to authenticate with Microsoft Entra ID. To enable this, Microsoft Entra Connect will create a single tenant 3rd party application in customer's Microsoft Entra ID tenant, register a certificate as the credential for the application, and authorize the application to perform on-premises directory synchronization

The Microsoft Entra Connect Sync .msi installation file for this change will be exclusively available in the Microsoft Entra admin center within the [Microsoft Entra Connect pane](https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_Connect_Provisioning/AADConnectMenuBlade/~/GetStarted). 

Check our [version history page](../identity/hybrid/connect/reference-connect-version-history.md) in the next week for more details of the change.

### Microsoft Entra Permissions Management end of sale and retirement
 
**Type:** Plan for change    
**Service category:** Other    
**Product capability:** Permissions Management    
 
Effective April 1, 2025, Microsoft Entra Permissions Management (MEPM) will no longer be available for sale to new Enterprise Agreement or direct customers. Additionally, starting May 1, it will not be available for sale to new CSP customers. Effective October 1, 2025, we will retire Microsoft Entra Permissions Management and discontinue support of this product. 

Existing customers will retain access to this product until September 30, 2025, with ongoing support for current functionalities. We have partnered with Delinea to provide an alternative solution, [Privilege Control for Cloud Entitlements (PCCE)](https://delinea.com/products/privilege-control-for-cloud-entitlements), that offers similar capabilities to those provided by Microsoft Entra Permissions Management. The decision to phase out Microsoft Entra Permissions Management was done after deep consideration of our innovation portfolio and how we can focus on delivering the best innovations aligned to our differentiating areas and partner with the ecosystem on adjacencies. We remain committed to delivering top-tier solutions across the Microsoft Entra portfolio. For more information, see: [Important change announcement: Microsoft Entra Permissions Management end of sale and retirement](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft-entra-blog/important-change-announcement-microsoft-entra-permissions-management-end-of-sale/4399382).

### Public Preview - Track and investigate identity activities with linkable identifiers in Microsoft Entra

**Type:** New feature    
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)    
**Product capability:** User Authentication    

Microsoft will standardize the linkable token identifiers, and expose them in both Microsoft Entra and workflow audit logs. This allows customers to join the logs to track, and investigate, any malicious activity. Currently linkable identifiers are available in Microsoft Entra sign in logs, Exchange Online audit logs, and MSGraph Activity logs.

For more information, see: [Track and investigate identity activities with linkable identifiers in Microsoft Entra (preview)](../identity/authentication/how-to-authentication-track-linkable-identifiers.md).

### General Availability- Conditional Access reauthentication policy 

**Type:** New feature    
**Service category:** Conditional Access    
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection    

Require reauthentication every time can be used for scenarios where you want to require a fresh authentication, every time a user performs specific actions like accessing sensitive applications, securing resources behind VPN, or Securing privileged role elevation in PIM​. For more information, see: [Require reauthentication every time](../identity/conditional-access/concept-session-lifetime.md#require-reauthentication-every-time).

### General Availability- Custom Attributes support for Microsoft Entra Domain Services

**Type:** New feature    
**Service category:** Microsoft Entra Domain Services    
**Product capability:** Microsoft Entra Domain Services    

Custom Attributes for Microsoft Entra Domain Services is now Generally Available. This capability allows customers to use Custom Attributes in their managed domains. Legacy applications often rely on custom attributes created in the past to store information, categorize objects, or enforce fine-grained access control over resources. For example, these applications might use custom attributes to store an employee ID in their directory and rely on these attributes in their application LDAP calls. Modifying legacy applications can be costly and risky, and customers might lack the necessary skills or knowledge to make these changes. Microsoft Entra Domain Services now supports custom attributes, enabling customers to migrate their legacy applications to the Azure cloud without modification. It also provides support to synchronize custom attributes from Microsoft Entra ID, allowing customers to benefit from Microsoft Entra ID services in the cloud. For more information, see: [Custom attributes for Microsoft Entra Domain Services](../identity/domain-services/concepts-custom-attributes.md).

### Public Preview - Limit creation or promotion of multitenant apps

**Type:** New feature    
**Service category:** Directory Management    
**Product capability:** Developer Experience    

A new feature has been added to the [App Management Policy Framework](/graph/api/resources/applicationauthenticationmethodpolicy?view=graph-rest-beta) that allows restriction on creation or promotion of multitenant applications, providing administrators with greater control over their app environments.

Administrators can now configure tenant default or custom app policy using the new '[audiences](/graph/api/resources/applicationauthenticationmethodpolicy?view=graph-rest-beta#what-restrictions-can-be-managed-in-microsoft-graph)' restriction to block new app creation if the signInAudience value provided in the app isn't permitted by the policy. In addition, existing apps can be restricted from changing their signInAudience if the target value isn't permitted by the policy. These policy changes are applied during app creation or update operations, offering control over application deployment and usage. For more information, see: [audiencesConfiguration resource type](/graph/api/resources/audiencesconfiguration).

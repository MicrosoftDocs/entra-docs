## June 2025
 
### General Availability – Update to Microsoft Entra Work or School Default Background Image 
 
**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** Authentications (Login)  
**Product capability:** User Authentication  
 
Starting September 29, 2025, we'll be making a change to the default background image of our Microsoft Entra work or school authentication screens. This new background was designed to help users focus on signing into their accounts, enhancing productivity, and minimizing distractions. With this, we aim to ensure visual consistency and a clean, simplified user experience throughout Microsoft’s authentication flows – aligning with Microsoft’s modernized [Fluent](https://microsoft.design/articles/four-principles-for-the-future-of-design/) design language. When our experiences look and feel consistent, it gives our users a familiar experience that they know and trust. 

**What’s changing?**                                                   		           

This update is solely a visual user interface refresh with no changes to functionality. This change will only affect screens where [Company Branding](how-to-customize-branding.md) doesn't apply or where users see the [default background image](https://aka.ms/entradefaultbackground). We recommend updating any documentation that contains screenshots and notifying your help desk. If you have configured a custom background image in Company Branding for your tenant, there will be no change for your users. 

**Additional Details:** 

1. **Tenants without a custom background configured:**  
    a. Tenants without a custom background will see the change on every authentication screen.<br> 
    b. To change this background and use a custom background, configure [Company Branding](how-to-customize-branding.md).

1. **Tenants with a custom background configured:**  
    a. Tenants with a custom background configured will only see the change wherever the URL doesn't have a specified tenant ID parameter (For example, login.microsoftonline.com directly **without** a domain hint or custom URL).<br> 
    b. For all other screens, tenants with a custom background configured **will see no change** to their experience on all clients. 

1. **Entra External ID Tenants will not see any change to their experience on all clients** 

**What do you need to do?**

No action is required. The update will be applied automatically starting September 29, 2025.

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Authentications (Login)   
**Product capability:** User Authentication  
 
CRL Fail Safe ensures that CBA auth fails if the end user certificate issuing CA does not have a Certificate Revocation List (CRL) configured. This closes a critical security gap where certificates could previously be accepted without revocation validation. Admins can enable this at the tenant level and configure exceptions for specific CAs as needed. For more information, see: [Understanding CRL validation](../identity/authentication/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive.md#understanding-crl-validation).
 
---

### Public Preview - Certificate Authority (CA) Scoping
 
**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Authentications (Login)   
**Product capability:** User Authentication 
 
CA Scoping allows admins to bind specific CAs to defined user groups. This ensures that users can only authenticate using certificates from trusted sources scoped to them. This enhances compliance, and reduces exposure to mis-issued or rogue certificates. For more information, see: [Certificate Authority (CA) Scoping (Preview)](../identity/authentication/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive.md#certificate-authority-ca-scoping-preview).

### Public Preview - Roll out of Application Based Authentication on Microsoft Entra Connect Sync

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Microsoft Entra Connect  
**Product capability:** Microsoft Entra Connect  

Microsoft Entra Connect creates and uses a [Microsoft Entra Connector account](../identity/hybrid/connect/reference-connect-accounts-permissions.md) to authenticate and sync identities from Active Directory to Microsoft Entra ID. The account uses a locally stored password to authenticate with Microsoft Entra ID. To enhance the security of the Microsoft Entra Connect sync process with the application, we've rolled out support for "*Application based Authentication" (ABA)*, which uses a Microsoft Entra ID application identity and Oauth 2.0 client credential flow to authenticate with Microsoft Entra ID. To enable this, Microsoft Entra Connect creates a single tenant 3rd party application in the customer's Microsoft Entra ID tenant, registers a certificate as the credential for the application, and authorizes the application to perform on-premises directory synchronization. 

The Microsoft Entra Connect Sync .msi installation file for this change is exclusively available on Microsoft Entra Admin Center within the [Microsoft Entra Connect pane](https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_Connect_Provisioning/AADConnectMenuBlade/~/GetStarted).

### Plan for change - Roll out of Application Based Authentication on Microsoft Entra Connect Sync

**Type:** Plan for change   
**Service category:** Microsoft Entra Connect    
**Product capability:** Microsoft Entra Connect    

**What is changing**

Microsoft Entra Connect creates and uses a [Microsoft Entra Connector account](../identity/hybrid/connect/reference-connect-accounts-permissions.md) to authenticate and sync identities from Active Directory to Microsoft Entra ID. The account uses a locally stored password to authenticate with Microsoft Entra ID. To enhance the security of the Microsoft Entra Connect application sync process, we will, in the coming week roll out support for "Application based Authentication" (ABA), which uses a Microsoft Entra ID application based identity and Oauth 2.0 client credential flow to authenticate with Microsoft Entra ID. To enable this, Microsoft Entra Connect will create a single tenant 3rd party application in customer's Microsoft Entra ID tenant, register a certificate as the credential for the application, and authorize the application to perform on-premises directory synchronization

The Microsoft Entra Connect Sync .msi installation file for this change will be exclusively available in the Microsoft Entra admin center within the [Microsoft Entra Connect pane](https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_Connect_Provisioning/AADConnectMenuBlade/~/GetStarted). 

Check our [version history page](../identity/hybrid/connect/reference-connect-version-history.md) in the next week for more details of the change.

### Public Preview - Track and investigate identity activities with linkable identifiers in Microsoft Entra

**Type:** New feature    
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)    
**Product capability:** User Authentication    

Microsoft will standardize the linkable token identifiers, and expose them in both Microsoft Entra and workflow audit logs. This allows customers to join the logs to track, and investigate, any malicious activity. Currently linkable identifiers are available in Microsoft Entra sign in logs, Exchange Online audit logs, and MSGraph Activity logs.

For more information, see: [Track and investigate identity activities with linkable identifiers in Microsoft Entra (preview)](../identity/authentication/how-to-authentication-track-linkable-identifiers.md).

### General Availability- Custom Attributes support for Microsoft Entra Domain Services

**Type:** New feature    
**Service category:** Microsoft Entra Domain Services    
**Product capability:** Microsoft Entra Domain Services    

Custom Attributes for Microsoft Entra Domain Services is now Generally Available. This capability allows customers to use Custom Attributes in their managed domains. Legacy applications often rely on custom attributes created in the past to store information, categorize objects, or enforce fine-grained access control over resources. For example, these applications might use custom attributes to store an employee ID in their directory and rely on these attributes in their application LDAP calls. Modifying legacy applications can be costly and risky, and customers might lack the necessary skills or knowledge to make these changes. Microsoft Entra Domain Services now supports custom attributes, enabling customers to migrate their legacy applications to the Azure cloud without modification. It also provides support to synchronize custom attributes from Microsoft Entra ID, allowing customers to benefit from Microsoft Entra ID services in the cloud. For more information, see: [Custom attributes for Microsoft Entra Domain Services](../identity/domain-services/concepts-custom-attributes.md).

## February 2025

### General Availability - Authentication methods migration wizard

**Type:** New feature    
**Service category:** MFA    
**Product capability:** User Authentication    

The authentication methods migration guide in the Microsoft Entra Admin Center lets you automatically migrate method management from the [legacy MFA and SSPR policies](../identity/authentication/concept-authentication-methods-manage.md#legacy-mfa-and-sspr-policies) to the [converged authentication methods policy](../identity/authentication/concept-authentication-methods-manage.md). In 2023, it was announced that the ability to manage authentication methods in the legacy MFA and SSPR policies would be retired in September 2025. Until now, organizations had to manually migrate methods themselves by using [the migration toggle](../identity/authentication/how-to-authentication-methods-manage.md#start-the-migration) in the converged policy. Now, you can migrate in just a few selections by using the migration guide. The guide evaluates what your organization currently has enabled in both legacy policies, and generates a recommended converged policy configuration for you to review and edit as needed. From there, confirm the configuration, and we set it up for you and mark your migration as complete. For more information, see: [How to migrate MFA and SSPR policy settings to the Authentication methods policy for Microsoft Entra ID](../identity/authentication/how-to-authentication-methods-manage.md).

### Public Preview - External Auth Methods support for system preferred MFA

**Type:** New feature    
**Service category:** MFA    
**Product capability:** 3rd Party Integration    

Support for external auth methods as a supported method begins rolling out at the beginning of March 2025. When this is live in a tenant where system preferred is enabled and users are in scope of an external auth methods policy, those users will be prompted for their external authentication method if their most secure registered method is Microsoft Authenticator notification. External Authentication Method will appear as third in the list of most secure methods. If the user has a Temporary Access Pass (TAP) or Passkey (FIDO2) device registered, they'll be prompted for those. In addition, users in the scope of an external auth methods policy will have the ability to delete all registered second factor methods from their account, even if the method being deleted is specified as the default sign in method or is system preferred. For more information, see: [System-preferred multifactor authentication - Authentication methods policy](../identity/authentication/concept-system-preferred-multifactor-authentication.md).

### General Availability - Improving visibility into downstream tenant sign-ins

**Type:** New feature    
**Service category:** Reporting    
**Product capability:** Monitoring & Reporting    

Microsoft Security wants to ensure that all customers are aware of how to notice when a partner is accessing a downstream tenant's resources. Interactive sign-in logs currently provide a list of sign in events, but there's no clear indication of which logins are from partners accessing downstream tenant resources. For example, when reviewing the logs, you might see a series of events, but without any additional context, it’s difficult to tell whether these logins are from a partner accessing another tenant’s data.

Here's a list of steps that one can take to clarify which logins are associated with partner tenants:

1. Take note of the  "ServiceProvider" value in the CrossTenantAccessType column:
    - This filter can be applied to refine the log data. When activated, it immediately isolates events related to partner logins.
2. Utilize the "Home Tenant ID" and "Resource Tenant ID" Columns:
    - These two columns identify logins coming from the partner’s tenant to a downstream tenant.


After seeing a partner logging into a downstream tenant’s resources, an important follow-up activity to perform is to validate the activities that might have occurred in the downstream environment. Some examples of logs to look at are Microsoft Entra Audit logs for Microsoft Entra ID events, Microsoft 365 Unified Audit Log (UAL) for Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Entra ID events, and/or the Azure Monitor activity log for Azure events. By following these steps, you're able to clearly identify when a partner is logging into a downstream tenant’s resources and subsequent activity in the environment, enhancing your ability to manage and monitor cross-tenant access efficiently.

To increase visibility into the aforementioned columns, Microsoft Entra will begin enabling these columns to display by default when loading the sign-in logs UX starting on March 7, 2025.

### Public Preview - Auditing administrator events in Microsoft Entra Connect

**Type:** New feature    
**Service category:** Microsoft Entra Connect    
**Product capability:** Microsoft Entra Connect

### General Availability - Real-time Password Spray Detection in Microsoft Entra ID Protection

**Type:** New feature    
**Service category:** Identity Protection    
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection    

Traditionally, password spray attacks are detected post breach or as part of hunting activity. Now, we’ve enhanced Microsoft Entra ID Protection to detect password spray attacks in real-time before the attacker ever obtains a token. This reduces remediation from hours to seconds by interrupting attacks during the sign-in flow.

Risk-based Conditional Access can automatically respond to this new signal by raising session risk, immediately challenging the sign-in attempt, and stopping password spray attempts in their tracks. This cutting-edge detection, now Generally Available, works alongside existing detections for advanced attacks such as Adversary-in-the-Middle (AitM) phishing and token theft, to ensure comprehensive coverage against modern attacks. For more information, see: [What is Microsoft Entra ID Protection?](../id-protection/overview-identity-protection.md)

### Deprecated - Action Required by February 1, 2025: Azure AD Graph retirement

**Type:** Deprecated    
**Service category:** Azure AD Graph    
**Product capability:** Developer Experience    

The Azure AD Graph API service was [deprecated] in 2020. [Retirement of the Azure AD Graph API service](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/june-2024-update-on-azure-ad-graph-api-retirement/ba-p/4094534) began in September 2024, and the next phase of this retirement starts February 1, 2025. This phase will impact new and existing applications unless action is taken. The latest updates on Azure AD Graph retirement can be found here: [Take action by February 1: Azure AD Graph is retiring](https://aka.ms/AzureADGraphRetirement).

Starting from February 1, both new and existing applications will be prevented from calling Azure AD Graph APIs, unless they're configured for an extension. You might not see impact right away, as we’re rolling out this change in stages across tenants. We anticipate full deployment of this change around the end of February, and by the end of March for national cloud deployments.

If you haven't already, it's now urgent to review the applications on your tenant to see which ones depend on Azure AD Graph API access, and mitigate or migrate these before the February 1 cutoff date. For applications that haven't migrated to Microsoft Graph APIs, [an extension](/graph/applications-authenticationbehaviors?tabs=http#allow-extended-azure-ad-graph-access-until-june-30-2025) can be set to allow the application access to Azure AD Graph through June 30, 2025.

Microsoft Entra Recommendations are the best tool to identify applications that are using Azure AD Graph APIs in your tenant and require action. Reference this blog post: Action required: [Azure AD Graph API retirement](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/identity/action-required-azure-ad-graph-api-retirement/4090533) for step by step guidance.

### Deprecated - Take action to avoid impact when legacy MSOnline and AzureAD PowerShell modules retire

**Type:** Deprecated    
**Service category:** Legacy MSOnline and AzureAD PowerShell modules    
**Product capability:** Developer Experience    

As announced in Microsoft Entra [change announcements](https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ChangeManagementHubList.ReactView) and in the Microsoft Entra [Blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/identity/important-update-deprecation-of-azure-ad-powershell-and-msonline-powershell-modu/4094536), the MSOnline, and Microsoft Azure AD PowerShell modules (for Microsoft Entra ID) retired on March 30, 2024.

The retirement for MSOnline PowerShell module starts in early April 2025, and ends in late May 2025. If you're using MSOnline PowerShell, you must take action by March 30, 2025 to avoid impact after the retirement by migrating any use of MSOnline to [Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK](/powershell/microsoftgraph/installation) or [Microsoft Entra PowerShell](/powershell/entra-powershell/installation).

Key points

- MSOnline PowerShell will retire, and stop working, between early April 2025 and late May 2025
- AzureAD PowerShell will no longer be supported after March 30, 2025, but its retirement will happen in early July 2025. This postponement is to allow you time to finish the MSOnline PowerShell migration
- To ensure customer readiness for MSOnline PowerShell retirement, a series of temporary outage tests will occur for all tenants between January 2025 and March 2025.

For more information, see: [Action required: MSOnline and AzureAD PowerShell retirement - 2025 info and resources](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/identity/action-required-msonline-and-azuread-powershell-retirement---2025-info-and-resou/4364991).

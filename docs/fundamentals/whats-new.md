### Public Preview - Convert external users to internal

**Type:** New feature    
**Service category:** User Management    
**Product capability:** User Management    

External user conversion enables customers to convert external users to internal members without needing to delete and create new user objects. Maintaining the same underlying object ensures the user’s account, and access to resources, isn’t disrupted and that their history of activities remains intact as their relationship with the host organization changes. 

The external to internal user conversion feature includes the ability to convert on-premises synchronized users as well. For more information, see: [Convert external users to internal users (Preview)](../identity/users/convert-external-users-internal.md).

### Public Preview - Alternate Email Notifications for Lockbox Requests

**Type:** New feature    
**Service category:** Other    
**Product capability:** Access Control    

Customer Lockbox for Microsoft Azure is launching a new feature that enables customers to use alternate email IDs for getting lockbox notifications.

- The familiar ‘*Locations*’ condition is unchanged, updating the policy in the ‘*Locations*’ condition are reflected in the ‘*Network*’ assignment, and vice versa.
- No functionality changes, existing policies will continue to work without changes.

Customer Lockbox for Microsoft Azure is launching a new built-in Azure Role-based access control role that enables customers to use a lesser privileged role for users responsible for approving/rejecting Customer Lockbox requests. This feature is targeted to the customer admin workflow where a lockbox approver acts on the request from Microsoft Support engineer to access Azure resources in a customer subscription.

In this first phase, we're launching a new built-in Azure RBAC role that helps scope down the access possible for an individual with Azure Customer Lockbox approver rights on a subscription and its resources. A similar role for tenant-scoped requests is available in subsequent releases.

## February 2024

### General Availability - Identity Protection and Risk Remediation on the Azure Mobile App

**Type:** New feature    
**Service category:** Identity Protection    
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection    

Previously supported only on the portal, Identity Protection is a powerful tool that empowers administrators to proactively manage identity risks. Now available on the Azure Mobile app, administrators can respond to potential threats with ease and efficiency. This feature includes comprehensive reporting, offering insights into risky behaviors such as compromised user accounts and suspicious sign-ins.

With the Risky users report, administrators gain visibility into accounts flagged as compromised or vulnerable. Actions such as blocking/unblocking sign-ins, confirming the legitimacy of compromises, or resetting passwords are conveniently accessible, ensuring timely risk mitigation.

Additionally, the Risky sign-ins report provides a detailed overview of suspicious sign-in activities, aiding administrators in identifying potential security breaches. While capabilities on mobile are limited to viewing sign-in details, administrators can take necessary actions through the portal, such as blocking sign-ins. Alternatively, admins can choose to manage the corresponding risky user's account until all risks are mitigated.

Stay ahead of identity risks effortlessly with Identity Protection on the Azure Mobile app. These capabilities are intended to provide user with the tools to maintain a secure environment and peace of mind for their organization.

The mobile app can be downloaded at the following links:

### Decommissioning of Group Writeback V2 (Public Preview) in Entra Connect Sync

**Type:** Plan for change   
**Service category:** Provisioning                     
**Product capability:**  Microsoft Entra Connect Sync             

The public preview of Group Writeback V2 (GWB) in Entra Connect Sync will no longer be available after June 30, 2024. After this date, Connect Sync will no longer support provisioning cloud security groups to Active Directory.

Another similar functionality is offered in Entra Cloud Sync, called “*Group Provision to AD*”, that maybe used instead of GWB V2 for provisioning cloud security groups to AD. Enhanced functionality in Cloud Sync, along with other new features, are being developed.

Customers who use this preview feature in Connect Sync should [switch their configuration from Connect Sync to Cloud Sync](../identity/hybrid/cloud-sync/migrate-group-writeback.md). Customers can choose to move all their hybrid sync to Cloud Sync (if it supports their needs) or Cloud Sync can be run side-by-side and move only cloud security group provisioning to AD onto Cloud Sync.

Customers who provision Microsoft 365 groups to AD can continue using GWB V1 for this capability.  

Customers can evaluate moving exclusively to Cloud Sync by using this wizard: https://aka.ms/EvaluateSyncOptions

With this capability, existing customers who have this feature enabled in Microsoft Entra Connect sync can now migrate, and apply, this feature with Microsoft Entra cloud sync. For more information, see: [Exchange hybrid writeback with cloud sync](../identity/hybrid/exchange-hybrid-writeback.md).

1. Multifactor authentication for admin portals: This policy covers privileged admin roles and requires multifactor authentication when an admin signs into a Microsoft admin portal.
1. Multifactor authentication for per-user multifactor authentication users: This policy covers users with per-user multifactor authentication and requires multifactor authentication for all cloud apps.
1. Multifactor authentication for high-risk sign-ins: This policy covers all users and requires multifactor authentication and reauthentication for high-risk sign-ins.

Custom security attributes in Microsoft Entra ID are business-specific attributes (key-value pairs) that you can define and assign to Microsoft Entra objects. These attributes can be used to store information, categorize objects, or enforce fine-grained access control over specific Azure resources. Custom security attributes can be used with [Azure attribute-based access control (Azure ABAC)](/azure/role-based-access-control/conditions-overview). For more information, see: [What are custom security attributes in Microsoft Entra ID?](./custom-security-attributes-overview.md).

Changes were made to custom security attribute audit logs for general availability that might impact your daily operations. If you have been using custom security attribute audit logs during the preview, there are the actions you must take before February 2024 to ensure your audit log operations aren't disrupted. For more information, see: [Custom security attribute audit logs](./custom-security-attributes-manage.md#custom-security-attribute-audit-logs).

# Configure Microsoft Entra for Zero Trust: Protect networks

The "Protect networks" pillar of the [Secure Future Initiative](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center/security/secure-future-initiative?msockid=2bad2df65a416adb0e5838355b3e6b95#SFI-pillars) emphasizes the critical importance of securing network access and implementing network-based controls to prevent unauthorized access to organizational resources. The best practices in this pillar focus on actions such as establishing network boundaries, controlling traffic flows, and implementing location-based access policies that verify the trustworthiness of network connections before granting access.

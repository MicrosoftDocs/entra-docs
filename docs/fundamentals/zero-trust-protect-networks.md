# Configure Microsoft Entra for Zero Trust: Protect networks

The "Protect networks" pillar of the [Secure Future Initiative](https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/content/microsoftcorp/microsoft/final/microsoft-brand/documents/sfi-protect-networks.pdf) emphasizes the critical importance of securing network access and implementing network-based controls to prevent unauthorized access to organizational resources. This security domain focuses on establishing network boundaries, controlling traffic flows, and implementing location-based access policies that verify the trustworthiness of network connections before granting access. By configuring named locations and tenant restriction policies, organizations can create a robust network security posture that limits access based on geographic locations, IP ranges, and network trust levels. These network protection measures help prevent data exfiltration, reduce the attack surface, and ensure that access to sensitive resources is granted only from trusted network locations, forming a foundational layer of the Zero Trust security model.

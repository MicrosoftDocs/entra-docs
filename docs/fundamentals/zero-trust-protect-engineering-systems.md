# Configure Microsoft Entra for Zero Trust: Protect engineering systems

The [Secure Future Initiative](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center/security/secure-future-initiative?msockid=2bad2df65a416adb0e5838355b3e6b95#SFI-pillars) pillar for protecting engineering systems was first developed to safeguard Microsoftâ€™s own software assets and infrastructure. The practices and insights gained from this internal work are now shared with customers, enabling you to strengthen your own environments.

These recommendations focus on ensuring least privilege access to your organization's engineering systems and resources.

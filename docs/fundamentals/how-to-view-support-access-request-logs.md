# View activity logs for Microsoft Support access requests (preview)

All activities related to Microsoft Support access requests are included in the Microsoft Entra audit logs. Activities can include requests from users in your tenant or an automated service. This article describes how to view the different types of activity logs.

## Prerequisites

To access the audit logs for a tenant, you must have one of the following roles: 

- Reports Reader
- Security Reader
- Security Administrator

## How to access the logs

You can access a filtered view of audit logs for your tenant from the Microsoft Support access requests area. Select **Audit logs** from the side menu to view the audit logs with the category automatically selected.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Service Support Administrator](../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#service-support-administrator).

1. Browse to **Learn & support** > **Diagnose and solve problems**.

1. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select **Manage pending requests** from the **Microsoft Support Access Requests** section.

You can also access these logs from the Microsoft Entra audit logs. Select **Core Directory** as the service and `MicrosoftSupportAccessManagement` as the category.

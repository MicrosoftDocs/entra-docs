# Bulk operations in Microsoft Entra ID (Preview)

The new bulk operations experience in Microsoft Entra ID provides enhanced capabilities for managing **Groups** and **Devices**. This service enables bulk actions including create, update, and delete operations. The improved service delivers better performance, reduces timeouts, and removes scaling limitations for large tenants.

> [!NOTE] 
> The new bulk operations service currently only supports **Groups**, **Devices**, and **Users** export. Support for additional entities like **Enterprise applications** will be added in a future update.

For information about limitations and to learn more about the previous Bulk Operations experience, see [Bulk operations service limitations](bulk-operations-service-limitations.md).

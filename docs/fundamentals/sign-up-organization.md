# Sign up for Microsoft Entra ID

Sign up for [Microsoft Entra ID](get-started-premium.md) or a [new Microsoft Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) using either:

- **Microsoft account.** Use your personal Microsoft account to access Azure and consumer-oriented Microsoft products like Outlook, OneDrive, and Xbox LIVE. Signing up for an Outlook.com mailbox automatically creates a Microsoft account. Learn more in the [Microsoft account overview](https://account.microsoft.com/account).  

- **Work or school account.** Use your work or school account to access enterprise cloud services like Azure, Microsoft Intune, and Microsoft 365. When you sign up for these services, Microsoft Entra ID automatically creates a cloud-based directory for your organization.

  > [!NOTE]
  > We recommend that you use your work or school account if you already have access to Microsoft Entra ID. However, you should use whichever type of account is associated with your Azure subscription.

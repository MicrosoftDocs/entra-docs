### Public Preview - Microsoft Entra new store for certificate-based authentication

**Type:** New feature    
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)    
**Product capability:** User Authentication    

Microsoft Entra ID has a new scalable **PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) based CA** (Certificate Authorities) store with higher limits for the number of CAs and the size of each CA file. PKI based CA store allows CAs within each different PKI to be in its own container object allowing administrators to move away from one flat list of CAs to more efficient PKI container based CAs. PKI-based CA store now supports up to 250CAs, 8KB size for each CA and also supports issuers hints attribute for each CA. Administrators can also upload the entire PKI and all the CAs using the "Upload CBA PKI" feature or create a PKI container and upload CAs individually. For more information, see: [Step 1: Configure the certificate authorities with PKI-based trust store (Preview)](../identity/authentication/how-to-certificate-based-authentication.md#step-1-configure-the-certificate-authorities-with-pki-based-trust-store-preview).

### General Availability - Microsoft Entra Health Monitoring, Health Metrics Feature

**Type:** New feature    
**Service category:** Reporting    
**Product capability:** Monitoring & Reporting    

Microsoft Entra health monitoring, available from the Health pane, includes a set of low-latency pre-computed health metrics that can be used to monitor the health of critical user scenarios in your tenant. The first set of health scenarios includes MFA, CA-compliant devices, CA-managed devices, and SAML authentications. This set of monitor scenarios will grow over time. These health metrics are now released as general availability data streams with the public preview of an intelligent alerting capability. For more information, see: [What is Microsoft Entra Health?](../identity/monitoring-health/concept-microsoft-entra-health.md).

### General Availability - Microsoft Entra Connect Sync Version 2.4.27.0

**Type:** Changed feature       
**Service category:** Provisioning        
**Product capability:** Identity Governance        

On November 14, 2025, we released Microsoft Entra Connect Sync Version 2.4.27.0 that uses the OLE DB version 18.7.4 that further hardens our service.

### Changed feature - expansion of WhatsApp as an MFA one-time passcode delivery channel for Microsoft Entra ID

**Type:** Changed feature    
**Service category:** MFA    
**Product capability:** User Authentication    

In late 2023, Microsoft Entra ID started using WhatsApp as an alternate channel to deliver multifactor authentication (MFA) one-time passcodes to users in India and Indonesia. We saw improved deliverability, completion rates, and satisfaction when using the channel in both countries. The channel was temporarily disabled in India in early 2024. Starting early December 2024, we'll be re-enabling the channel in India, and expanding its use to more countries.

Starting December 2024, users in India, and other countries can start receiving MFA text messages via WhatsApp. Only users that are enabled to receive MFA text messages as an authentication method, and already have WhatsApp on their phone, get this experience. If a user with WhatsApp on their device is unreachable or doesn’t have internet connectivity, we'll quickly fall back to the regular SMS channel. In addition, users receiving OTPs via WhatsApp for the first time will be notified of the change in behavior via SMS text message. 

If you don’t want your users to receive MFA text messages through WhatsApp, you can disable text messages as an authentication method in your organization or scope it down to only be enabled for a subset of users. Note that we highly encourage organizations move to using more modern, secure methods like Microsoft Authenticator and passkeys in favor of telecom and messaging app methods. For more information, see: [Text message verification](../identity/authentication/concept-authentication-phone-options.md#text-message-verification).

### Retirement - MFA Fraud Alert will be retired on March 1st 2025

**Type:** Deprecated    
**Service category:** MFA    
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection    

Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication (MFA) fraud alert allows end users to report MFA voice calls, and Microsoft Authenticator push requests, they didn't initiate as fraudulent. Beginning March 1, 2025, MFA Fraud Alert will be retired in favor of the replacement feature [Report Suspicious Activity](../identity/authentication/howto-mfa-mfasettings.md#report-suspicious-activity) which allows end users to report fraudulent requests, and is also integrated with [Identity Protection](../id-protection/overview-identity-protection.md) for more comprehensive coverage and remediation. To ensure users can continue reporting fraudulent MFA requests, organizations should migrate to using Report Suspicious Activity, and review how reported activity is remediated based on their Microsoft Entra licensing. For more information, see: [Configure Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication settings](../identity/authentication/howto-mfa-mfasettings.md).

### Public Preview - Microsoft Entra Health Monitoring, Alerts Feature

**Type:** Changed feature    
**Service category:** Other    
**Product capability:** Monitoring & Reporting    

Intelligent alerts in Microsoft Entra health monitoring notify tenant admins, and security engineers, whenever a monitored scenario breaks from its typical pattern. Microsoft Entra's alerting capability watches the low-latency health signals of each scenario, and fires a notification if an anomaly is detected. The set of alert-ready health signals and scenarios will grow over time. This alerts feature is now available in Microsoft Entra Health as an API-only public preview release (UX release is scheduled for February 2025). For more information, see: [How to use Microsoft Entra Health monitoring alerts (preview)](../identity/monitoring-health/howto-use-health-scenario-alerts.md).

### General Availability - Log analytics sign-in logs schema is in parity with MSGraph schema

**Type:** Plan for change    
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)    
**Product capability:** Monitoring & Reporting    

To maintain consistency in our core logging principles, we've addressed a legacy parity issue where the Azure Log Analytics sign-in logs schema didn't align with the MSGraph sign-in logs schema. The updates include fields such as ClientCredentialType, CreatedDateTime, ManagedServiceIdentity, NetworkLocationDetails, tokenProtectionStatus, SessionID, among others. These changes take effect in the first week of December 2024.

We believe this enhancement provides a more consistent logging experience. As always, you can perform pre-ingestion transformations to remove any unwanted data from your Azure Log Analytics storage workspaces. For guidance on how to perform these transformations, see: [Data collection transformations in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/data-collection-transformations).

---

### Deprecated - MIM hybrid reporting agent

**Type:** Deprecated    
**Service category:** Microsoft Identity Manager    
**Product capability:** Monitoring & Reporting    

The hybrid reporting agent, used to send a MIM Service event log to Microsoft Entra to surface in password reset and self-service group management reports, is deprecated. The recommended replacement is to use Azure Arc to send the event logs to Azure Monitor. For more information, see: [Microsoft Identity Manager 2016 reporting with Azure Monitor](/microsoft-identity-manager/mim-azure-monitor-reporting).

## October 2024

### Public Preview - Passkey authentication in brokered Microsoft apps on Android

**Type:** New feature    
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)    
**Product capability:** User Authentication    

Microsoft Entra ID users can now use a passkey to sign into Microsoft apps on Android devices where an authentication broker like Microsoft Authenticator, or Microsoft Intune Company Portal, is installed. For more information, see: [Support for FIDO2 authentication with Microsoft Entra ID](../identity/authentication/concept-fido2-compatibility.md).

---

### Public Preview Refresh - Passkeys in Microsoft Authenticator

**Type:** New feature    
**Service category:** Microsoft Authenticator App    
**Product capability:** User Authentication    

Public preview of passkeys in the Microsoft Authenticator will now support additional features. Admins can now require attestation during registration of a passkey, and Android native apps now supports signing in with passkeys in the Authenticator. Additionally, users are now prompted to sign in to the Authenticator app to register a passkey when initiating the flow from MySignIns. The Authenticator app passkey registration wizard walks the user through meeting all the prerequisites within the context of the app before attempting registration. Download the latest version of the Authenticator app and give us feedback as you pilot these changes in your organization. For more information, see: [Enable passkeys in Microsoft Authenticator (preview)](../identity/authentication/how-to-enable-authenticator-passkey.md).

---

### Public Preview - Authentication methods migration wizard

**Type:** New feature    
**Service category:** MFA    
**Product capability:** User Authentication    

The authentication methods migration guide (preview) in the Microsoft Entra admin center lets you automatically migrate method management from the [legacy MFA and SSPR policies](../identity/authentication/concept-authentication-methods-manage.md#legacy-mfa-and-sspr-policies) to the [converged authentication methods policy](../identity/authentication/concept-authentication-methods-manage.md). In 2023, it was announced that the ability to manage authentication methods in the legacy MFA and SSPR policies would be retired in September 2025. Until now, organizations had to manually migrate methods themselves by leveraging [the migration toggle](../identity/authentication/how-to-authentication-methods-manage.md#start-the-migration) in the converged policy. Now, you can migrate in just a few selections by using the migration guide. The guide evaluates what your organization currently has enabled in both legacy policies, and generates a recommended converged policy configuration for you to review and edit as needed. From there, confirm the configuration and we set it up for you and mark your migration as complete. For more information, see: [How to migrate MFA and SSPR policy settings to the Authentication methods policy for Microsoft Entra ID](../identity/authentication/how-to-authentication-methods-manage.md).

## September 2024

### Public preview - New Conditional Access Template Requiring Device Compliance 

**Type:** New feature    
**Service category:** Conditional Access    
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection    

A new Conditional Access template requiring device compliance is now available in Public Preview. This template restricts access to company resources exclusively to devices enrolled in mobile device management (MDM) and compliant with company policy. Requiring device compliance improves data security, reducing risk of data breaches, malware infections, and unauthorized access. This is a recommended best practice for users and devices targeted by compliance policy through MDM. For more information, see: [Common policy: Create a Conditional Access policy requiring device compliance.](../identity/conditional-access/policy-all-users-device-compliance.md)

### Public preview - Tenant admin can fail certificate based auth when the end user certificate issuer isn't configured with a certificate revocation list

**Type:** New feature    
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)    
**Product capability:** User Authentication    

With Certificate based authentication, a CA can be uploaded without a CRL endpoint, and certificate-based authentication won't fail if an issuing CA doesn't have a CRL specified.

To strengthen security and avoid misconfigurations, an Authentication Policy Administrator can require CBA authentication to fail if no CRL is configured for a CA that issues an end user certificate. For more information, see: [Understanding CRL validation (Preview)](../identity/authentication/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive.md#understanding-crl-validation).

---

### General Availability: Microsoft Authenticator on Android is FIPS 140 compliant for Microsoft Entra authentication

**Service category:** Microsoft Authenticator App    
**Product capability:** User Authentication    

Beginning with version 6.2408.5807, Microsoft Authenticator for Android is compliant with Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS 140-3) for all Microsoft Entra authentications, including phishing-resistant device-bound passkeys, push multifactor authentication (MFA), passwordless phone sign-in (PSI), and time-based one-time passcodes (TOTP). No changes in configuration are required in Microsoft Authenticator or Microsoft Entra ID Admin Portal to enable this capability. Microsoft Authenticator on iOS is already FIPS 140 compliant, as announced last year. For more information, see: [Authentication methods in Microsoft Entra ID - Microsoft Authenticator app](../identity/authentication/concept-authentication-authenticator-app.md).

### Public Preview - Custom Claims API for Claims Configuration of Enterprise Apps

**Type:** New feature    
**Service category:** Enterprise Apps    
**Product capability:** SSO    

Custom Claims API allows admins to manage and update additional claims for their Enterprise Applications seamlessly through MS Graph. The Custom Claims API offers a simplified and user friendly API experience for claims management for our customers. With the introduction of Custom Claims API, we achieved UX and API interoperability. Admins can now use Microsoft Entra admin center and MS Graph API interchangeably to manage claims configurations for their Enterprise Applications. It facilitates admins to execute their automations using the API while allowing the flexibility to update claims on the Microsoft Entra admin center as required on the same policy object. For more information, see: [Customize claims using Microsoft Graph Custom Claims Policy (preview)](../identity-platform/claims-customization-custom-claims-policy.md).

---

### General Availability - Cross-tenant manager synchronization

**Type:** New feature    
**Service category:** Provisioning    
**Product capability:** Identity Governance    

Support for synchronizing the manager attribute using cross-tenant synchronization is now generally available. For more information, see: [Attributes](../identity/multi-tenant-organizations/cross-tenant-synchronization-overview.md#attributes).

---

### Public Preview - Request on behalf of

**Type:** New feature    
**Service category:** Entitlement Management    
**Product capability:** Entitlement Management    

Entitlement Management enables admins to create access packages to manage their organization’s resources. Admins can either directly assign users to an access package, or configure an access package policy that allows users and group members to request access. This option to create self-service processes is useful, especially as organizations scale and hire more employees. However, new employees joining an organization might not always know what they need access to, or how they can request access. In this case, a new employee would likely rely on their manager to guide them through the access request process.

Instead of having new employees navigate the request process, managers can request access packages for their employees, making onboarding faster and more seamless. To enable this functionality for managers, admins can select an option when setting up an access package policy that allows managers to request access on their employees' behalf.

Expanding self-service request flows to allow requests on behalf of employees ensures that users have timely access to necessary resources, and increases productivity. For more information, see: [Request access package on-behalf-of other users (Preview)](../id-governance/entitlement-management-request-behalf.md).

## August 2024

### Change announcement - Upcoming MFA Enforcement on Microsoft Entra admin center

**Type:** Plan for change     
**Service category:** MFA   
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection    

As part of our commitment to providing our customers with the highest level of security, we previously [announced](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/core-infrastructure-and-security/update-on-mfa-requirements-for-azure-sign-in/ba-p/4177584) that Microsoft requires multifactor authentication (MFA) for users signing into Azure.

We'd like to share an update that the scope of MFA enforcement includes [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/) in addition to the Azure portal and Intune admin center. This change is rolled out in phases, allowing organizations time to plan their implementation:

**Phase 1**: Beginning in the second half of the calendar year 2024, MFA is required to sign in to the Microsoft Entra admin center, Azure portal, and Intune admin center. This enforcement is gradually rolled out to all tenants worldwide. This phase didn't affect other Azure clients such as the Azure Command Line Interface, Azure PowerShell, Azure mobile app, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools.

**Phase 2**: Beginning in early 2025, gradual enforcement of MFA at sign-in for the Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, Azure mobile app, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools commences.

Microsoft sends a 60-day advance notice to all Microsoft Entra Global Administrators by email, and through Azure Service Health Notifications, to notify them of the start date of enforcement and required actions. Extra notifications are sent through the Azure portal, Microsoft Entra admin center, and the Microsoft 365 message center.

We understand that some customers might need extra time to prepare for this MFA requirement. Therefore, Microsoft allows extended time for customers with complex environments or technical barriers. The notification from us also includes details about how customers can postpone specific changes. These changes include the start date of enforcement for their tenants, the duration of the postponement, and a link to apply changes. Visit [here](../identity/authentication/concept-mandatory-multifactor-authentication.md) to learn more.

### General Availability - restricted permissions on Directory Synchronization Accounts (DSA) role in Microsoft Entra Connect Sync and Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync

**Type:** Changed feature     
**Service category:** Provisioning   
**Product capability:** Microsoft Entra Connects    

As part of ongoing security hardening, Microsoft removes unused permissions from the privileged *Directory Synchronization Accounts* role. This role is exclusively used by Microsoft Entra Connect Sync, and Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync, to synchronize Active Directory objects with Microsoft Entra ID. There's no action required by customers to benefit from this hardening, and the revised role permissions are documented here: [Directory Synchronization Accounts](../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#directory-synchronization-accounts).

---

### Plan for change - My Security-Info Add sign-in method picker UX update

**Type:** Plan for change     
**Service category:** MFA   
**Product capability:** End User Experiences    

Starting Mid-October 2024, the *Add sign-in* method dialog on the My Security-Info page will be updated with a modern look and feel. With this change, new descriptors will be added under each method which provides detail to users on how the sign-in method is used (ex. *Microsoft Authenticator – Approve sign-in requests* or *use one-time codes*).  

Early next year the *Add sign-in* method, dialog will be enhanced to show an initially recommended sign-in method instead of initially showing the full list of sign-in methods available to register. The recommended sign-in method will default to the strongest method available to the user based on the organization’s authentication method policy. Users can select *Show more options* and choose from all available sign-in methods allowed by their policy.

This change will occur automatically, so admins take no action.

---

### Public Preview - Provisioning UX Updates

**Type:** Plan for change    
**Service category:** Provisioning    
**Product capability:** Outbound to SaaS Applications    

We'll start releasing user experience updates for application provisioning, HR provisioning, and cross-tenant synchronization next month.

### General Availability - Identity Protection and Risk Remediation on the Azure Mobile App

**Type:** New feature    
**Service category:** Identity Protection    
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection    

Identity Protection, previously supported only on the portal, is a powerful tool that empowers administrators to proactively manage identity risks. Now available on the Azure Mobile app, administrators can respond to potential threats with ease and efficiency. This feature includes comprehensive reporting, offering insights into risky behaviors such as compromised user accounts and suspicious sign-ins.

With the Risky users report, administrators gain visibility into accounts flagged as compromised or vulnerable. Actions such as blocking/unblocking sign-ins, confirming the legitimacy of compromises, or resetting passwords are conveniently accessible, ensuring timely risk mitigation.

Additionally, the Risky sign-ins report provides a detailed overview of suspicious sign-in activities, aiding administrators in identifying potential security breaches. While capabilities on mobile are limited to viewing sign-in details, administrators can take necessary actions through the portal, such as blocking sign-ins. Alternatively, admins can choose to manage the corresponding risky user's account until all risks are mitigated.

Stay ahead of identity risks effortlessly with Identity Protection on the Azure Mobile app. These capabilities are intended to provide user with the tools to maintain a secure environment and peace of mind for their organization.

The mobile app can be downloaded at the following links:

### General Availability - Restrict Microsoft Entra ID Tenant Creation To Only Paid Subscription  

**Type:** Changed feature   
**Service category:** Managed identities for Azure resources                    
**Product capability:** End User Experiences            

The ability to create new tenants from the Microsoft Entra admin center allows users in your organization to create test and demo tenants from your Microsoft Entra ID tenant, [Learn more about creating tenants](/microsoft-365/education/deploy/intro-azure-active-directory). When used incorrectly this feature can allow the creation of tenants that aren't managed or viewable by your organization. We recommend that you restrict this capability so that only trusted admins can use this feature, [Learn more about restricting member users' default permissions](users-default-permissions.md#restrict-member-users-default-permissions). We also recommend you use the Microsoft Entra audit log to monitor for the Directory Management: Create Company event that signals a new tenant created by a user in your organization.  

To further protect your organization, Microsoft is now limiting this functionality to only paid customers. Customers on trial subscriptions are unable to create more tenants from the Microsoft Entra admin center. Customers in this situation who need a new trial tenant can sign up for a [Free Azure Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

### General Availability - Users can't modify GPS location when using location based access control

**Type:** Plan for change   
**Service category:** Conditional Access                     
**Product capability:** User Authentication            

In an ever-evolving security landscape, the Microsoft Authenticator is updating its security baseline for Location Based Access Control (LBAC) Conditional Access policies. Microsoft does this to disallow authentications where the user might be using a different location than the actual GPS location of the mobile device. Today, it's possible for users to modify the location reported by the device on iOS and Android devices. The Authenticator app starts to deny LBAC authentications where we detect that the user isn't using the actual location of the mobile device where the Authenticator is installed.

In the November 2023 release of the Authenticator app, users who are modifying the location of their device sees a denial message in the app when doing an LBAC authentication. Microsoft ensures that users aren’t using older app versions to continue authenticating with a modified location. Beginning January 2024, any users that are on Android Authenticator 6.2309.6329 version or prior and iOS Authenticator version 6.7.16 or prior are blocked from using LBAC. To determine which users are using older versions of the Authenticator app, you can use [our MSGraph APIs](/graph/api/resources/microsoftauthenticatorauthenticationmethod).

### General Availability - Web Sign-In for Windows

**Type:** Changed feature              
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)                                 
**Product capability:** User Authentication    

We're thrilled to announce that as part of the Windows 11 September moment, we're releasing a new Web Sign-In experience that will expand the number of supported scenarios and greatly improve security, reliability, performance, and overall end-to-end experience for our users.

Web Sign-In (WSI) is a credential provider on the Windows lock/sign-in screen for AADJ joined devices that provide a web experience used for authentication and returns an auth token back to the operating system to allow the user to unlock/sign-in to the machine.

Web Sign-In was initially intended to be used for a wide range of auth credential scenarios; however, it was only previously released for limited scenarios such as: [Simplified EDU Web Sign-In](/education/windows/federated-sign-in?tabs=intune) and recovery flows via [Temporary Access Password (TAP)](~/identity/authentication/howto-authentication-temporary-access-pass.md).

The underlying provider for Web Sign-In is rewritten from the ground up with security and improved performance in mind. This release moves the Web Sign-in infrastructure from the Cloud Host Experience (CHX) WebApp to a newly written sign in Web Host (LWH) for the September moment. This release provides better security and reliability to support previous EDU & TAP experiences and new workflows enabling using various Auth Methods to unlock/sig in to the desktop.

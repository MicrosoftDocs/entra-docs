## December 2023

### Public Preview - Configurable redemption order for B2B collaboration

**Type:** New feature   
**Service category:** B2B                     
**Product capability:**  B2B/B2C

## November 2023

### Decommissioning of Group Writeback V2 (Public Preview) in Entra Connect Sync

**Type:** Plan for change   
**Service category:** Provisioning                     
**Product capability:**  Microsoft Entra Connect Sync             

The public preview of Group Writeback V2 (GWB) in Entra Connect Sync will no longer be available after June 30, 2024. After this date, Connect Sync will no longer support provisioning cloud security groups to Active Directory.

Another similar functionality is offered in Entra Cloud Sync, called “*Group Provision to AD*”, that maybe used instead of GWB V2 for provisioning cloud security groups to AD. Enhanced functionality in Cloud Sync, along with other new features, are being developed.

Customers who use this preview feature in Connect Sync should [switch their configuration from Connect Sync to Cloud Sync](../identity/hybrid/cloud-sync/migrate-group-writeback.md). Customers can choose to move all their hybrid sync to Cloud Sync (if it supports their needs) or Cloud Sync can be run side-by-side and move only cloud security group provisioning to AD onto Cloud Sync.

Customers who provision Microsoft 365 groups to AD can continue using GWB V1 for this capability.  

Customers can evaluate moving exclusively to Cloud Sync by using this wizard: https://aka.ms/EvaluateSyncOptions

**Type:** New feature   
**Service category:** Conditional Access                     
**Product capability:**  Access Control             

Starting in November 2023, Microsoft begins automatically protecting customers with Microsoft managed Conditional Access policies. These are policies that Microsoft creates and enables in external tenants. The following policies are rolled out to all eligible tenants, who are notified before policy creation:

1. Multifactor authentication for admin portals: This policy covers privileged admin roles and requires multifactor authentication when an admin signs into a Microsoft admin portal.
1. Multifactor authentication for per-user multifactor authentication users: This policy covers users with per-user multifactor authentication and requires multifactor authentication for all cloud apps.
1. Multifactor authentication for high-risk sign-ins: This policy covers all users and requires multifactor authentication and reauthentication for high-risk sign-ins.

### General Availability - Restrict Microsoft Entra ID Tenant Creation To Only Paid Subscription  

**Type:** Changed feature   
**Service category:** Managed identities for Azure resources                    
**Product capability:** End User Experiences            

The ability to create new tenants from the Microsoft Entra admin center allows users in your organization to create test and demo tenants from your Microsoft Entra ID tenant, [Learn more about creating tenants](/microsoft-365/education/deploy/intro-azure-active-directory). When used incorrectly this feature can allow the creation of tenants that aren't managed or viewable by your organization. We recommend that you restrict this capability so that only trusted admins can use this feature, [Learn more about restricting member users' default permissions](users-default-permissions.md#restrict-member-users-default-permissions). We also recommend you use the Microsoft Entra audit log to monitor for the Directory Management: Create Company event that signals a new tenant has been created by a user in your organization.  

To further protect your organization, Microsoft is now limiting this functionality to only paid customers. Customers on trial subscriptions are unable to create additional tenants from the Microsoft Entra admin center. Customers in this situation who need a new trial tenant can sign up for a [Free Azure Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

### General Availability - Users can't modify GPS location when using location based access control

**Type:** Plan for change   
**Service category:** Conditional Access                     
**Product capability:** User Authentication            

In an ever-evolving security landscape, the Microsoft Authenticator is updating its security baseline for Location Based Access Control (LBAC) conditional access policies to disallow authentications where the user might be using a different location than the actual GPS location of the mobile device. Today, it's possible for users to modify the location reported by the device on iOS and Android devices. The Authenticator app starts to deny LBAC authentications where we detect that the user isn't using the actual location of the mobile device where the Authenticator is installed.

In the November 2023 release of the Authenticator app, users who are modifying the location of their device sees a denial message in the app when doing an LBAC authentication. To ensure that users aren’t using older app versions to continue authenticating with a modified location, beginning January 2024, any users that are on Android Authenticator 6.2309.6329 version or prior and iOS Authenticator version 6.7.16 or prior will be blocked from using LBAC. To determine which users are using older versions of the Authenticator app, you can use [our MSGraph APIs](/graph/api/resources/microsoftauthenticatorauthenticationmethod).

**Service category:**  Authentications (Logins)                                
**Product capability:**  User Authentication                        

Beginning **January 2024**, Microsoft Entra ID supports [device-bound passkeys](https://passkeys.dev/docs/reference/terms/#device-bound-passkey) stored on computers and mobile devices as an authentication method in public preview, in addition to the existing support for FIDO2 security keys. This enables your users to perform phishing-resistant authentication using the devices that they already have.  

We expand the existing FIDO2 authentication methods policy, and end user experiences, to support this preview release. For your organization to opt in to this preview, you need to enforce key restrictions to allow specified passkey providers in your FIDO2 policy. Learn more about FIDO2 key restrictions [here](~/identity/authentication/howto-authentication-passwordless-security-key.md).

In addition, the existing end user sign-in option for Windows Hello and FIDO2 security keys are now indicated by “Face, fingerprint, PIN, or security key”. The term “passkey” will be mentioned in the updated sign-in experience to be inclusive of passkey credentials presented from security keys, mobile devices, and platform authenticators like Windows Hello.

We're thrilled to announce that as part of the Windows 11 September moment, we're releasing a new Web Sign-In experience that will expand the number of supported scenarios and greatly improve security, reliability, performance, and overall end-to-end experience for our users.

Web Sign-In (WSI) is a credential provider on the Windows lock/sign-in screen for AADJ joined devices that provide a web experience used for authentication and returns an auth token back to the operating system to allow the user to unlock/sign-in to the machine.

Web Sign-In was initially intended to be used for a wide range of auth credential scenarios; however, it was only previously released for limited scenarios such as: [Simplified EDU Web Sign-In](/education/windows/federated-sign-in?tabs=intune) and recovery flows via [Temporary Access Password (TAP)](~/identity/authentication/howto-authentication-temporary-access-pass.md).

The underlying provider for Web Sign-In is re-written from the ground up with security and improved performance in mind. This release moves the Web Sign-in infrastructure from the Cloud Host Experience (CHX) WebApp to a newly written Login Web Host (LWH) for the September moment. This release provides better security and reliability to support previous EDU & TAP experiences and new workflows enabling using various Auth Methods to unlock/login to the desktop.

### Public Preview(Refresh) - Custom Extensions in Entitlement Management

**Type:** New feature   
**Service category:** Entitlement management                          
**Product capability:** Identity Governance                

Last year we announced the [public preview of custom extensions in Entitlement Management](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/run-custom-workflows-in-azure-ad-entitlement-management/ba-p/2466938) allowing you to automate complex processes when access is requested or about to expire. We have recently expanded the public preview to allow for the access package assignment request to be paused while your external process is running. In addition, the external process can now provide feedback to Entitlement Management to either surface additional information to end users in MyAccess or even stop the access request. This expands the scenarios of custom extension from notifications to additional stakeholders or the generation of tickets to advanced scenarios such as external governance, risk and compliance checks. In the course of this update, we have also improved the audit logs, token security and the payload sent to the Logic App. To learn more about the preview refresh, see:

-  [Trigger Logic Apps with custom extensions in entitlement management (Preview)](~/id-governance/entitlement-management-logic-apps-integration.md)
- [accessPackageAssignmentRequest: resume](/graph/api/accesspackageassignmentrequest-resume)

### General Availability - Managed Identity in Microsoft Authentication Library for .NET

**Type:** New feature   
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)                            
**Product capability:** User Authentication               

The latest version of MSAL.NET graduates the Managed Identity APIs into the General Availability mode of support, which means that developers can integrate them safely in production workloads.

Managed identities are a part of the Azure infrastructure, simplifying how developers handle credentials and secrets to access cloud resources. With Managed Identities, developers don't need to manually handle credential retrieval and security. Instead, they can rely on an automatically managed set of identities to connect to resources that support Azure Active Directory authentication. You can learn more in [What are managed identities for Azure resources?](~/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md)

With MSAL.NET 4.54.0, the Managed Identity APIs are now stable. There are a few changes that we added that make them easier to use and integrate that might require tweaking your code if you’ve used our [experimental implementation](https://den.dev/blog/managed-identity-msal-net/):

- When using Managed Identity APIs, developers need to specify the identity type when creating an [ManagedIdentityApplication](/dotnet/api/microsoft.identity.client.managedidentityapplication).
- When acquiring tokens with Managed Identity APIs and using the default HTTP client, MSAL retries the request for certain exception codes.
- We added a new [MsalManagedIdentityException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.identity.client.msalmanagedidentityexception) class that represents any Managed Identity-related exceptions. It includes general exception information, including the Azure source from which the exception originates.
- MSAL will now proactively refresh tokens acquired with Managed Identity.

To get started with Managed Identity in MSAL.NET, you can use the [Microsoft.Identity.Client](/dotnet/api/microsoft.identity.client) package together with the [ManagedIdentityApplicationBuilder](/dotnet/api/microsoft.identity.client.managedidentityapplicationbuilder) class.

### General Availability - My Security-info now shows Microsoft Authenticator type

**Type:** Changed feature   
**Service category:** MFA                        
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection               

We've improved My Sign-ins and My Security-Info to give you more clarity on the types of Microsoft Authenticator or other Authenticator apps a user registers. Users will now see Microsoft Authenticator registrations with additional information showing the app as being registered as Push-based MFA or Password-less phone sign-in (PSI). For other Authenticator apps (Software OATH) we now indicate they're registered as a Time-based One-time password method. For more information, see: [Set up the Microsoft Authenticator app as your verification method](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/set-up-the-microsoft-authenticator-app-as-your-verification-method-33452159-6af9-438f-8f82-63ce94cf3d29).

## April 2023

### Public Preview - Custom attributes for Azure Active Directory Domain Services

**Type:** New feature   
**Service category:** Azure Active Directory Domain Services                     
**Product capability:** Azure Active Directory Domain Services            

Azure Active Directory Domain Services will now support synchronizing custom attributes from Azure AD for on-premises accounts. For more information, see: [Custom attributes for Azure Active Directory Domain Services](/entra/identity/domain-services/concepts-custom-attributes).

### General Availability - Enablement of combined security information registration for MFA and  self-service password reset (SSPR)

**Type:** New feature   
**Service category:** MFA                     
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection            

Last year, we announced the combined registration user experience for MFA and  self-service password reset (SSPR) was rolling out as the default experience for all organizations. We're happy to announce that the combined security information registration experience is now fully rolled out. This change doesn't affect tenants located in the China region. For more information, see: [Combined security information registration for Azure Active Directory overview](~/identity/authentication/concept-registration-mfa-sspr-combined.md).

### General Availability - System preferred MFA method

**Type:** Changed feature   
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)                       
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection            

Currently, organizations and users rely on a range of authentication methods, each offering varying degrees of security. While Multifactor Authentication (MFA) is crucial, some MFA methods are more secure than others. Despite having access to more secure MFA options, users frequently choose less secure methods for various reasons.

To address this challenge, we're introducing a new system-preferred authentication method for MFA. When users sign in, the system determines, and displays, the most secure MFA method that the user registered. This prompts users to switch from the default method to the most secure option. While users can still choose a different MFA method, they'll always be prompted to use the most secure method first for every session that requires MFA. For more information, see: [System-preferred multifactor authentication - Authentication methods policy](~/identity/authentication/concept-system-preferred-multifactor-authentication.md).

### Public Preview - Enhanced Create User and Invite User Experiences

**Type:** Changed feature   
**Service category:** User Management                     
**Product capability:** User Management            

We have increased the number of properties that admins are able to define when creating and inviting a user in the Entra admin portal. This brings our UX to parity with our Create User APIs. Additionally, admins can now add users to a group or administrative unit, and assign roles. For more information, see:  [How to create, invite, and delete users](~/fundamentals/how-to-create-delete-users.yml).

### Public Preview - Azure Active Directory Conditional Access protected actions

**Type:** Changed feature   
**Service category:** RBAC                    
**Product capability:** Access Control            

The protected actions public preview introduces the ability to apply Conditional Access to select permissions. When a user performs a protected action, they must satisfy Conditional Access policy requirements. For more information, see: [What are protected actions in Azure AD? (preview)](~/identity/role-based-access-control/protected-actions-overview.md).

---

### Public Preview - Token Protection for Sign-in Sessions

**Type:** New feature   
**Service category:** Conditional Access                  
**Product capability:** User Authentication          

Token Protection for sign-in sessions is our first release on a road-map to combat attacks involving token theft and replay. It provides Conditional Access enforcement of token proof-of-possession for supported clients and services that ensure that access to specified resources is only from a device to which the user has signed in. For more information, see: [Conditional Access: Token protection (preview)](~/identity/conditional-access/concept-token-protection.md).

### General Availability- New limits on number and size of group secrets starting June 2023

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Group Management                   
**Product capability:** Directory            

Starting in June 2023, the secrets stored on a single group can't exceed 48 individual secrets, or have a total size greater than 10 KB across all secrets on a single group. Groups with more than 10 KB of secrets will immediately stop working in June 2023. In June, groups exceeding 48 secrets are unable to increase the number of secrets they have, though they could still update or delete those secrets. We highly recommend reducing to fewer than 48 secrets by January 2024.

Group secrets are typically created when a group is assigned credentials to an app using Password-based single sign-on. To reduce the number of secrets assigned to a group, we recommend creating additional groups, and splitting up group assignments to your Password-based SSO applications across those new groups. For more information, see: [Add password-based single sign-on to an application](~/identity/enterprise-apps/configure-password-single-sign-on-non-gallery-applications.md).

### Public Preview - Authenticator Lite in Outlook

**Type:** New feature   
**Service category:** Microsoft Authenticator App                     
**Product capability:** User Authentication           

Authenticator Lite is an additional surface for Azure Active Directory users to complete multifactor authentication using push notifications on their Android or iOS device. With Authenticator Lite, users can satisfy a multifactor authentication requirement from the convenience of a familiar app. Authenticator Lite is currently enabled in the Outlook mobile app. Users could receive a notification in their Outlook mobile app to approve or deny, or use the Outlook app to generate an OATH verification code that can be entered during sign-in. The *'Microsoft managed'* setting for this feature will be set to be enabled on May 26, 2023. This enables the feature for all users in tenants where the feature is set to Microsoft managed. If you wish to change the state of this feature do so before May 26, 2023. For more information, see: [How to enable Microsoft Authenticator Lite for Outlook mobile (preview)](~/identity/authentication/how-to-mfa-authenticator-lite.md).

### General Availability - Number Matching for Microsoft Authenticator notifications

**Type:** Plan for Change  
**Service category:** Microsoft Authenticator App                      
**Product capability:** User Authentication             

Microsoft Authenticator app’s number matching feature has been Generally Available since Nov 2022! If you haven't already used the rollout controls (via Azure portal Admin UX and MSGraph APIs) to smoothly deploy number matching for users of Microsoft Authenticator push notifications, we highly encourage you to do so. We previously announced that we'll remove the admin controls and enforce the number match experience tenant-wide for all users of Microsoft Authenticator push notifications starting February 27, 2023. After listening to customers, we'll extend the availability of the rollout controls for a few more weeks. Organizations can continue to use the existing rollout controls until May 8, 2023, to deploy number matching in their organizations. Microsoft services will start enforcing the number matching experience for all users of Microsoft Authenticator push notifications after May 8, 2023. We'll also remove the rollout controls for number matching after that date.

If customers don’t enable number match for all Microsoft Authenticator push notifications prior to May 8, 2023, Authenticator users could experience inconsistent sign-ins while the services are rolling out this change. To ensure consistent behavior for all users, we highly recommend you enable number match for Microsoft Authenticator push notifications in advance.

For more information, see: [How to use number matching in multifactor authentication (MFA) notifications - Authentication methods policy](~/identity/authentication/how-to-mfa-number-match.md)

### Public Preview - IPv6 coming to Azure AD

**Type:** Plan for Change     
**Service category:** Identity Protection                     
**Product capability:** Platform             

Earlier, we announced our plan to bring IPv6 support to Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), enabling our customers to reach the Azure AD services over IPv4, IPv6 or dual stack endpoints. This is just a reminder that we have started introducing IPv6 support into Azure AD services in a phased approach in late March 2023.  
 
If you utilize Conditional Access or Identity Protection, and have IPv6 enabled on any of your devices, you likely must take action to avoid impacting your users. For most customers, IPv4 won't completely disappear from their digital landscape, so we aren't planning to require IPv6 or to deprioritize IPv4 in any Azure AD features or services. We continue to share additional guidance on IPv6 enablement in Azure AD at this link: [IPv6 support in Azure Active Directory](/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/azure-ad-ipv6-support).

### Modernizing Terms of Use Experiences

**Type:** Plan for Change  
**Service category:** Terms of use                  
**Product capability:** AuthZ/Access Delegation        

Starting July 2023, we're modernizing the following Terms of Use end user experiences with an updated PDF viewer, and moving the experiences from https://account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com to https://myaccount.microsoft.com:
- View previously accepted terms of use.
- Accept or decline terms of use as part of the sign-in flow.

No functionalities are removed. The new PDF viewer adds functionality and the limited visual changes in the end-user experiences will be communicated in a future update. If your organization has allow-listed only certain domains, you must ensure your allowlist includes the domains ‘myaccount.microsoft.com’ and ‘*.myaccount.microsoft.com’ for Terms of Use to continue working as expected.

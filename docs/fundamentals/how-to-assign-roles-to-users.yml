title: |
  Assign user roles with Microsoft Entra ID
introduction: |
  The ability to manage resources is granted by assigning roles that provide the required permissions. Roles can be assigned to individual users or groups. To align with the [Zero Trust guiding principles](/azure/security/fundamentals/zero-trust), use Just-In-Time and Just-Enough-Access policies when assigning roles.

  This article provides instructions on how to assign roles directly to users in the Microsoft Entra admin center.

prerequisites:
  summary: |
    Before assigning roles to users, review the following Microsoft Learn articles:
 
    - [Learn about Microsoft Entra roles](~/identity/role-based-access-control/concept-understand-roles.md)
    - [Learn about role based access control](/azure/role-based-access-control/rbac-and-directory-admin-roles)
    - [Explore the Azure built-in roles](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md)

    To use Privileged Identity Management, you must have a Microsoft Entra ID P2 or Microsoft Entra ID Governance license. For more information on licensing, see [Microsoft Entra ID Governance licensing fundamentals](../id-governance/licensing-fundamentals.md).

      Assign roles
    summary: |
      If you need to assign a role directly to a user, you select the user, choose the role, and adjust the settings. While assigning roles directly to users might be necessary for one-off scenarios, consider using groups to manage role assignments at scale. For more information, see [Use group to manage role assignments](../identity/role-based-access-control/groups-concept.md)
      
      Eligible roles are assigned to a user but must be elevated Just-In-Time by the user through Privileged Identity Management (PIM). For more information about how to use PIM, see [Privileged Identity Management](~/id-governance/privileged-identity-management/index.yml).
    steps: 
      - |
        Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as a [Privileged Role Administrator](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#privileged-role-administrator).
      - |
        Browse to **Entra ID** > **Users**.
      - |
        Search for and select the user getting the role assignment.

          If your organization has a Microsoft Entra ID P2, Microsoft Entra ID Governance, or Microsoft Entra Suite license, you can assign roles as either *eligible* or *active*.
          If your organization has a Free or Microsoft Entra ID P1 license, you can only assign roles as *active*.

          :::image type="content" source="media/entra-users-assign-role-azure-portal/role-assignment-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the role assignment settings.":::

        Leave the **Permanently eligible** option selected if the role should always be *available* to elevate for the user.

          If you uncheck this option, you can specify a date range for the role eligibility.

        Select the **Assign** button.

          Assigned roles appear in the associated section for the user, so eligible and active roles are listed separately.

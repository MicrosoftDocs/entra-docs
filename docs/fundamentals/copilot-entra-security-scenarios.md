# Microsoft Security Copilot scenarios in Microsoft Entra

Microsoft Security Copilot is a powerful tool that can help you manage and secure your Microsoft Entra identity environment. This article describes how to use Microsoft Security Copilot with Microsoft Entra in identity related scenarios to enhance your identity protection efforts. Using this feature requires a tenant with Microsoft Security Copilot enabled.

## Create Security Copilot prompts in the Microsoft Entra admin center

Security Copilot is a part of the Microsoft Entra admin center, and you can use it to create your own prompts. Security Copilot is launched from a globally available button in the menu bar. Choose from a set of starter prompts that appear at the top of the Security Copilot window or enter your own in the prompt bar to get started. Suggested prompts can appear after a response, which are predefined prompts that Security Copilot selects based on the prior response.

### Investigate alerts in Scenario Health Monitoring 

External Health Monitoring is a feature in Microsoft Entra that analyzes scenario-specific metrics for each tenant, detects anomalies, and raises alerts. These alerts are sent via the Microsoft Graph API and displayed in the Microsoft Entra admin center UI, enabling tenant admins to proactively investigate and address issues. For example, in the multifactor authentication (MFA) scenario, External Health Monitoring tracks metrics such as sign-in success rate, sign-in failure rate, and failure count. If there's a spike in failures, an alert is raised to notify the tenant admin, who can then take appropriate action to resolve the issue. 

Using this feature requires [Microsoft Entra ID P2 licenses](/entra/id-protection/overview-identity-protection#license-requirements) and a public cloud tenant.

The following roles can use this feature:

- [Reports Reader](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#reports-reader)
- [Helpdesk Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#helpdesk-administrator)
- [Security Reader](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#security-reader)
- [Security Operator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#security-operator)
- [Security Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#security-administrator)
- [Global Reader](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#global-reader)

The following example prompts can be used to investigate alerts in Scenario Health Monitoring:

- *What health alerts do I have in my tenant?*
- *What users are impacted according to the active health monitoring alerts?*
- *Show me health monitoring alert details for alert ID [alertId]*
- *Show me managed device health monitoring alerts*
- *Show me compliant device health monitoring alerts*
- *Show me device scenario health monitoring alerts*

### SLA in Scenario Health Monitoring

Microsoft Entra Health provides look-back reporting on Service Level Agreements (SLA) for authentication availability for your Microsoft Entra tenant. The SLA Attainment is a monthly look-back solution that shows the core authentication availability of Microsoft Entra ID each month. IT admins often need to review the SLA reports in conjunction with service outages. If availability dips below 99.99% in any given month, you might be eligible for service credits in alignment with the [Microsoft Entra SLA](/entra/identity/monitoring-health/reference-sla-performance). Security Copilot interacts with the Microsoft Entra SLA using the Microsoft Graph API.

Using this feature requires a minimum of the [Reports Reader](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#reports-reader) role.

The following example prompts can be used to get SLA information:

# Configure Microsoft Entra for Zero Trust: Monitor and detect cyberthreats

Having robust health monitoring and threat detection capabilities is one of the six pillars of the [Secure Future Initiative](https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/content/microsoftcorp/microsoft/final/en-us/microsoft-brand/documents/sfi-monitor-and-detect-cyberthreats.pdf). These guidelines are designed to help you set up a comprehensive logging system that provides standardized and accessible logs. We include recommendations related to the triage of risky sign-ins, risky users, and authentication methods.

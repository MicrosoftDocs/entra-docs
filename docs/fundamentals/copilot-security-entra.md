# Security Copilot in Microsoft Entra

**Applies to:** Microsoft Entra ![Green circle with a white check mark symbol.](../media/common/applies-to-yes.png)

[Microsoft Security Copilot](/security-copilot/microsoft-security-copilot) is a platform that brings together the power of AI and human expertise to help administrators and security teams respond to attacks faster and more effectively. Microsoft Entra is one of the Microsoft plugins that enable the Security Copilot platform to generate accurate and relevant information. Through this plugin, Security Copilot can help you investigate and resolve identity risks, assess identities and access with AI-driven intelligence, and complete complex tasks quickly. Security Copilot gets insights from your Microsoft Entra users, groups, sign-in logs, audit logs, and more. 

You can explore sign-ins and risky users, get contextualized insights on how to resolve incidents, learn how to protect accounts using natural language. Built on top of real-time machine learning, Security Copilot can help you find gaps in access policies, generate identity workflows, and troubleshoot faster. Security Copilot can assist with scenarios across different products in the Microsoft Entra admin center, such as an incident investigation that includes the Microsoft Entra ID Protection risky user reports and Microsoft Entra sign-in logs.

This article introduces you to Security Copilot in Microsoft Entra.

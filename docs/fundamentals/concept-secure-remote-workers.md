# Secure your organization's identities with Microsoft Entra ID

It can seem daunting trying to secure your workers in today's world, especially when you have to respond rapidly and provide access to many services quickly. This article is meant to provide a concise list of all the actions to take, helping you identify and prioritize which order to deploy the Microsoft Entra features based on the license type you own.

Microsoft Entra ID offers many features and provides many layers of security for your Identities, navigating which feature is relevant can sometimes be overwhelming. This document is intended to help organizations deploy services quickly, with secure identities as the primary consideration.

Each table provides a consistent security recommendation, protecting identities from common security attacks while minimizing user friction.

The guidance helps:

- Configure access to software as a service (SaaS) and on-premises applications in a secure and protected manner
- Both cloud and hybrid identities
- Users working remotely or in the office

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes that your cloud only or hybrid identities have been established in Microsoft Entra ID already. For help with choosing your identity type see the article, [Choose the right authentication (AuthN) method for your Microsoft Entra hybrid identity solution](~/identity/hybrid/connect/choose-ad-authn.md).

### Guided walkthrough

For a guided walkthrough of many of the recommendations in this article, see the [Set up Microsoft Entra ID](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2224193) guide when signed in to the Microsoft 365 Admin Center. To review best practices without signing in and activating automated setup features, go to the [Microsoft 365 Setup portal](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2221308).

## Guidance for Microsoft Entra ID Free, Office 365, or Microsoft 365 customers

There are many recommendations that Microsoft Entra ID Free, Office 365, or Microsoft 365 app customers should take to protect their user identities. The following table is intended to highlight key actions for the following license subscriptions:

- Office 365 (Office 365 E1, E3, E5, F1, A1, A3, A5)
- Microsoft 365 (Business Basic, Apps for Business, Business Standard, Business Premium, A1)
- Microsoft Entra ID Free (included with Azure, Dynamics 365, Intune, and Power Platform)

| Recommended action | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| [Enable Security Defaults](security-defaults.md) | Protect all user identities and applications by enabling multifactor authentication and blocking legacy authentication. |
| [Enable Password Hash Sync](~/identity/hybrid/connect/how-to-connect-password-hash-synchronization.md) (if using hybrid identities) | Provide redundancy for authentication and improve security (including Smart Lockout, IP Lockout, and the ability to discover leaked credentials). |
| [Enable AD FS smart lock out](/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/configure-ad-fs-extranet-smart-lockout-protection) (If applicable) | Protects your users from experiencing extranet account lockout from malicious activity. |
| [Enable Microsoft Entra smart lockout](~/identity/authentication/howto-password-smart-lockout.md) (if using managed identities) | Smart lockout helps to lock out bad actors who are trying to guess your users' passwords or use brute-force methods to get in. |
| [Disable end-user consent to applications](~/identity/enterprise-apps/configure-user-consent.md) | The admin consent workflow gives admins a secure way to grant access to applications that require admin approval so end users don't expose corporate data. Microsoft recommends disabling future user consent operations to help reduce your surface area and mitigate this risk. |
| [Integrate supported SaaS applications from the gallery to Microsoft Entra ID and enable single sign-on (SSO)](~/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal.md) | Microsoft Entra ID has a gallery that contains thousands of preintegrated applications. Some of the applications your organization uses are probably in the gallery accessible directly from the Azure portal. Provide access to corporate SaaS applications remotely and securely with improved user experience (single sign-on (SSO)). |
| [Automate user provisioning and deprovisioning from SaaS Applications](~/identity/app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md) (if applicable) | Automatically create user identities and roles in the cloud (SaaS) applications that users need access to. In addition to creating user identities, automatic provisioning includes the maintenance and removal of user identities as status or roles change, increasing your organization's security. |
| [Enable Secure hybrid access: Secure legacy apps with existing app delivery controllers and networks](~/identity/enterprise-apps/secure-hybrid-access.md) (if applicable) | Publish and protect your on-premises and cloud legacy authentication applications by connecting them to Microsoft Entra ID with your existing application delivery controller or network. |
| [Enable self-service password reset](~/identity/authentication/tutorial-enable-sspr.md) (applicable to cloud only accounts) | This ability reduces help desk calls and loss of productivity when a user can't sign in to their device or an application. |
| [Use least privileged roles where possible](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md) | Give your administrators only the access they need to only the areas they need access to. |
| [Enable Microsoft's password guidance](https://www.microsoft.com/research/publication/password-guidance/) | Stop requiring users to change their password on a set schedule, disable complexity requirements, and your users are more apt to remember their passwords and keep them something that is secure. |

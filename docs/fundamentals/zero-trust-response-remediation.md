# Accelerate response and remediation with the Zero Trust Assessment

The ability to rapidly detect, respond to, and remediate security threats is critical in today's evolving threat landscape. As one of the pillar of Microsoft's Secure Future Initiative (SFI), accelerating response and remediation focuses on enabling organizations to minimize the time between threat detection and containment. This pillar emphasizes automated, risk-based responses that reduce manual intervention and help prevent security incidents from escalating. The following Microsoft Entra Zero Trust assessment checks ensure your organization has the necessary controls in place to quickly identify and mitigate high-risk scenarios, protecting both user identities and workload identities through proactive security policies.

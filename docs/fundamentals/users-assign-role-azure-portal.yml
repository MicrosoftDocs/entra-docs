  Assign user roles with Microsoft Entra ID
introduction: |
  The ability to manage resources is granted by assigning roles that provide the required permissions. Roles can be assigned to individual users or groups. To align with the [Zero Trust guiding principles](/azure/security/fundamentals/zero-trust), use Just-In-Time and Just-Enough-Access policies when assigning roles.

prerequisites:
  summary: |
    Before assigning roles to users, review the following Microsoft Learn articles:
 
    - [Learn about Microsoft Entra roles](~/identity/role-based-access-control/concept-understand-roles.md)
    - [Learn about role based access control](/azure/role-based-access-control/rbac-and-directory-admin-roles)
    - [Explore the Azure built-in roles](~/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md)

      Assign roles
    summary: |
      There are two main steps to the role assignment process. First you select the role to assign. Then you adjust the role settings and duration. Eligible roles are assigned to a user but must be elevated Just-In-Time by the user through Privileged Identity Management (PIM). For more information about how to use PIM, see [Privileged Identity Management](~/id-governance/privileged-identity-management/index.yml).

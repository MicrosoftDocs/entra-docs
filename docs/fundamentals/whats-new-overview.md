# What's new (preview)

Microsoft Entra is updated regularly to deliver new features, enhance existing functionality, fix defects, and address customer feedback. The best way to stay current with these developments is to visit **What's new** (preview) in the [Microsoft Entra admin center](./entra-admin-center.md). 

**What's new** is an information hub that provides a consolidated view of the Microsoft Entra roadmap and change announcements. It gives administrators a centralized location to track, learn, and plan for the releases and changes across the Microsoft Entra family of products. 

The remaining sections describe the features and functionality of the **What's new** experience.
